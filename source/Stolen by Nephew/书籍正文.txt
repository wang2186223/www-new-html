###Chapter 1

My nephew begged me to pose as his girlfriend at his class reunion.
To my surprise, his classmates actually believed it.
They even pressured him to get intimate with me right then and there...

"Aunt Olivia, you have to help me this time. Just say you're my girlfriend and help me show up my classmates. I'm begging you..."
Liam Anderson moved closer from the adjacent couch, clutching my arm pleadingly.
Pretend to be my nephew's girlfriend?
I hesitated.

Seeing my reluctance, Liam's eyes welled up with urgency.
"Aunt Olivia, please say yes."
He wrapped his arms around me, burying his face against my chest.
"You're the most beautiful woman I know. You'll make me look so good in front of my friends. I already bragged about having a gorgeous girlfriend. Don't embarrass me."

My husband chuckled from nearby, amused by our nephew's dramatics.
"You've got quite the imagination, kid. Asking your aunt to play your girlfriend."

My cheeks flushed with irritation at my husband's indifference.
Meanwhile, Liam's physical proximity sent unexpected thrills through me.
The young man nuzzled persistently against me, his head brushing against sensitive areas.

Liam had grown into a tall, athletic young man—exactly the type of handsome youth I found appealing.
He wore a basketball jersey that showcased his well-defined muscles.
His powerful hands occasionally brushed against me during his movements, stirring flustered sensations.

Trying to ignore the tingling sensations, I shot my husband an exasperated look.
"What nonsense are you talking about? How could I pose as our nephew's girlfriend?"

Noticing my resistance, Liam intensified his nuzzling.
"Aunt Olivia, you're not that much older than me. A mature, voluptuous woman like you would dazzle everyone. Please help me out."

He lifted his gaze to meet mine, his chin nearly resting against my abdomen.
The intensity in his eyes focused on the curves outlined by my clothing, making me suspect ulterior motives.

Surprisingly, my husband showed no concern and even encouraged him.
"Fine, let your aunt go with you. But no taking advantage of her, or you'll answer to me."

"Don't worry, Uncle Noah. I'll treat you both to dinner. No funny business, I promise."
Liam's large hands settled on my waist as he happily rubbed against me again.

Being petite, I found myself easily lifted into his arms right in front of my husband.
"Thanks, Uncle! Hehe, Aunt Olivia, you're my girl now."

My husband snorted with laughter and rose from the couch.
"I'm going to bed."

Liam set me down but let his hands wander toward my lower back.
I glanced nervously toward the bedroom before shooting him a warning look.

How could my husband joke about Liam taking advantage of me?
"What do you think you're doing, you rascal? Hands off."

"No way! I'm not letting go. Aunt Olivia, just be my woman."
"Kid, do you even know what that means?"

I tried to push his hands away instinctively.
Liam leaned in with his handsome young face, eyes locked on mine.

"Aunt Olivia, you think I'm naive? I've been with plenty of women.
I just want to show you off because you're beautiful. Don't underestimate me."
###Chapter 2
Liam Anderson's large hand squeezed my rounded bottom firmly, clicking his tongue in appreciation.

"Aunt Olivia, your figure is truly the perfect fuckdoll. Other women can't compare to you at all. Come with me quickly to change clothes."

He released me and walked toward his bedroom.

That forceful squeeze had left my body weak and unsteady.

His sudden release nearly made me stumble.

He glanced back at me with an inexplicable look in his eyes.

"Aunt Olivia, it seems my uncle can't satisfy you normally. Just a few touches from me and you're already like this. How about this—change your clothes first."

He took my hand and led me to his room.

On Liam's bed lay two blue intimate garments, both narrow strips of fabric, alongside a black skirt.

He pointed at the clothes, growing impatient.

"Aunt Olivia, stop looking. Hurry and put them on. We have to leave for the gathering soon. You'll look incredibly sexy in this—way hotter than those inexperienced girlfriends my classmates found."

"But these clothes..."

My face flushed instantly.

"How am I supposed to wear what you've picked out, you naughty boy?"

"What do you mean how? Aunt Olivia, if you don't know how to put them on, I can help you."

Liam stepped closer as he spoke.

Blushing, I pushed him away, but my heart fluttered unexpectedly.

I hadn't thought he would actually offer to help.

My husband was still asleep in the next room. What if he saw this?

Liam readily stepped back. "Aunt Olivia, hurry up and change. We're running out of time."

Only when he turned around did I feel safe enough to pick up the clothes.

But the fabric was so scant that my curvy figure would be on full display.

The thought of wearing such revealing clothing in front of my nephew filled me with shame. I worried Liam might turn around, so I rushed to change.

The more I hurried, the more mistakes I made. I misaligned a strap in the back and couldn't fix it no matter how I tried.

In my panic, Liam suddenly turned around.

"Aunt Olivia, let me help you."

"N-no need..."

I tried to refuse instinctively, but he was already behind me, his large hands grasping the misaligned strap.

His warm hands brushed against my back as if by accident, sending a shiver through my body.

"Stop squirming, Aunt Olivia. You're making it hard for me to focus."

His teasing words made my face burn with embarrassment. "I'm your aunt. Don't joke like that."

Liam chuckled. "I'm just being honest. Look how you're trembling. My uncle doesn't know how to enjoy a body like yours—what a waste."

My blush deepened. Whether intentional or not, Liam fastened the straps painfully slowly.

His hands kept brushing against my back, stirring heat within me.

My whole body trembled uncontrollably.

"I... I need to use the restroom."

Afraid I might humiliate myself in front of Liam, I rushed to the bathroom.

After calming down, I returned to the living room.

Liam was waiting for me.

We left together for the KTV where he had arranged to meet his classmates.

Inside the private room, I saw Liam's friends.
###Chapter 3

The room was filled with young men and women, radiating youthful energy.

The moment I stepped inside, multiple sets of eyes locked onto me.

The men gazed at me with intense heat, as if unable to look away.

Liam Anderson proudly wrapped his arm around my waist and introduced me to everyone.

"This is my girlfriend, Olivia Evans. Olivia, these are my classmates..."

In front of his classmates, Liam didn't call me Aunt.

After Liam's introduction, the men all stood up one after another.

"Liam, you lucky dog! How did you manage to land such a stunning girlfriend?"

"Honestly, she's the real treasure. Look at that figure, and those huge melons! I'm green with envy."

"Olivia, what do you see in Liam? I'm way better than him. Dump him and be with me instead."

They crowded around me, making bold jokes without restraint.

Under the colorful disco lights, I noticed the girls sitting on the couch in the private room looked displeased.

I instinctively glanced at Liam, but strangely, he didn't seem angry at all. Instead, he appeared quite pleased.

Probably my presence boosted his ego, making him so happy.

I didn't overthink it. To avoid awkwardness, I greeted everyone and pulled Liam to sit on the couch.

I also said hello to the girls.

They were just young girls, after all. Jealousy was natural, and I didn't want to make enemies.

Young people's emotions come and go quickly. Soon, everyone started drinking and playing games.

Liam seemed to genuinely treat me as his girlfriend, keeping his large hand firmly on my waist.

He even deliberately rubbed it a few times.

His touches made me tremble. Fortunately, the room was dimly lit, and everyone was focused on the game, so no one noticed.

Not wanting to ruin the mood, I endured without saying anything.

After all, my current role was Liam's girlfriend.

After some drinking, someone suggested playing spin the bottle. Whichever couple the bottle pointed to had to kiss and hug in public.

Kissing and hugging in front of everyone!

These young people really dared to play boldly. Amid my astonishment, cheers erupted around me.

"Liam, hurry up! We want to see a French kiss! No pecks allowed!"

Seeing the bottle pointing directly at Liam, I realized what was happening.

I had to kiss Liam... I instantly flushed bright red with embarrassment.

Liam leaned close to my ear and whispered, "Aunt, please help me out one more time. Otherwise, we'll be exposed."

I instinctively wanted to refuse.

Before I could speak, Liam pulled me into his arms and lowered his head.

His warm lips pressed against my cherry-like mouth. A tingling sensation spread through my body, making me tremble uncontrollably.

The cheers around us continued.

Being kissed by my nephew in front of so many people... I was utterly mortified.

Stimulation and shame made my skin flush pink all over.

I felt as if a faucet inside me had been turned on.

The already narrow thong became soaked.

As Liam grew increasingly bold, trying to pry open my lips, I instinctively tried to push him away.

Unexpectedly, his large hand slipped under my skirt and yanked off my thong.
###Chapter 4
That tingling sensation nearly overwhelmed me.
With so many people still here, he actually dared to do this.

Fortunately, Liam didn’t proceed further.
He stopped after pulling it down.

The warmth faded, leaving me strangely unsettled.

Once the task was completed, everyone started spinning the bottle again.
But I grew distracted.

The lingering warmth on my lips replayed in my mind.
I tried to shake off the memory by reaching for my glass.

After several drinks, dizziness began to set in.
Liam leaned close to my ear, his voice dripping with implication.

"Aunt Olivia, you smell even better than a young girl."

I turned instinctively and saw him holding my thong, inhaling deeply.

Even in the dim light of the private room, someone might notice.
I frantically tried to snatch it back from him.

But Liam swiftly passed it to the guy beside him.

My face flushed crimson with humiliation.

How could Liam hand my thong to another male classmate?

It was then I realized all the female classmates were drunk, passed out on the couches.
The few still awake were making out with their boyfriends, oblivious to anyone else.

The guy who received the thong took an exaggerated whiff.

"Big sister’s scent is intoxicating. Liam, we’re brothers—good things should be shared.
I want a taste of her too."

"Count me in."

Several guys moved closer toward me.

Liam scooped me into his arms.
"These are my good friends, Olivia. I know you’ve been lacking affection lately.
Let us show you some love."

Already disoriented, surrounded by so many young men, their alcohol-laced scents overwhelmed me.
My dizziness intensified.

Through hazy vision, I felt myself being lifted onto the table.
Multiple hands roamed over my body.

It felt like countless ants crawling over my skin, igniting an unbearable itch.
I instinctively tugged at my clothes.

"Big sister is so eager. We shouldn’t hold back then."

"Look at those milkers—I could devour them."

Amid the feverish heat, I felt my skirt being pushed up...

In that moment, morality vanished.
I only wanted to lose myself in the sensation.

Then, a knock sounded at the door.

"Sorry to interrupt, folks. We’re conducting a routine fire inspection.
Could you please open the door?"

KTV staff kept knocking outside—a surprise safety check.

The hands withdrew from my body.
As the haze lifted, regret washed over me.

What had I almost done?
I nearly crossed a line with my nephew and his friends...

When I glanced at Liam, I saw unmistakable frustration in his eyes.

The knocking persisted.
Liam and the others helped me off the table.

Everyone in the room froze, then retreated to the couches.
Someone finally opened the door, flooding the room with light.

The brightness magnified my shame.

Fearful of losing control again, I claimed illness and rushed out.
With staff present, no one tried to stop me.

Outside, the cool air cleared my mind.
I vowed never to put myself in such a situation again.

Thank goodness the inspection interrupted us.
If things had gone further, how could I ever face Liam—or my husband?
###Chapter 5
I returned home to find my husband still sound asleep.
Unable to calm my restless mind, I decided to take a shower.

As I stepped out of the bathroom, I saw Liam Anderson sitting in the living room.
His expression was dark and troubled.

The memory of what happened at the KTV still made me uneasy.
But as the elder, I felt I should approach him with concern.

“Liam, you’re back. Is everything alright?”

His face grew even darker when he saw me.
He suddenly grabbed my wrist.

The gesture startled me.
I thought he might be trying to revisit what happened between us.
I quickly tried to pull away.

“Don’t… not like this. Your uncle is still asleep in the bedroom.”

He paused at my words, then offered a bitter smile.
“Aunt, you’ve got it wrong. That’s not what I meant.”

I felt embarrassed. I had misunderstood his intention.
But something still felt off.

“Liam, what’s going on? You look upset.”

I wondered if my early return had caused some problem for him.

He released my hand and ran his fingers through his hair in frustration.
“It’s bad, Aunt. Really bad.”

My heart sank. Something was terribly wrong.

I pressed him for details.

He explained that someone had taken photos at the KTV.
One of his classmates had shown him the pictures before he came home.

They were photos of me on the table, surrounded by men taking advantage.

Liam had immediately demanded the classmate delete them.
But the guy refused—he said I had to come see him personally.

The implication was clear.

“Aunt, don’t worry. I’ll handle this. If he won’t delete them, I’ll steal his phone. Or fight him if I have to.”

His voice grew more intense, almost reckless.

I was touched that he wanted to protect me.
But I couldn’t let him risk himself for my sake.

“I’ll go with you,” I said firmly. “Let’s see what he wants. If he refuses, we’ll call the police.”

“No! We can’t involve the police!”

His reaction surprised me.

Seeing my confusion, he quickly explained, “If we push him, he might post those photos online. Or send them to Uncle. Then no one would believe us, even if we told the truth.”

I understood then. He was trying to protect my reputation.

“Alright,” I nodded. “No police. But I need to know what he wants.”

Probably money. Or me.
If it was money, maybe we could manage.
But if it was me… I would never agree.

Giving in would only lead to endless blackmail.

If things went wrong, I decided I would call the police behind Liam’s back.
I’d rather face shame than drag him down with me.
###Chapter 6
This matter weighed heavily on my mind, leaving me restless throughout the night.

The next day, I accompanied Liam Anderson to the hotel where the man had arranged to meet.
Having resolved to burn my bridges, I brought a voice recorder with me before leaving.
I intended to record evidence of his threats against us.

I still hadn’t told Liam about my plan.
Since I wanted to keep him out of it, it was better he remained unaware.
This would also prevent him from accidentally revealing anything.

We arrived at the hotel room and met Liam’s classmate, Noah Lopez.
His eyes scanned me up and down the moment he saw me.
He finally remarked with a meaningful tone.

"I watched the video on my phone all night long. That body is absolutely incredible. Liam, if your girlfriend spends one night with me, I’ll give you the video. How about that?"

Liam snorted. "Noah, aren’t you going too far?"

"Everyone desires beautiful things. What’s so wrong about that? This is my only condition. Think about it."

Listening to their conversation, I firmly refused.
"I will never do anything with you!"

Noah chuckled at my response and stepped closer to us.
He shoved me toward Liam.
"If you don’t want to do it with me, how about with Liam?
You two are dating, after all.
Just do it once right here in front of me. Let me enjoy the show."

I never expected Noah to make such a demand.
If Liam and I were truly in a relationship, it might be different.
But we weren’t.
There was no way I could agree.

When I refused this request as well, Noah’s expression turned vicious.
He waved his phone menacingly.
"If you don’t agree, I’ll upload this video online right now."

Liam quickly stopped him. "Wait a moment."

He pulled me aside and whispered in my ear.
"Aunt, maybe we should just do it this once.
If neither of us speaks about it, no one will ever know.
It’s better than being with Noah."

I had already prepared myself for a final showdown and wasn’t inclined to accept Liam’s suggestion.
But then I reconsidered.
If doing it just this once could resolve everything, it might be worth it.
After all, Liam was also involved.
If I reported this to the police, he would inevitably be implicated.

Seeing my hesitation, Liam wrapped his arm around my waist and guided me further into the room.
"Noah, we’ll agree to your terms, but you must promise not to record anything."

Noah cooperatively set his phone aside.
Liam tossed my purse to the floor, lifted me, and threw me onto the bed.
His large hands roamed wildly over my body, stirring a growing heat within me.
My initial resistance gradually gave way to anticipation and excitement.

As Liam’s warm hands explored every inch of my skin, my body flushed with a rosy hue.
I even forgot Noah was in the room.
###Chapter 7

A sudden horn blared outside.

"There's a fire downstairs. All guests must evacuate immediately."

The smell of thick smoke quickly filled the air.

Liam Anderson had been about to tear off my thong. His face darkened instantly at the announcement.

He even cursed under his breath.

"Why did there have to be a fire now?"

His words stunned me.

Wasn't this interruption a good thing?

Why did Liam seem so disappointed?

The priority now was to get out quickly.

Liam got off the bed with obvious reluctance.

We left the room together.

Chaos had already erupted outside. Everyone was rushing toward the exits.

Fire trucks had arrived by the time we reached the lobby. They quickly brought the fire under control.

Thankfully, the other rooms suffered minimal damage.

The hotel needed temporary repairs and couldn't accommodate guests. They offered full refunds.

Noah Lopez was still dissatisfied. But with this incident, our plans were ruined. He told us to meet him at another hotel that evening.

I breathed a sigh of relief. At least nothing would happen today.

Noah went to handle the refund. As I prepared to leave, Liam said he had school matters to attend to. He told me to go home first.

I didn't think much of it. I planned to hail a taxi on the street.

But as I reached the curb, I remembered something.

My bag was still in the hotel room. The voice recorder was inside.

What if Noah found it?

I hurried back to the hotel. Entering the lobby, I saw Noah and Liam standing together.

Guests were lining up to check out. The two men weren't in line. They stood off to the side, talking.

Didn't Liam say he had to go back to school? Why was he still with Noah?

Hiding to the side, I watched them. I wanted to see what Liam was doing.

I worried he might impulsively attack Noah. I needed to be ready to stop him.

"If all else fails, come to my rented place tonight. I guarantee no interruptions," Noah said.

Liam nodded beside him. "Damn it. Two failures already. Nothing can go wrong tonight."

"Don't worry. It will work tonight. The KTV video was too blurry. This time I'll get a high-definition recording."

"But I'm curious, Liam. Why are you so determined to ruin your aunt's reputation? It would destroy her life."

Liam's face twisted with sudden rage. His fists clenched tightly.

"I'm already going easy on her. If not for her, my father wouldn't have died. I wouldn't be living this dependent life."

Noah sighed and patted Liam's shoulder. "My condolences. I'll help you."

Their words made me tremble uncontrollably.

Clutching my pounding heart, I took a detour. I headed upstairs through another route.

I reached the room door, still breathing heavily.

Only now did I understand. Everything was part of Liam's elaborate scheme.

Even asking me to pretend to be his girlfriend was just an excuse. He wanted to do something to me at the KTV.

The fire inspection interrupted them there. The blurred video made them plan a second attempt.
###Chapter 8
Liam Anderson did all this to ruin my reputation and destroy me completely.
He believed his father's death was my fault.

Months ago, his father and I were in a car accident while running errands together.
Liam's father died instantly.

His mother had passed away long ago, so he relied heavily on his father.
After the tragedy, my husband and I decided to take Liam into our home.

Since no compensation was awarded, Liam assumed I had stolen the money.
It made sense to him—I was also in the accident, so the compensation might have gone to me.

But he didn’t know the truth.

That day, I had introduced a client to his father, and we all had dinner together.
Afterward, his father drank a little and insisted on driving home.
I suggested getting a designated driver, but he refused.
We argued about it.

Worried about his safety, I got in the car with him.
Soon after we left, he tried to drive against traffic.
Before I could stop him, we collided with an oncoming truck.

The impact spun our car around.
His father hit his head on the steering wheel and died instantly.

Drunk driving and going the wrong way made us fully liable.
I even covered the medical bills for the other driver.

To protect his father’s memory, my husband and I agreed not to tell Liam the truth.
We let him believe it was just an ordinary accident.

I never imagined he would resent me so much.
Or that he would devise such a cruel plan for revenge.

To prevent him from sinking deeper into bitterness, I decided to tell him everything.

After retrieving my bag from the room, I felt calmer.
As I walked downstairs, I saw Liam and Noah Lopez finishing checkout.
They both stared at me in shock, their eyes filled with panic.

Liam immediately tried to explain.
“Noah and I were just—”

I cut him off with a wave.
“No need. I heard everything.”

His face paled.
“What… what did you hear?”

I walked toward the exit.
“Liam, come outside. I need to talk to you.”

He looked confused but followed me out.

Standing on the sidewalk under the sun, he looked young and handsome.
I didn’t want such a bright soul consumed by hatred.

“Liam, if I had known you’d hate me this much, I would have told you the truth sooner.”

He stared intently, searching my eyes for honesty.

I calmly explained everything.
“The hospitals and traffic police have records. You can verify it yourself. Every word I’ve said is true.”

Then I turned and left him standing there, stunned.

The truth can be cruel. I never wanted to expose it, but I had no choice.
Letting him live in hatred would have destroyed us both.

That evening, Liam returned home and knelt before me.
“Aunt Olivia, I’m sorry… I never knew you did all this for me.”

My husband looked confused, unaware of what had happened.

I explained the entire story to him, including Liam’s intentional scheme.
My husband sighed with a bitter smile, his heart aching.

“Liam, your aunt and I have always treated you like our own. She even decided not to have children because she wanted to focus on you. How could you be so foolish?”

Liam froze at those words.
He kowtowed to us, then stood up with determination.

“Uncle, Aunt Olivia, I was wrong. I’ll take care of you both when you’re older. But I’m an adult now—I want to move out.”

I knew he felt awkward staying, so I agreed.

I never truly blamed him.

Liam visits often now and no longer behaves inappropriately.
We have become true family, bound not by blood but by love.
