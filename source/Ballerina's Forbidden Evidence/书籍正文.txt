###Chapter 1

"You were born with the talent to become a dancer."

Who would have thought that what sounded like praise would nearly destroy me?

For others, that dance studio was a place where dreams came true.

For me, it was a living nightmare I barely escaped.

My name is Fiona Valentine, a ballet student.

Perhaps due to early maturity, my body developed faster than most—especially my chest.

My dance instructor had warned me more than once that if this continued, I’d have to switch dance styles. Ballet wouldn’t be an option anymore.

That day, I went to the studio for my usual practice.

But after class, Mr. Ryan Lowell kept me behind. "The State Championship is next month. Why haven’t you mastered the routine yet?"

I bit my lip. "I’ve been practicing, but without a partner, it’s not the same."

Last month, my dance partner, Ethan Roland, was injured and hospitalized. The pas de deux—a duet meant for a man and a woman—was missing half, drastically reducing the quality of my training.

"There’s no time for slow progress. Come here. I’ll be your partner," he ordered.

I didn’t dare refuse.

Ryan’s large hands settled on my waist—lower than usual, dangerously close to my hips.

"Turn. Arch back."

I twisted my body and bent backward.

"Grand jeté."

At the same time, Ryan stepped forward sharply, his right leg sliding between mine. His hands gripped the small of my back, lifting me into the air.

Following his momentum, I leaped, executing a perfect split midair.

Then—I felt his left hand brush against my inner thigh.

"Ah! Wait, sir—!"

Panicked, I tried to pull away.

But Ryan’s gaze wasn’t where I feared. His hands remained in place, seemingly innocent.

Was I imagining things?

He lowered me but gave no time to think. "Your basics are weak. Don’t you know you’re supposed to keep your head up during an aerial split?"

I kept my eyes down. My leotard had a plunging neckline and clung tightly to my body, making partnered practice awkward.

My previous partner had always been careful to avoid uncomfortable contact. But now, Ryan had taken his place.

To avoid exposure, I held back in certain movements.

Yet in ballet, physical interaction between partners was essential. Mastering difficult lifts and sequences was part of the art.

I couldn’t hunch forever.

"Move on to the next set," Ryan commanded.

I took a deep breath, pushing away my unease, and forced myself to continue.

This sequence was the climax of the routine. I had to hook one leg over my partner’s shoulder, perform a split, then arch back as he spun me.

Even mentally prepared, when Ryan’s grip tightened and his hands began sliding lower, I couldn’t stay silent.

"Sir… your hands—"
###Chapter 2

Ryan glanced down. "You don't have enough strength, and your hips are your body's support point. If I don’t hold you, what if you get hurt? Lift your toes a little higher."

His stern expression left me no choice. I gritted my teeth and rose onto my toes again.

But this made our bodies brush against each other unavoidably. With my right leg suspended midair, all my weight pressed onto the tip of my left foot.

Soon, I was panting, my body trembling, desperate for the session to end.

Then, out of nowhere, Ryan blew a warm breath against my stomach.

That spot was already sensitive, and I was exhausted. The heat seemed to seep into my very soul, melting my strength. My legs gave out, and I collapsed to the floor.

Too weak to even cover my chest, I lay sprawled on the ground, gasping for air. I waved a hand at him. "Teacher... I can’t go on. Let’s stop for today."

Ryan crouched beside me, his gaze unwavering. "Fine. You’ve trained hard today. While your body’s warmed up, let’s work on your hip flexor stretch. It’ll be more effective now."

I knew he was right. Struggling, I tried to do it myself.

But Ryan stopped me. "You’re too weak to stretch properly. Let me help."

I obeyed, my cheeks burning.

Too weak? The phrasing felt odd.

Still, I lay back on the yoga mat as instructed.

Ryan pressed my knees down slowly, his face inching closer to mine.

The position was humiliating, but as my legs spread wider, the escalating pain from the stretch left me powerless to resist.

When my legs finally touched the floor, Ryan’s face was nearly pressed against my stomach.

I glanced down. The thin fabric of my leotard had stretched dangerously thin during training, leaving little to the imagination.

Flustered, I instinctively covered myself.

"Lie still. Arms out. What are you hiding? Your dancing is mediocre, but your fidgeting is top-notch."

Scolded, I bit my lip and reluctantly spread my arms.

My mind raced. Why isn’t my instructor a woman?

Even if Ryan was professional, shouldn’t there be boundaries? Especially in such an embarrassing position!

Then he shifted again. His knees pinned my legs, his arms trapped mine, his body pressing down as he moved rhythmically. "Arch your back. Deep breaths. Follow my count—1, 2, 3, 4..."

I was done. This position was practically...

And with my leotard so tight, every deep breath pressed me even closer against him...
###Chapter 3

The scolding I’d just endured left me too afraid to resist. I could only grit my teeth and endure.

“Mr. Lowell… please, let’s switch positions. I can’t hold this anymore…”

“It’s barely been any time. The other girls can hold it for half an hour.” Ryan stepped back, releasing his weight from me. “Your back muscles are too tight. Let me stretch them for you.”

Without giving me a chance to refuse, he flipped me over, gripped my waist, and jerked me into position with a force that sent waves of soreness through every muscle and tendon.

My dancer’s flexibility meant nothing as he pressed down hard on my lower back, forcing me into the exact pose he wanted.

“Chest up. Abs in. Hips lifted.” Ryan pressed his lower stomach against my tailbone, yanking my arms back with brutal force.

“Ah! Not so hard…!”

I arched my back, tilting my hips upward, silently enduring the pain.

Ten agonizing minutes later, when Ryan finally released me, I collapsed onto the yoga mat, completely drained, barely conscious.

I didn’t even have the strength to protest when his hands lingered a little too long on my backside.

“Mr. Lowell… I really can’t take anymore. Please, just let me go…”

He shook his head and moved closer. “Today’s session was intense. You need to cool down properly, or you’ll be sore all over tomorrow.”

Ryan pulled out a massage gun—a sleek device with a soft silicone head, a power button, and a charging port at the base.

I’d used one before. The deep muscle relief was unforgettable.

Before I could refuse, he flipped the switch, dragged me into position, and pressed the vibrating head against my thigh.

“Ah—!” A jolt of sensation shot straight to my core, wrenching a sharp cry from my lips.

Then he adjusted the setting, and the vibrations intensified.

“No—stop—!” Overwhelmed, I writhed, desperate to escape, but Ryan held me down effortlessly.

Finally, with one rough motion, he tore open my leotard…
###Chapter 4

Panicked, I acted on instinct and sank my teeth into Ryan’s arm with all my strength. The pain made him howl, and he instinctively jerked his hand away.

Seizing the moment, I kicked him hard between the legs. Ignoring his agonized screams, I scrambled to my feet and stumbled out of the dance studio.

I rushed into the locker room and immediately locked the door, pressing my back against it as I gasped for air.

Before I could catch my breath, footsteps approached from outside. "Fiona, open the door!"

It was Ryan. He had followed me here. My hands trembled uncontrollably, my lips quivering like a frightened rabbit.

"Come out. Let’s talk."

Even with the door locked, I shoved my weight against it, terrified.

"Get lost!" I shrieked, my voice breaking.

"Fiona, calm down. Let’s discuss this—" His hand twisted the doorknob, sending chills down my spine. I screamed, cutting him off.

"I’ll call the police if you don’t leave!"

"Don’t! This will only cause a scandal. Do you want everyone gossiping about you?" His tone was coaxing, but laced with panic.

My face paled, lips pressed tight, eyes wide with fear. I couldn’t bear to hear another word.

He wouldn’t back down until forced. With shaking hands, I pulled out my phone, scrolled to Chloe’s number, and hit dial—putting it on speaker so he could hear.

"I’ve already called the police!" I threatened, my voice raw with desperation. "If you don’t leave now, I’ll tell them everything!"

The silence outside told me he was stunned.

"Fine, I’m leaving. Don’t overreact." His footsteps retreated hastily until all sound faded. Only then did my legs give out, and I slid to the floor.

Hugging my knees, I curled into the corner, overwhelmed by helplessness and terror. My thoughts tangled into a suffocating mess.

Then, Chloe’s voice finally came through the phone. "Fiona? What’s wrong?"

The warmth in her tone shattered me. Tears burst forth like a broken dam.

Chloe had been my best friend since childhood. I could trust her with anything.

"Why are you crying? Tell me what happened. I’ll make it right."

Between sobs, I recounted everything.

"That bastard! We’ll ruin him!" Chloe’s fury crackled through the line.

Suing him was possible—but the real problem was proof. My word alone wouldn’t be enough. I’d escaped before things went too far, leaving no physical evidence.

And if I pushed this, he’d retaliate. That fear coiled tight in my chest.
###Chapter 5

That State Championship opportunity meant everything to me. If I could achieve a decent result—better yet, win an award—it would secure my graduate recommendation.

My parents had gone to great lengths, both financially and otherwise, to pave the way for me into this elite dance academy.

Was I really going to let their expectations crumble just for the sake of pride?

Chloe considered this too and decided to get me out of the studio first before making any plans. She dropped everything, hailed a cab, and rushed over without a second’s delay.

Only when her familiar figure appeared before me did my heart finally settle back into place, as if I’d been brought back to life.

We ended up at Chloe’s off-campus apartment, lying in bed and holding each other for warmth, just like we used to as kids.

"Fiona, if there’s really no other way, maybe you should tell your parents. They’ll handle everything for you."

Chloe wasn’t wrong—sometimes, you have to turn to your parents. But I hesitated.

My parents were always swamped with work. They barely had time for me, content to just enroll me in dance classes and wash their hands of the rest.

If I told them, they’d probably just hand everything over to their lawyer. They wouldn’t have time to deal with my trivial problems.

I shook my head. "You know how busy they are. I don’t want to trouble them."

Chloe opened her mouth to say something, then stopped herself. "Then we’ll find the evidence ourselves. Tomorrow, we’ll check the surveillance footage. There’s no way Ryan can control everything!"

I nodded firmly, suddenly feeling a surge of strength.

The next day, I mustered my courage and returned to the dance studio.

"Sorry, but we have rules. I can’t just show surveillance footage to anyone," the security guard said flatly, shutting me down.

"Please, sir, this is really important. Just let me see the footage from yesterday afternoon!" I pleaded with everything I had, but the guard wouldn’t budge.

"You kids have too much time on your hands. Get out of here!"

I was about to push further when his next words froze me in place.

"If you don’t leave now, I’ll call your teacher to come get you."

Ryan’s terrifying face flashed in my mind. I stiffened, not daring to move.

Better not provoke him. Defeated, I left the security office.

As soon as I stepped outside, I turned—and there he was. A familiar figure, his hawk-like eyes locked onto me.
###Chapter 6

Our eyes met from across the room, and I felt my blood run cold. My hands trembled, unsure where to place them, while a clammy sweat broke out across my palms.

It was Ryan Lowell.

His expression was rigid and severe, devoid of any warmth.

After staring at me for a long moment, he suddenly took a step forward—toward me.

I froze for a few seconds before realizing his intent. My heart pounded wildly, and I immediately turned to leave.

"Fiona, stop! I just want to say two things." His voice was loud and forceful. Afraid he might draw attention, I halted, keeping a safe distance between us.

I crossed my arms defensively. "Stay right there. Don't come any closer!"

Ryan raised his hands in surrender, and only then did I relax slightly.

"Whatever you have to say, make it quick. I'm leaving soon..."

His dark eyes bore into me, his lips twisting into a mocking, threatening smirk. "About what happened yesterday—you'd better keep your mouth shut. If word gets out, it won't end well for anyone."

He paused, then added with deliberate emphasis, "You wouldn’t want to lose your spot in the State Championship, would you?"

I swallowed hard, my mind racing. Chloe’s words echoed in my ears.

That competition meant everything to me. But could I really stay silent just to protect my own interests? Let a predator like him continue lurking in our dance class?

I had escaped this time by sheer luck. Who would be his next victim?

After an intense internal struggle, my conscience won. I couldn’t let this go. Everyone needed to see his true nature.

"Even if I lose my spot, I won’t let a scumbag like you walk free! I’ll make sure everyone knows exactly what you are!"

I shouted the words with all my strength, feeling an immediate rush of relief.

"Go ahead. See who’d believe a kid’s word over mine."

Ryan scoffed, looking at me with condescension before turning and striding away.

Whether I could take him down or not, at least I had done what was right.

Finding the surveillance footage alone would be nearly impossible. Maybe I needed help—someone with more authority to investigate.

The next day, I returned to the dance studio. But attending class was out of the question. Just the thought of seeing Ryan again made me sick.

This time, I was here to see Principal Richard Roland.

The prestigious art training academy had strict policies, but I hoped he would intervene if I reported everything directly.

Principal Roland was kind and approachable, often chatting casually with students. I trusted he would help me.

My thoughts were interrupted by a familiar voice.

"Fiona, where have you been these past few days?" Raina asked, concerned.

Too much had happened, and Raina wasn’t exactly known for keeping secrets. I couldn’t risk telling her yet.

"I wasn’t feeling well," I lied.

She hesitated, and I could guess what was coming next.

"You’re here about the State Championship, aren’t you?"

Her surprised reaction confirmed it. "You already know?"

My heart sank.

Ryan had kept his word—he’d stripped me of my competition eligibility.

Just then, Ryan himself walked in. His gaze locked onto me, cold and triumphant, as if silently declaring his victory.
###Chapter 7

I clenched my fists silently, my resolve hardening to expose his true, ugly nature.

Just wait and see.

Leaving the dance studio, I headed straight for the top floor to find the principal’s office. This was the administrative area, a place I’d never set foot in during all my years at school. It was my first time venturing up here.

Walking down the corridor, I finally spotted the sign for the principal’s office.

The silence was unnerving. The only sound was my own footsteps. Summoning my courage, I knocked on the door. No response.

I waited for what felt like an eternity, but still, nothing. Just as I raised my hand to knock again, a door behind me suddenly creaked open.

Startled like a rabbit, I spun around.

The door labeled "Vice Principal’s Office" had swung open without warning.

"Come in."

Glancing back at the still-locked principal’s office, I swallowed hard and stepped inside.

Vice Principal Vincent Lowell was an enigmatic figure, someone we students rarely interacted with.

"Principal Richard is away on business. What do you need?"

The man looked to be in his forties or fifties, his expression stern and unreadable. A thick beard added a touch of severity to his already imposing presence.

All the words I’d prepared suddenly lodged in my throat.

When I didn’t speak, he didn’t even bother looking at me. His tone carried a hint of impatience. "Well?"

"Vice Principal Lowell, I want to report something."

At that, his eyes finally flicked to me—cold, dismissive, and probing.

"Report what?"

Gathering my courage, I laid out everything that had happened the day before.

"So… you’re accusing Ryan Lowell of misconduct?"

After hearing me out, his expression didn’t so much as twitch. A detached smile played on his lips.

I nodded emphatically. I didn’t know if coming to him was the right choice, but he was my only option now.

"Ryan is my nephew. Do you really think I don’t know what kind of person he is?"

His words hit me like a sledgehammer. My ears rang, and a cold shiver slithered down my spine. My nails dug into my palms.

Vice Principal Lowell was Ryan’s uncle. Now, remembering the threat Ryan had thrown at me earlier, everything made sense.

No wonder he acted with such arrogance in the dance class—he had protection from above. And I’d just handed my grievances straight to the enemy.

Vice Principal Lowell narrowed his eyes, his warning laced with menace. "Have you been watching too many dramas, imagining things about your teacher? I don’t want to hear this nonsense again. If any more rumors reach my ears, I’ll have you up here for a little chat, young lady."

His authority was absolute. He didn’t need to raise his voice—just sitting there, he exuded intimidation.

My blood ran cold. A numbing dread coiled around me, leaving me disoriented.

I practically fled downstairs, too panicked to wait for the elevator. Taking the stairs two at a time, I stumbled to a stop at the bottom, gasping for air. A storm of emotions crashed over me. My heart pounded wildly, my throat dry as sandpaper.

By sheer bad luck, I’d stumbled upon Ryan’s protector—and worse, I’d revealed my plans to report him.

They’d definitely compare notes after I left. How was I supposed to survive in dance class now?

Would Ryan grow even bolder?

Not only had I failed to bring him down, but I’d also painted a target on my own back.

The sky darkened, heavy with the promise of rain. I braced my hands on my knees, gulping in air, as if the world had drained of all color.

What was I supposed to do?

How could I fight Ryan when he had the vice principal backing him?

A wave of helplessness and tears surged up. Fat drops spilled from my eyes, splashing to the ground like broken strings. Each one carried the weight of my unspeakable anguish.

It felt like a hand was twisting inside my chest, agony and despair closing in on me.

Was I just supposed to swallow this injustice?

I couldn’t accept that.

Covering my face, I sank to the ground and sobbed. I had no idea what to do.

Then, my phone buzzed in my pocket.
###Chapter 8

I wiped away my tears and pulled out my phone. It was a message from my dance partner, Ethan Roland.

"Fiona, I heard what happened. Why would they suddenly cancel your spot for no reason?"

I bit my lower lip, unsure where to begin. Should I tell him everything?

We had met in dance class. He was kind, and we hit it off immediately. We became partners, preparing for the State Championship together.

But a few days ago, he got injured. I had promised to visit him, but everything else had gotten in the way.

After my reckless actions earlier, I realized I couldn’t fight this battle alone. Personal perspectives were too limited—I needed broader input.

Maybe Ethan could help. We were both in the dance program, and two minds were better than one.

I wiped my tears, steadied myself, and stood up.

After buying some of his favorite fruits at the hospital entrance, I headed to his room.

Ethan was lying in bed, cracking sunflower seeds. He looked lively, nothing like a patient.

"Fiona, what’s going on?"

I forced a smile to reassure him.

"It’s nothing. I’ll tell you in a bit. How’s your injury?"

Guilt weighed on me as I lowered my head.

"I promised to visit sooner, but things got complicated."

Ethan waved it off casually and gave my shoulder a light, playful pat.

"Don’t worry about it. Just tell me everything that’s happened—no hiding anything!"

I took a deep breath and, under his expectant gaze, recounted the events of the past few days in a calm tone.

His face twisted in outrage. "What? All this happened while I was gone? That Ryan Lowell is absolute scum!"

Shock and sympathy filled his eyes as he looked at me.

"Fiona, you didn’t deserve any of this. I’ll make sure justice is served!"

My lips twitched, my mood sinking to its lowest point.

"It’s no use, Ethan. I went to see Principal Lowell today—they’re in this together." My chest tightened painfully, suffocating me.

"We can’t win against him."

Ethan’s expression hardened, his eyes burning with stubborn defiance.

Suppressing his fury, he let out a bitter laugh. "Let’s see how long they can keep laughing. This is outright lawlessness!"

I clenched my fists, trying to suppress the anguish, but it surged like a relentless tide.

Ethan’s face flushed red before he pulled out his phone and dialed a number.

"Hey, Dad. There’s something you need to know."

"That substitute instructor, Ryan Lowell—he’s been groping female students under the guise of correcting their form. He even tried to assault one!"

I stared at him, my heart in my throat.

"I’m sure. She’s my close friend, and she’s right here with me. She told me everything herself."

He gave me a reassuring look before continuing. "This is ruining our institution’s reputation. We can’t let this slide!"

His voice was sharp, as if he wanted to tear Ryan apart right then.

Soon, he finally hung up.

"Sorry I never mentioned it before. Principal Roland is my father."

So he had been talking to the principal.

My heart pounded violently at his words. My hands clenched together, knuckles whitening, my emotions overwhelming.

"He promised a full investigation. Don’t worry—I’ll make sure every wrong against you is made right."

Tremors ran through me, every nerve alight. My heart drummed like a battle cry, blood burning with adrenaline.

"Thank you, Ethan. If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have known what to do. You gave me hope."

He shook his head firmly, eyes glinting.

"The person you should thank is yourself."

"You overcame your fear and spoke up. You fought for justice with your own strength. Even without me, you would’ve found a way to tell the principal."

His praise warmed my cheeks, filling me with indescribable relief.

"Either way, he’ll get what he deserves. That’s all that matters now."

Under Principal Roland’s swift investigation, Ryan was charged with attempted assault of a minor. Security footage sealed his fate, and he was handed over to the police.

Vice Principal Lowell, who had repeatedly covered for Ryan and even participated in his crimes, was suspended pending further review.

The two biggest threats were finally gone.
