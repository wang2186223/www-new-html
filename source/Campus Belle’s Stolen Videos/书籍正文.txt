###Chapter 1
My name is Vivian Laurent, and I'm an English teacher.

That afternoon, I was practicing yoga at home when I received a call from the department head. The newly hired teacher had arrived, and I needed to handle the handover.

Not wanting to keep them waiting, I didn’t even shower. I rushed over in just a camisole and yoga pants.

But I never expected the new English teacher to be a towering Black man.

"Hello, I'm Reginald Valentine. You're stunning," he greeted me in broken Mandarin while shaking my hand.

"Thank you," I replied, subtly withdrawing my hand and discreetly sizing him up.

Tall. Muscular. That was my first impression.

Perhaps because of my ample chest, Reginald’s gaze lingered shamelessly on the exposed curve of my cleavage and the intimate contours hugged by my yoga pants.

It made me uncomfortable.

Though I was used to being ogled by men, I disliked such blatant stares.

After collecting the materials from the department head, I led Reginald to the apartment arranged for him while giving a brief campus tour.

"Ms. Laurent, someone as beautiful as you must have a boyfriend," he remarked as we walked closer.

"I'm married."

For some reason, Reginald seemed even more excited upon hearing that.

"Then he must be fucking you every night?"

"That’s too personal. I won’t answer."

Irritation prickled under my skin.

Truthfully, since my husband had been away on business, I hadn’t experienced that mind-blowing pleasure in a long time.

"If I were your husband, I’d take you every single day."

"How—how dare you speak so crudely?"

His vulgar words made my legs weaken mid-step on the staircase. I stumbled, nearly falling.

Luckily, Reginald—who had been shamelessly eyeing my backside—caught me just in time.

"Careful," he murmured.

Effortlessly, he pulled me into his arms, one hand gripping my bare waist while the other slid between my thighs. With a firm lift, he hoisted me face-down against his chest.

"Ah—! Y-you—!"

A shocking jolt of pleasure surged through me, drawing a sharp gasp. My toes curled, legs instinctively clamping around his thick wrist.

Reginald showed no intention of letting go. "You’re exhausted, Ms. Laurent. Let me carry you upstairs."

With that, he ascended the steps, fingers teasingly working against me.

"Nnh—stop… don’t—don’t touch me there—!"

My ovulation period was still days away—the peak of my desire.

I couldn’t withstand this torment.

Electric shivers wracked my body, thighs trembling uncontrollably.

"Ah—no… I can’t—let me go—!"
###Chapter 2

I had no idea how much time had passed when Reginald finally set me down. Only then did I realize we had reached the third floor, right outside the apartment door.

"Ms. Laurent, who knew you'd be this sensitive? Want to try my—"

"Wh-what?"

Before I could react, Reginald's hand was already groping my backside again.

A shiver ran through me. I tried to push him away, but he grabbed my wrist and yanked me closer. Then, a sudden warmth pressed against my palm.

This texture...

He had shoved my hand straight into his pants!

"Ah... it's... huge..."

The words slipped out before I could stop myself, my fingers instinctively curling around him.

The moment I realized what I was doing, I jerked my hand back, my face burning.

"If you... keep this up... I'll call the police..."

My hands trembled as I fumbled for the apartment key in my document bag.

All I wanted was to finish this job and get as far away from him as possible.

Otherwise, I wasn't sure I could control myself.

But what happened next was beyond anything I could have imagined.

The second the door swung open, a thick, musky scent hit me. The sight that followed exploded in my vision like gunpowder—a man and woman tangled together in the living room.

From where I stood, I could see a slender, naked woman with milky-white skin pinned beneath a towering, muscular Black man on the couch. He was thrusting into her like a wild bull.

"Ah... yes... ruin me..."

The woman trembled violently, her moans bordering on sobs.

I clapped a hand over my mouth, staring in disbelief.

That woman was my colleague—my best friend, Jessica.

"Hey, man, at least take it to the bedroom..."

Reginald strode forward, exchanging a fist bump with the other man before turning to me. "This is my brother, Martin."

"Heh, couldn't wait to enjoy this sweet body..."

My face burned from the obscene display. I deliberately avoided looking at Martin's naked form, quickly scooping up Jessica's dress from the floor and draping it over her.

"What the hell is going on?" I demanded.

She had a boyfriend, for God's sake.

How could she sneak around with another man—let alone a stranger—without fear of getting caught?

Jessica clung to my arm, shaking it frantically. "Oh my God, Vivian, you actually showed up!"

Before I could process her words, a sharp ringtone cut through the air.

Her boyfriend was video-calling to check on her.

As it turned out, Jessica had gotten a call over ten minutes ago. Her boyfriend had noticed something off in her voice and demanded an explanation.

In a panic, she lied and said she was with me—that I was just in the bathroom.

She'd been ready to face the consequences, but my timely arrival gave her the perfect alibi.

After ending the call, Jessica begged me to stay the night. Her boyfriend would undoubtedly check again, and if the background changed, she'd be exposed.

Watching her carefree grin, I hesitated but ultimately agreed.

"After all, I can't just let my best friend get dumped, can I?"

That night, as I stood under the shower, the thought crossed my mind.

Yet my face burned, prickling with heat as if on fire. I deliberately avoided acknowledging that staying wasn't strictly necessary.

Worse, my mind kept replaying the image of Jessica tangled with that man—and the outrageous sensation of Reginald forcing my hand against him in the hallway.

Maybe it had been too long since I'd been satisfied, but in that moment, I'd even fantasized about sleeping with him.

The thought horrified me. I pressed my hands to my scorching cheeks.

No. This had to stop. If this continued, something terrible would happen.

"Forget it, forget it all..."

I chanted inwardly, forcing myself to focus on the water cascading over me instead of that man's body.

Just then, Jessica sidled up to me with a sly look. "Vivian... did you get a good look earlier?"

I swallowed hard. "At what?"

Instead of answering, she dug through her clothes and pulled out her phone, playing a video.
###Chapter 3 

showed her kneeling between Reginald's legs, looking up while preparing him.

I swallowed hard. "You... you actually recorded videos?"

"Several of them..."

She switched to another video without hesitation.

This angle was shot from above, clearly showing Reginald holding Jessica's phone, capturing every intimate detail of her body in sharp clarity.

But the most visually striking part was Reginald's almost inhuman physique—especially the stark contrast between his flushed arousal and dark skin, sending an electric tingle down my spine.

I bit my lip. "Isn't that... too much? How did you handle it?"

"It hurt at first, but then it felt so... full. So good. So good you'd be willing to die the next second."

Jessica grew more animated, her face flushed with intoxication. "Want to try? Tonight, all four of us... It'll be wild."

"You're... serious?"

My legs trembled, my words stumbling. "It's been so long for me... And what if my husband finds out—"

"Who's going to tell him?"

Seeing my hesitation, Jessica grinned and playfully squeezed my chest. "Come on, bestie. Tonight, we'll show them that the plow never breaks—only the ox tires out!"

With that, she carelessly toweled off and strode out of the bathroom, still naked.

Minutes later, the door reopened.

She stood there with two towering, fully nude Black men.

Grinning wickedly, Jessica pushed me into Reginald's arms. "Bestie, let me introduce you to the joy of double penetration..."

The moment his testosterone-charged body touched mine, I shuddered.

Even though I'd braced myself, the reality left me weak.

Shame tangled with a strange thrill, an unbearable itch pulsing between my thighs.

But soon, the itch vanished.

Because Reginald effortlessly lifted me from behind, spreading my legs like a child being held over a toilet, pressing me against Martin's waist.

They moved in practiced unison—clearly not their first time sharing a woman.
###Chapter 4

To be honest, I’m no saint, but I’m not some naive virgin either.

Everything I’ve done has always been on my own terms.

But what happened today—first Reginald’s teasing words, then the intense scene between Jessica and Martin, and finally being sandwiched between them—was too much.

It was all too fast. I had no time to mentally prepare, and I couldn’t handle it.

I grabbed the fruit knife from the coffee table and pressed it to my throat. "Stop right now, or I’ll kill myself!"

Reginald froze in shock.

Jessica, still naked, lunged at me. "Vivian, what are you doing? Don’t be stupid!"

Truthfully, I didn’t even know why I did it. I just didn’t want to be looked down on by these foreign men.

Reginald and Martin, seemingly afraid things would escalate, pulled on their shorts and silently retreated to the bedroom.

Relieved, I dropped the knife.

Once they were gone, Jessica leaned in close, whispering, "Since when did you become such a prude? Since when do you turn down a man like that?"

Still shaken, I felt too drained to respond.

Instead, I shot back, "What about you? I thought you were with Jason—" I cut myself off, suddenly paranoid about being overheard.

Too exhausted to think straight, I dragged myself out of bed, locked the door securely, and then asked, "What happened with Jason? Why are you with Martin now?"

Jessica’s face darkened.

She and Jason had been college sweethearts, together for nearly two years.

But recently, he’d seen her having dinner with a coworker and accused her of cheating.

They’d fought bitterly, and things ended badly.

Then she’d run into Martin on campus.

Martin was smooth-talking, and within minutes, he had her smiling again.

One thing led to another, and before she knew it, she was in his bed.

I smacked her thigh. "You’re going to get yourself killed."

Jessica just laughed and pushed me down, grinning. "That’s why I need my best friend to share the fun."

My stomach twisted. After a pause, I asked quietly, "What do you really think of them?"

Jessica shrugged. "Who cares? It’s just fun. It’s not like we’re getting married."

Her carefree smile made my chest ache.

Honestly, I’d never had a good impression of men like them.

The kind who think with their lower half, who treat women like conquests—I’d always kept my distance.

But then again, Reginald had backed off without argument. No excuses, no pressure.

Maybe I’d misjudged them.

But if I was wrong, how was I supposed to face them tomorrow?

Exhausted and conflicted, I finally drifted off.

The next morning, I woke naturally to sunlight streaming through the curtains.

It was past ten.

Jessica was still asleep beside me, and no one had knocked on the door.

After a long hesitation, I finally worked up the courage to unlock it.

The door creaked open, and sunlight flooded in.

On the dining table was a spread of breakfast dishes—toast, sandwiches, two steaming mugs of milk.

I stood frozen in surprise.

Footsteps approached, and a tall figure appeared.

Reginald.

He wore an apron, wiping his hands casually as he smiled. "You’re awake."

He acted as if last night’s awkwardness had never happened. I nodded stiffly.

"I made breakfast," he said warmly. "Hope you like it."

I sat at the table, eyeing the food. It actually looked good.

"Consider it an apology for last night."

My face burned at the reminder. I avoided his gaze.

Reginald sat across from me, his expression serious. "I’m sorry. I was out of line. I just… really like you."

The air between us was thick with tension. I wanted to leave immediately.

But Jessica refused to go, dragging me into staying.

Reginald and Martin, both full of restless energy, often wandered around shirtless in the summer heat.

The raw masculinity was overwhelming. I slept clutching the blankets every night.

Jessica, on the other hand, was having the time of her life, glued to Martin like a second skin.

And Reginald’s gaze grew bolder by the day.

Then, finally, he showed his true colors.
###Chapter 5

I was in the middle of showering when the water suddenly cut off, my hair still full of unrinsed shampoo.

"Jessica? Jessica?" I called out, but there was no response. Normally, she would answer immediately.

After several unanswered calls, I began to suspect something was wrong. Cautiously, I wrapped a towel tightly around my chest and secured it with a firm knot.

Sure enough, a tall figure appeared outside the bathroom door. "Vivian, what's wrong?"

My heart sank—it was Reginald. "Can you get Jessica for me?"

"Jessica's busy. I can help you instead," he said, already pushing against the door as if to enter.

I rushed to lock the door, but I was too slow. Before I could reach it, the door swung open from the outside.

Reginald's eyes immediately roamed over my body, his gaze lingering shamelessly. When he noticed the towel still covering me, his expression darkened with disappointment, his brow furrowing in displeasure.

The way he looked at me made my skin crawl.

Suppressing my disgust, I tried to shoo him away. "It's fine, just leave—" But in my nervousness, my foot slipped, and I nearly fell backward.

Reginald lunged forward, his large hand gripping my waist to steady me. The heat of his touch burned against my skin.

Panicked, I shoved at his chest and swallowed hard. "Thanks. Now go."

Before I could finish, he tightened his grip and leaned in, his breath hot against my ear. "Stop pretending to be innocent. Jessica told me all about your wild side."

His words sent a shiver down my spine.

Cursing Jessica silently, I forced a calm tone and raised my voice. "You've got the wrong idea. I'm not that kind of woman, and I'm married!"

I clutched the towel desperately, refusing to give him an opening. Unlike Jessica, I wasn't nearly so bold.

We stared each other down for what felt like an eternity before Reginald finally relented, releasing me with a dark look before stalking out of the room.

One night, Jason unexpectedly video-called Jessica. Unfortunately, his timing couldn't have been worse—Jessica was in bed with Martin at that very moment.

To my shock, Jessica, whether for the thrill or some other reason, actually answered the call with trembling fingers.

"Where are you?" Jason asked.

The bedroom door was wide open, giving me a clear view from across the hall. My stomach twisted with secondhand dread.

Jessica had the audacity to say, "I'm with Vivian."

Jason wasn't stupid. He noticed something off in her expression and demanded, "Oh? Then let me talk to Vivian."

Hearing my name, I rushed over to intervene, grabbing the phone. "Jason, Jessica and I were just about to go to sleep—"

But in my haste, my hand slipped, accidentally revealing Martin in the background.
###Chapter 6

Jason wasn't blind. Once he caught a suspicious detail, he wouldn’t let it go. "Why do I see a man there? What are you two doing?"

My mind raced for excuses, but that fleeting black figure was impossible to explain away.

I stammered for a while as Jason kept pressing aggressively. In desperation, I ended the video call.

Staring at the darkened screen, my heart pounded. I tossed the phone to her.

She created this mess—let her clean it up.

As expected, Jessica and Jason had a huge fight afterward, and their year-and-a-half-long relationship officially ended. Jessica completely let loose, openly flirting with Martin on campus, holding hands and clinging to him without a care.

I thought that would be the end of it, but then a rumor about us started spreading on the school forum.

Whispers circulated that Jessica and I had been fooling around with two Black men, shaming our reputation.

In their words, we were shameless women.

"This is definitely Jason’s revenge!" Jessica fumed when she heard the rumors, convinced he was behind it.

Remembering Jason’s furious face during that video call, I wasn’t so sure. "But we have no proof."

The priority now was to stop the rumor from spreading further. Jessica needed to tone it down.

"You two should lay low. If people see you, the gossip will only get worse."

But Jessica frowned, clearly reluctant.

I hesitantly asked, "Are you two together now?"

She squirmed. "No. I just can’t give up his skills in bed."

Jessica, all beauty and no brains, had no idea how damaging this was to a woman’s reputation. I sighed in exasperation. "Break it off. It’s bad if people see you."

The next day, I confronted Jason. "Did you spread those rumors on the forum?"

He looked genuinely confused, as if he had no idea what I was talking about.

After a pause, he smirked mockingly. "I wouldn’t waste my time on that. If you did it, why be afraid of people talking?"

His words infuriated me. "Watch your mouth! I didn’t do anything!"

Jason shrugged. "I don’t care about you. All I know is that bitch is a slut."

Thankfully, Jessica didn’t hear that, or another fight would’ve erupted.

But his words made me realize—he might not be behind this after all.

His grudge was only with Jessica. He had no reason to drag me into it.

Which meant… whoever did this probably had a problem with me.

Faces flashed through my mind as I searched for suspects, finally landing on one person.

After much hesitation, I decided to investigate the forum.

The school’s forum admin could trace the IP address of the rumor’s originator.

Without solid evidence, no one could be accused outright.

After some digging, we found the forum’s administrator.

But we hit a wall—they refused to disclose user information.

Luckily, Jessica stepped in with a honey trap and convinced them to help.

"According to the IP address, the poster was in the foreign teachers’ apartment building."

My suspicions were confirmed, sending a chill down my spine.

It was Reginald and Martin.
###Chapter 7
Jessica and I exchanged glances, our hearts heavy as if weighed down by a hydraulic jack.

I let out a cold snort. "Now you see what kind of scum they really are."

Jessica lowered her head guiltily, remaining silent.

I clenched my fists tightly, a reckless idea surging through my mind.

I wanted revenge—to make them pay for spreading those rumors about us.

But just an IP address wasn’t enough. We needed more concrete evidence.

Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed the IT specialist staring at Jessica with infatuation.

It hit me—he was the one who single-handedly managed the school’s forum. Maybe he could help.

After a moment’s thought, I turned to him for assistance.

"Hey, handsome, is there any way to hack into someone’s phone and extract their data?"

Jessica played along, tugging at his sleeve and batting her lashes, completely bewitching the tech geek.

After some consideration, he handed us a link.

"It looks like a normal link, but it’s actually malware. Once it infiltrates a phone’s system, it can monitor and extract all the data stored inside."

With this virus, we could easily break into their phones. The evidence would be ours in no time.

As we left, the IT specialist eagerly added, "Feel free to come to me anytime if you need more help."

I couldn’t help but give Jessica a thumbs-up.

Sometimes, a little charm really did save unnecessary trouble.

Since I no longer had any contact with Reginald, planting the virus would have to be Jessica’s task.

She was still pretending to be inseparable from Martin, so getting her hands on his phone wouldn’t be difficult.

I waited anxiously for Jessica’s update, my palms slick with sweat.

Finally, my phone buzzed with a notification, sending my heart racing.

With trembling fingers, I opened the compressed file she sent.

Inside were countless files—gigabytes of photos from their phones and an endless collection of sex tapes.

A quick skim revealed five different women in the footage, some of whom I recognized.

A chill ran down my spine.

They had recorded themselves sleeping with other women.

Was this their way of controlling those unsuspecting girls?

The next set of images—screenshots from their chat logs—answered my question.

Reginald: Check this one out. Prime catch, huh?
Martin: You’re not keeping her all to yourself, are you?
Reginald: Back off. Didn’t I let you have the last one? This one’s mine.
Martin: I’m getting bored with mine already.
Reginald: Fine, fine. Once I’m done, you can have her for a few days.
Martin: Deal!

I glanced at the date—it was the first day I had been quarantined at home.

Turns out, from the very beginning, they had already treated me like an object to be traded.
###Chapter 8
My heart sank as I continued reading.

Martin: Still no luck?

Reginald: Nope. She won't let me touch her. No idea what she’s playing at.

Martin: Such a hypocritical slut. Pathetic. Mine’s way more obedient.

Reginald: It’s driving me crazy not getting a taste. Let me have yours sometime.

Martin: Sure thing.

I frowned at the screen.

Jessica was being passed around like some toy?

Martin: Quarantine’s almost over. Are we just letting her off the hook?

Reginald: No way. She needs to learn her lesson. These girls care so much about their reputations. Slap the "slut" label on her, and she’ll be putty in our hands.

Martin: Brilliant!

The chat logs ended there, leaving my blood boiling.

So Reginald had been holding a grudge because I refused to sleep with him. Now he and Martin were plotting to ruin both Jessica’s and my reputations, making us easy prey.

At that moment, I felt nothing but relief for standing my ground.

As for those two pieces of scum—they wouldn’t get away with this. They’d pay for what they’d done.

I compiled every shred of evidence into a folder and sent it to the university’s official complaint email, attaching my real name. In the message, I stressed the urgency of the matter, warning that I’d go to the police if the school failed to act.

At the same time, I turned their own tactics against them. I posted the entire exposé on the campus forum.

The impact was immediate.

The thread exploded. Thousands of comments piled up, every single one condemning the two men.

Public opinion flipped overnight. The same netizens who’d previously slut-shamed us now led the charge in tearing Martin and Reginald apart.

The outrage went viral, trending within hours.

The school, desperate to contain the fallout, launched a full investigation.

After verifying every allegation, they acted swiftly.

By that evening, an official notice announced Reginald and Martin’s expulsion.

In the aftermath, my inbox flooded with heartfelt support.

Those kind, empowering messages carried me through many sleepless nights.

I’d considered anonymity—sparing myself the backlash.

But in the end, I chose to put my name on it.
