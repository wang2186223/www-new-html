###Chapter 1

My best friend's boyfriend is a personal trainer with a sculpted physique and raw masculine energy.

After a fight with my husband, I stayed at her place. Every time I turned around, I witnessed their intimate moments.

Feeling neglected, I couldn't resist. When she was away, I invited him into the shower.


My name is Jasmine Anderson, and I teach ballet.

Thanks to my high estrogen levels, I’ve always had a strong libido.

Unless it was that time of the month, I’d spend every night with my husband…

But recently, after a fight, I moved out of our home and into my best friend Sophia Langley’s place.

I thought he’d come crawling back in a couple of days.

Instead, he ignored me for over two weeks.

My anger hadn’t faded, but my body’s needs didn’t care.

Too stubborn to give in, I secretly took care of myself every night at Sophia’s.

That day, I was in the bathroom, lost in the moment, when the front door suddenly swung open.

Startled, I thought Sophia had come home early.

I needed to finish fast.

Then came a long, breathy moan from the living room. “W-Wait… What if Jasmine’s here?”

“She’s not. The living room and bedrooms are empty.”

I held my breath. It was Sophia and her boyfriend, Derek Hill—a personal trainer with a body that could make any woman weak.

Every time I saw him, I’d go home and demand more from my husband.

Then I’d imagine what it’d feel like under Derek’s sculpted muscles.

Sophia hesitated, calling my name a few times.

I almost answered.

But something made me stay quiet.

After days of self-satisfaction, I was bored. A live erotic show sounded tempting.

Hearing no response, Sophia relaxed. The wet sounds of kissing and muffled moans filled the air.

Soon, the living room echoed with heated gasps and skin slapping against skin.

I pressed my ear closer.

Then Derek paused. “What’s this? Your panties?”

Sophia’s voice was thick with pleasure. “Not mine… Must be Jasmine’s…”

“Ah—”

The second the words left her lips, Sophia let out a helpless, trembling cry.

She slapped Derek’s chest playfully. “Just mentioning her gets you this excited? You’ve wanted her for a while, haven’t you?”

“She’s a ballet dancer. That tiny waist, that elegance—what man wouldn’t?” Derek answered shamelessly.

My face burned in the bathroom.

I never thought they’d talk about me while doing that.

Just like how I fantasized about Derek when I was with my husband.

Leaning against the wall, I listened to Sophia’s broken moans, Derek’s powerful body flashing in my mind.

The desire I’d suppressed earlier flared back to life.

My legs trembled. My fingers slid between my thighs.
###Chapter 2

I imagined Derek’s toned physique, pictured Sophia’s flushed, satisfied face outside the door.

I imagined it was me pinned beneath him…

My heart lurched, and I yanked my hand away. How could I think like that? He was Sophia’s boyfriend.

In the past, I’d indulged in fantasies because I knew it was my husband on top of me—those thoughts just added spice.

But now, Derek was right outside, real and breathing.

Guilt gnawed at me, betraying both my husband and Sophia. Yet, as her moans grew louder, my body tensed with need.

Covering my face in shame, I squeezed my thighs together in the bathroom, only snapping back to reality when Sophia let out a sharp cry.

Trembling, I sank onto the toilet, water splashing onto the floor.

I curled up, humiliated, but between my legs, the phantom pulses of my fantasy lingered.

"Enjoy yourself?" Sophia panted. "Using Jasmine’s panties while you fucked me—you’re disgusting."

Derek chuckled. "I’ll toss them in the hamper. Just tell her you did it."

Still in the bathroom, I barely processed their words before Derek’s footsteps approached.

"Huh? Why’s the light on?"

Panic shot through me. I opened my mouth to stop him—

Too late. The door swung open.

The mirror reflected my state: cheeks flushed, curves on full display, my loose shirt pushed up to my collarbones from earlier.

I was completely exposed.

Derek froze in the doorway, his own arousal visibly stirring beneath his undone pants.

I clamped a hand over my mouth.

Frantically, I grabbed for my clothes.

But that split-second image must’ve seared into his mind.

His gaze burned through me, as if he could still see everything.

I bit my lip, then glanced down—

His thick length nearly brushed my nose.

God, it’s huge.
###Chapter 3

I gasped, inhaling the thick scent of masculine hormones that seemed to send a signal straight to my body.

My limbs trembled uncontrollably, as if electric currents were shooting through my thighs.

"Why are the lights on? Is Jasmine home?" Sophia's weak voice drifted from the living room, her footsteps approaching.

Panic flashed across our faces. Derek stepped forward, shutting the door behind him.

"No, she's not. Probably forgot to turn them off."

"Oh? Why are you closing the door?"

"I need to use the bathroom."

Derek fended off Sophia's questioning, then shot me a glance. What was he looking at me for?

Flustered, I stared back in confusion—was he expecting me to pee right now?

He kept signaling with his eyes.

Sophia sounded skeptical outside. "Using the bathroom?"

As her footsteps drew nearer, I finally gave in to shame, covering my face like a child hiding from reality.

The sound of running water filled the bathroom.

Sophia paused at the door. Derek coughed awkwardly. "I'm peeing. Want to come in and check?"

She hesitated, then turned away. "Hurry up and get dressed when you're done. It'd be so awkward if Jasmine came back."

I don’t remember how the rest of that day passed.

Only that after Derek left, I stayed in the bathroom for a long time, gathering myself before sneaking back to my room.

But when I opened the door, Sophia stood there, arms crossed.

"So you were really in there..."

My heart lurched. Before I could explain, she waved me off. "I don’t mind. If I did, I’d have broken up with him the moment he said he was into you. What surprises me is that you stayed quiet."

Biting my lower lip in shame, I followed her gaze to the wet spot on the floor. Understanding flashed in her eyes.

Then she leaned in conspiratorially. "As your bestie, if you can’t hold out these next few days… I’ll lend you Derek?"

Her teasing made me relax instantly. I shoved her away. "Get lost! Since when are men borrowable?!"

Flushing crimson, I pushed past her and fled to my room.

I thought that would be the end of it.

But to my shock, after Sophia joked about "lending" Derek to me, my mind spiraled with fantasies of his body—how he’d driven her wild in the living room, the sheer size I’d glimpsed in the bathroom.

So much bigger than my husband. What would it feel like inside me?

In bed, I clenched my thighs, scalp burning. Closing my eyes, I saw Derek’s silhouette taunting me. Even my breaths carried traces of his lingering musk.

I couldn’t take it anymore.

Exhausting myself with advanced ballet poses, I collapsed into sleep—only to dream of Derek bending me into a split position, taking me ruthlessly.

Even after one round, he wasn’t satisfied. Flipping me over, he tore my leotard, yanking my hips down until my rear arched high for his next assault.

I woke at dawn, trembling, soaked through my panties and sheets.

Gulping, I squeezed the blanket between my legs, chasing the phantom pleasure of my dream.

But even fantasizing about my husband left me hollow.

Morning came.

I dragged myself out of bed, drained.

While brushing my teeth, Sophia sidled up, half-complaining, half-boasting:

"Jasmine, Derek’s insane." She pointed to her lips. "See how swollen I am? How am I supposed to explain this at work?"

"But if I don’t let him, he’ll wreck me. It’s exhausting!"

Her faux complaints made me burn with envy. I sucked in a sharp breath, my tongue flicking the toothbrush bristles.

The mint did nothing to cool the fire inside.

If anything, the bristles’ scrape only stoked it.

Over the next few days—whether by Sophia’s design or Derek’s—he visited almost nightly.

Their marathon sessions kept me awake.

At first, it was just noise disrupting my sleep. But after accidentally passing their ajar door post-bathroom, my mind replayed the image of Sophia sprawled on the bed, eyes rolled back, lips trembling like she was high.

Alone in bed, I curled up listening to their symphony.

I considered calling my husband—apologizing, begging to return.

Yet in the two weeks since I left, he’d been living it up—bar-hopping with friends, ignoring my calls. My plans to reconcile kept postponing.

Tonight, Sophia and Derek started again.

But something was different.

Sophia’s moans crescendoed—sweet, sinful, euphoric.

My imagination ran wild. What positions were they trying?

That familiar pretty face, tongue lolling, eyes white.

She couldn’t know half the poses I did.

Clutching the blanket, I arched my hips, fantasizing about a powerful man behind me.

But my fingers were a poor substitute.

I craved the real thing—anyone, as long as they matched Derek’s… endowments.

As if heaven heard my plea, a loud thud came from next door. Bare feet slapped the floor as Sophia scrambled out, bursting into my room.

"Save me! Jasmine, help! He’s killing me!"

Her eyes glazed with lust and fear, she collapsed onto me.

I shrieked, trying to squirm free.

If anyone saw me in this position—

Why hadn’t I locked the door?

Too late. Sophia trembled atop me, her curves pressing through my thin nightgown.

Then I saw him—Derek filling the doorway, that monstrous sway between his legs.

Sophia shuddered in ecstasy. My emptiness peaked.

I stopped resisting.

Parting my thighs, I let her roll aside—and took her place.
###Chapter 4

Just as Derek Hill spread his large hands over my thighs, I suddenly realized something was wrong.

I couldn’t quite put my finger on it.

But the events of the past few days felt strange, as if some unseen force was pushing everything forward.

I immediately called for a stop, trying to get Sophia to pause.

But Sophia ignored me, her hands gripping my arms tightly as she pinned me down with her body, her knee pressing against my thigh to keep me from closing my legs.

"Hey! Stop! Derek, get your hands off me! If you don’t stop, I’m calling the police!"

"Sophia, get off me!"

I shouted, but Sophia’s sobs drowned out my voice. I could barely hear myself.

Derek didn’t care, and with Sophia holding me down, I was trapped.

Just as his fingers were about to brush against my most intimate place—

"Sweetheart! Your darling hubby is here—!"

My husband’s booming, cheerful voice rang out from beside us, startling all three of us in the room.

Sophia flinched violently.

The charged atmosphere shattered instantly.

I quickly pushed Sophia away and grabbed my phone. This was the custom ringtone my goofy husband had recorded for his calls—wherever I went, whenever he called, everyone around could hear his silly but affectionate greeting.

I used to find it sweet. Today, it saved me.

I scrambled up and answered the call.

But as I glanced down, I saw—

Under the pale moonlight, Sophia’s smooth skin was marred with bruises, dark and mottled.

My expression hardened. My husband’s cheerful voice came through the phone:

"Heard you missed me?"

"Who told you that?"

"Doesn’t matter who told me. If you miss me, I’ll come pick you up right now?"

His voice was smug. The two weeks I’d been away had probably felt like a vacation to him. Now that he’d had his fun, he remembered me?

I opened my mouth to agree, but Sophia shrank against me fearfully.

I looked up and saw Derek still standing nearby.

That thing of his was still swaying, his gaze fixed on Sophia’s pert backside.

In the moonlight, Sophia’s most intimate area wasn’t just flushed—it was swollen. Her body was covered in bruises, especially in hidden places beneath her clothes.

These weren’t marks left from pleasure or rough play.

They looked like deliberate, malicious abuse.

I shot Derek a sharp glare and told him to get out.

But he hesitated, lifting his foot as if to step closer again.

I’d trained in ballet for over a decade and had spent years as a teacher. My presence wasn’t just for show.

Plus, I was still on the phone with my husband.

Seeing my stern expression, Derek lowered his foot and retreated. Sophia let out a quiet sob.

"Huh? What was that?" My husband heard it too. "Was that crying? Jasmine, are you watching something? I’m coming over right now!"

His playful tone vanished, replaced by concern.

I refused. "No, it’s just Sophia and her boyfriend had a fight. I’m comforting her. It’s late—don’t come over tonight. I’ll text you in the morning."

Then I glanced at Derek, who was still watching us like a predator. "Actually, if you’re not tired, stay awake tonight. Be ready for my call."

Hearing my serious tone, my husband gave a firm "Mm."

Then he added, "I’m already downstairs at your friend’s place. If anything happens, put me on speaker or call me. I’ll be up in seconds."

I was surprised he was already here. That uneasy feeling grew stronger.

But I couldn’t piece it together yet.

Still, knowing he was nearby made me feel safer.

I turned on speakerphone so Derek could hear—my husband was downstairs. If he tried anything else, my husband would storm up immediately.

My husband might not be as muscular as Derek, but he’d been on the university basketball team—six-foot-one and broad-shouldered.

Against Derek, who was maybe five-foot-nine at best, the outcome wasn’t certain.

And in the time it took for a fight, Sophia and I could call the police.

Hearing my husband was downstairs, Derek finally backed off with a resentful glare and retreated to Sophia’s room.
###Chapter 5

The room fell silent again as I held my trembling best friend Sophia in my arms.

Gently stroking her hair, I whispered, "It's okay now. Don't be afraid..."

Her body was covered with bruises large and small. My heart ached seeing them, yet I dared not touch the wounds.

"What happened? Tell me everything." I asked when she calmed down slightly.

Sophia remained silent at first, but after my persistent questioning, she finally confessed.

Just as I suspected - Derek had abusive tendencies.

"He works as a personal trainer. Whenever he fails to meet quotas at work, he takes it out on me - hitting me, choking me!" Fresh tears welled up in Sophia's eyes.

"Before you came, he would push me onto the balcony naked and abuse me in front of the floor-to-ceiling windows! These past two days with you here, he didn't dare be so brazen."

Frowning deeply, I couldn't help asking why she never called the police!

Or at least break up with him!

Why keep such trash around?

Was she being threatened?

My gaze turned icy.

Then Sophia lifted her innocent face and said, "But he's good to me."

Good to you despite the abuse?!

Seeing my disbelief, she lowered her head to explain. "It's true he hits me, but it's also true he treats me well."

"He cooks delicious meals for me, buys me skewers after work, gets me flowers when we go shopping..."

"And he's really amazing in bed. I enjoy most of it - it's just the final part I can't handle..."

"Also he likes using his hands during sex, but all men have their little quirks, right?"

As Sophia spoke, she seemed lost in memories, making excuses for Derek with a blissful smile.

A chill ran down my spine.

I never realized my best friend was this love-struck. Even after being abused, she still romanticized her boyfriend.

Noticing my discomfort, Sophia gave an awkward laugh. "Childhood neglect issues, haha..."

Then she hugged my waist pleadingly. "Jasmine, could you stay a few more days? Please? He doesn't dare go too far when you're around."

"Just give me a little vacation, let me rest for once?"

Now she wasn't condemning Derek's abuse at all, just begging me to stay.

Looking at her bruised body, then at her childishly pleading expression, I sighed and agreed.

"Yay!" Sophia tackled me onto the bed, rolling around giddily like a kid.

But in the quiet moments, I could smell the blood from her wounds.

My feelings were complicated.

After a while, she suddenly jumped up. "Oh! I need to go apologize to Derek."

You're apologizing to HIM?

Seeing my disbelief, she explained, "I ran away before he finished. He must be frustrated now."

"I'll say sorry, then we can sleep together tonight!"

Before I could respond, she dashed back to the adjacent room, leaving me in silence.

Our promised sleepover never happened.

She didn't return. Soon, muffled moans came through the walls again.

She never learned - probably getting abused while rolling her eyes in pleasure.

Though she tried suppressing the sounds, her pain still seeped into my heart.

All my previous arousal had vanished.

Next morning, Sophia and Derek were already gone when I woke up.

I went downstairs to greet my husband.

At work, my unease grew until I called my husband to investigate Derek.

Fortunately, my husband came from wealth and connections. Within hours, he had information.

He rushed to meet me immediately.

"What's so urgent? And I'm still mad at you!" I glared from the passenger seat as he drove.

"Forget our issues. You need to come home instead of staying with Sophia." He avoided eye contact, seeming troubled.

"Put our problems aside. What did you find about her boyfriend?"

He frowned. "Just come home first. I'll show you something."

His mysterious manner deepened my suspicion.

Back home, he entered a website - and there was Sophia's photo!
###Chapter 6

The photos showed Sophia in seductive lingerie, her flawless skin and perfect figure fully exposed to the camera. Some shots even appeared accidental, as if she hadn’t noticed being photographed.

My eyes widened in shock.

My husband cleared his throat awkwardly beside me. "I was stunned too when I first saw them. But there’s more. Do you want to keep looking?"

I nodded. With a few taps from him, the screen switched to a paywall—one dollar for access.

The page refreshed, revealing rows of video thumbnails. Each clip offered a three-second preview, showcasing Sophia in various outfits and settings—on a bed, in a living room, deep in the woods, even in a high-slit cheongsam. Though her face was blurred, anyone who knew her would recognize her instantly.

Unlocking the full videos cost 88 dollars.

My breath hitched as I scrolled through the endless list. At the very bottom, an option read: Customize Your Experience—198 dollars for specific locations, outfits, or camera angles. Choices included rooftops, dressing rooms…

For a moment, my mind went blank before clarity struck. Does Sophia know about these?

The videos were all blurred, hiding her expressions. Most seemed secretly recorded. If Derek had uploaded these without her consent… I grabbed my phone to call the police.

My husband stopped me. "Wait."

I turned to him, confused. He hesitated before speaking. "I think… she might be doing this willingly. This page doesn’t just sell videos. There’s also lingerie, stockings… used ones. If Derek’s been running this for a while, there’s no way she doesn’t know."

A cold weight settled in my chest.

If it’s true… does she realize what she’s involved in?

My husband sighed. "That’s why I want you to come home. Staying with them isn’t safe. Honestly, after seeing this, I don’t even want you near her anymore. There’s something seriously wrong with both of them."

I stayed silent.

Sophia had been my closest friend since college. How could she have changed like this?

The room was dead quiet.

My husband waited for my response. My thoughts drifted to last night—Sophia’s insistence that he loves me.

What if she’s being manipulated? What if she thinks this is love?

The justification formed in my mind. I couldn’t abandon her to this.

I scrolled to the latest comment, posted two days ago:

"Is the girlfriend available for rent? Name your price."

Below, Derek’s reply: [DM me.]
###Chapter 7

My determination to save my best friend grew stronger. I didn’t know if that online comment was true, but if it was…

Then Sophia wasn’t just enduring domestic abuse and having videos taken of her—she was being exploited by Derek to make money.

Ignoring my husband’s protests, I rushed back to her place. I needed answers. If she truly believed this was love, I had to make sure she was in her right mind—that this was her choice.

We’d been friends for six or seven years. I couldn’t let her throw herself away like some cheap commodity.

When I arrived, I planned to confront her immediately, but Derek was home.

I walked in to find them cooking together in the kitchen.

Sophia wore a thin top, washing vegetables at the sink, occasionally flicking water at Derek.

He stood at the stove in an apron, chopping onions before wiping his hands on her face.

She giggled and dodged, and he turned off the burner, chasing her playfully.

Both of them were laughing, the scene sickeningly sweet.

"Jasmine, you're back!" Sophia called out between laughs before ducking away from Derek’s teasing.

The cheerful atmosphere made me freeze.

Last night’s tears and pleas for help felt like a dream.

Right now, they looked like any other happy couple.

But the photos I’d seen at home were real.

The videos showed their apartment—the living room, the table—all marked by struggle. Some clips depicted Sophia willing, others forced, her cries for mercy ignored before the camera rolled.

I waited days for a chance to speak with her alone.

At first, she played dumb. When I mentioned the lingerie photos and videos, she acted like I had the wrong person.

But when I described her apartment and threatened to go to the police, she panicked.

She begged me not to, admitting she knew everything.

Derek had shown her the videos. He’d been "good" to her—never letting her face be seen, no matter how much clients offered.

"Good to you?!" I was furious.

Selling videos of her online was good just because her face was hidden?

"I didn’t want to at first," she sniffled. "It started with just photos. I was embarrassed. Then suddenly he wanted videos. I fought back, but… it was just us at home."

She claimed she’d been forced at first, but over time, she’d given in.

Some of the most violent clips—the ones where she resisted the hardest—sold the best.

And afterward, Derek would take her out to eat.

That was her compensation? A few meals?

Disgusted, I cut to the chase: Had he made her sleep with other men?

I expected a firm no. After all, she’d been with me outside of work.

But she hesitated. "I… don’t know."

"Don’t know?" I stared. "It’s yes or no. How can you not know?!"

"Sometimes he blindfolded me for… roleplay. I couldn’t tell who it was."

Her eyes betrayed her.

After all this time with Derek, she knew.

"You’ve been manipulated. This isn’t how healthy relationships work—"

"It’s my life!" she snapped. "If you’re really my friend, drop it."

Sophia was too far gone.

We parted on bad terms. I packed my things and left.

She didn’t stop me, just watched silently, her expression unreadable.

I swore I’d wash my hands of this. But guilt drove me to Derek’s post. I commented:

{Aren’t you afraid someone will report you?}

The reply vanished instantly.

I went to the gym where Derek worked, only to learn he hadn’t shown up in days.

One last try. I’d confront him at home, warn him he was breaking the law.

But when I reached his rundown apartment in the old district, people were coming and going.

Before I even stepped inside, I heard Sophia’s moans.

I burst in—

And froze.

Sophia lay on the bed, surrounded by Derek and five other men.

"Stop!" I shouted. "This is illegal!"

Derek snarled at me to mind my own business.

But Sophia’s tearful scream cut through: "Jasmine! Help me!"

I shoved past the men, grabbed a lamp, and shielded her.

She sobbed that after I left, Derek had dropped all pretense. He’d lured her here, to this filthy place, for these men.

Derek sneered. "What’s the big deal? She’s a cam girl. Everyone’s seen her already."

I pulled out my phone to call the police.

Sophia suddenly shrieked—then lunged at me, pinning me down.

Stunned, I barely registered Derek yanking at my pants.

I fought wildly, but Sophia held my arms just like that night when Derek had tried to assault me.

"What are you doing?!" I screamed.

Her voice was eerily calm. "Just try it, Jasmine. It feels amazing once you let go. Derek’s good. They’re all good. The videos are thrilling. You’ll have men worshipping you. You’ll be more popular than me."

I thrashed like a madwoman, but my clothes were being torn away.

One man hesitated. "This… this is rape."

Derek grinned. "Who cares? Once we film her, she’ll keep quiet. Five against one—you think she’ll risk her reputation? Even if we don’t touch her, she reports us, and the cops come knocking."

"Might as well have fun. Then we’ve got leverage. She won’t dare talk."

He leered. "A trust fund baby’s wife. A ballet teacher. Prime material."

Terror clawed at me. I kicked, but Sophia held fast, murmuring, "Shh. It’ll be over soon. You’ll join me in my world."

I gritted my teeth. "Never. I already called the—"

Before I could finish, Sophia clamped a hand over my mouth.

I couldn’t scream.

I couldn’t breathe.
###Chapter 8

She lay naked on top of me, eerily calm. "Jasmine, do you know how much I've envied you since college?"

"I envied your privileged background, your perfect family."

"I envied your educated parents, the province you were born in."

"Do you have any idea how hard I worked in middle and high school just to get into the same university as you?"

"Your grades wouldn’t even get you into a community college in my province. But because of your family, your personality, you were always the golden girl everyone adored."

"I’m just as pretty as you. My personality isn’t worse than yours. I worked ten times harder."

"But after all that effort, I ended up with a personal trainer boyfriend."

"While you got a trust fund baby who worships you, loves you, tolerates you—who actually understands you!"

"Why does someone from his world love you so much?"

"Why does every good thing in life just fall into your lap?"

"And now, even after everything I’ve done—"

"You still flaunt it in my face, talking about how your husband will apologize? Why?"

"My life is already ruined."

"No matter what I do, I’ll never have the happiness you have."

"So the only thing left is to drag you down with me."

"Don’t worry—even if you bite my hand to shreds, I won’t let go. If the police come, even better. Let them see you surrounded by these lowlives—"

Epilogue

Turns out, I really am the golden girl.

At the most critical moment, one of the men actually fought Derek.

Rumor was, he’d just come to pay for sex.

But when it turned into a "conspiracy to rape," he refused to participate.

Not only did he back out—

He physically stopped the others from touching me, terrified of being implicated if things escalated.

During the struggle, a neighbor knocked on the door. The man’s loud protests froze the others in place.

Then the police arrived.

Every one of them was arrested. My husband held me so tightly I could barely breathe.

That strong, composed man broke down sobbing when he saw me. He kept saying how terrified he’d been, how he’d feared the worst.

He swore it didn’t matter what had happened—he’d love me no matter what. We could move cities, start over.

I was still dazed.

The police hadn’t even told him I hadn’t been assaulted yet.

And there he was, pouring his heart out all over again.
