###Chapter 1

After my husband passed away, I lived alone with two children.

To get a promotion, I took an ice bath and then went to the manager's office.

Unexpectedly, even though I offered myself, he refused to touch me at the company.

Just when I thought the promotion was doomed, he took me, barely dressed, to a busy street full of traffic.

"Let's do it right here," he said.

...

My name is Olivia Anderson. I am 36 years old and have two children.

Recently, there was a promotion opportunity at the company, and everyone was trying to curry favor with the manager.

Naturally, I wanted that promotion too, so I came up with a plan.

During the lunch break, I went home and took an ice bath.

I could clearly feel my skin tightening bit by bit.

Not just my skin—other parts of my body became firmer too.

I also made sure to apply fragrant body lotion.

When I arrived at the office, not only were the male colleagues staring, but Manager Julian Roscente's eyes were fixed on me too.

He took the bait! I smiled triumphantly.

"Manager Julian, there's some work I don't quite understand. I’d like to ask you about it."

Wearing tight jeans, I walked toward him step by step.

"What kind of work?" Julian asked, his gaze unwavering.

He looked me over even more boldly, from head to toe.

"Let's discuss it in your office," I suggested.

As I spoke, the keys in my pocket suddenly fell to the ground.

I bent down to pick them up, but two buttons on my blouse unexpectedly popped open.

"Ah!" I hurriedly covered my blouse.

But I’m a mother of two, so my figure is naturally quite full.

And I usually go braless out of habit.

So at that moment, my hands couldn’t cover everything.

All eyes turned toward me. The male colleagues looked like they wanted to devour me.

Just then, Julian quickly covered me with his jacket and led me to his office.

"Thank you, Manager Julian," I said, lowering my head and biting my lip.

I thought he would let me go, but his hands seemed glued to me, holding me firmly.

"Olivia Anderson, right? Are you new here?"

"Yes..." I had indeed just joined the company less than a month ago.

I never thought I’d get so lucky to encounter a promotion opportunity so soon.

And I’d heard that Julian had a reputation for being lustful. How could I let this chance slip away?

"Are your children still breastfeeding?" Julian suddenly asked, his hands still exploring.

I blushed deeply. "No, my children are already in elementary school."

Julian smirked slightly. His intense gaze felt like it was seeing right through me.

"Then why do you have such a sweet scent on you?"

Hearing this, I suddenly remembered the body lotion I had applied.

It seemed to have worked—he noticed it.

I lowered my head, twisting my hands together, pretending to be embarrassed.

"Maybe... it’s just natural," I murmured.

The next moment, he suddenly wrapped his arm around my waist, his warm breath brushing against my neck.

"You’ve already had two children, yet you’re still so shy?"

"How did your late husband treat you? Tell me about it."

Oh my god, how could he be so direct?

Even though I’d heard about his reputation, I still found it hard to handle.

"Manager Julian, my husband has been dead for a long time. It’s been so long since I’ve..."

My face burned as if about to explode.

Smack! Julian suddenly slapped me.

"Ouch!" I couldn’t help crying out.

Julian laughed arrogantly.

"You can’t handle even this?"

He pinned me against the desk.

His fingers traced my skin. After the ice bath, my skin felt uncomfortably tight.

"Manager Julian, please let me go. Let’s... let’s talk about work first," I stammered.

He chuckled and gripped my waist firmly.

"And yet you still have the nerve to talk about work?"

"Why are women always so contradictory?"

My face grew hotter, and I couldn’t utter a word.

This Julian really knew how to push buttons!

"But your skin is quite nice. How is it so fair?"

He suddenly nuzzled close to my ear.

His warm, breathy voice whispered into my ear.
###Chapter 2

My entire body went weak.

I nearly collapsed to the floor.

Fortunately, his large hands held me firmly in place.

"My skin has always been like this since childhood..."

Before I could finish speaking, the jacket Julian had given me slipped and fell to the ground.

Now there was nothing left to cover me.

"Ah."

I gasped in fright and hurriedly bent down to pick it up.

Unexpectedly, I bumped right into Julian as I straightened up.

"Hmm..."

He grunted softly.

I quickly stepped back.

"Sorry, sorry! I didn't mean to!"

There was only the desk behind me.

Even stepping back, I remained dangerously close to him.

And he was standing right in front of me.

The slightest misstep, and I would touch him again.

So I could only clutch his jacket tightly around me, not daring to move an inch.

"Olivia, did you and your husband ever... like this?"

As he spoke, he gradually moved closer to me.

In that moment, all the blood in my body seemed to freeze.

I gripped the clothes tightly.

"Manager Roscente, please don't..."

But he pressed closer, showing no intention of letting me go.

My face burned fiercely.

My mind was a complete mess.

"Why not? Don't you like it? Just give it a try, okay?"

His voice was utterly hypnotic.

Sweat broke out all over my body.

I turned my head away in shame.

Suddenly, someone knocked on the office door.

"Manager Roscente, I've brought your coffee."

A woman's voice came from outside the door.

Startled, I pushed Julian away.

I stood up, straightened my clothes, and went to open the door.

Unexpectedly, the person outside was my female colleague, Zoey.

She wore a slip dress.

Her skin was smooth and flawless.

Her figure was absolutely explosive.

As she passed by me, she shot me a disdainful glance.

She swayed her hips and walked directly into the office.

I figured she was also here to compete for the promotion.

This promotion not only came with a raise but also an extended vacation.

Who wouldn't be tempted?

I clenched my fists.

I swore to myself I would get this position.

After work, I went straight home.

I needed to take an ice bath to maintain my skin's firmness for my plan.

After all, I was already middle-aged.

This was the only method I could rely on.

I soaked in the ice bath.

It was so cold, so very cold.

That familiar sensation of tight skin and goosebumps returned.

I took an item from the drawer.

I lay back in the tub and took a selfie.

At exactly midnight, I posted that photo to my Moments.

I set the visibility to Julian only.

The caption read: ["Just muddling through a lonely night."]

Julian was always a night owl.

I bet he would see this post.

Sure enough, he sent me a WeChat message the very next second.

["Still awake this late?"]

I deliberately waited a moment before replying.

["Thank you for your concern, Manager Roscente. I've just been under a lot of pressure lately."]

["What pressure could you possibly have?"] He sent the message along with a drooling emoji.

I thought about how he had acted towards me during the day.

It made me feel shy all over again.

My scalp tingled.

["The promotion, of course. Everyone is giving it their all. I naturally can't slack off either."]

["Oh, I see. Well, you'll really have to step up your game then. After all, you're already middle-aged. It's hard to compete with younger girls."]

Yes, I was already middle-aged.

My looks naturally couldn't compare to younger girls.

But I was accustomed to ice baths.

My skin was firmer than most.

Many men desired me.

I smiled with satisfaction.

It seemed Julian had some interest in me too.

I had to work hard.

I needed to secure that position quickly.

I replied to him.

["I will definitely work hard."]

Early the next morning, I went to the company after my ice bath.

Julian kept summoning me to his office to report on work.

But I kept saying I was busy.

Playing hard to get works on any man.

This time, I would secure that promotion opportunity without fail.

Unexpectedly, Julian couldn't hold back by noon.
###Chapter 3
He rushed over and pinned me against the desk while everyone was out for lunch.

"Damn it, do you have any idea how long I've been holding back?"

He spoke while inhaling my scent.

"You smell amazing. Let me find where this fragrance is coming from."

"Mr. Roscente, you can't do this..."

He gripped my chin, his eyes burning with desire.

"Stop pretending. Isn't this what you wanted? To sleep your way to the top?"

"Since your skin is so smooth, I might consider it."

"But first, you need to please me."

My eyes lit up at the mention of a promotion.

"How... how should I please you?"

He chuckled.

"Tonight, I want you kneeling on the street, completely naked, begging for my attention."

"And call me Master."

I never expected Julian to have such tastes!

Though it might get me promoted, the shame was overwhelming.

As I hesitated, someone began unlocking the office door.

Julian held me tightly by the waist, completely unbothered.

"I don't mind if everyone finds out how you're climbing the ladder."

He traced his fingers along my waist, tickling me.

I squirmed and reluctantly agreed.

But what was his real motive?

Was he just using me to satisfy his twisted desires?

How many other women had he done this to?

That evening, a package arrived at my door.

It was from Julian—a sheer outfit.

He texted me: "Walking out naked is too plain. Wear this instead."

But this outfit was practically invisible!

It was even more humiliating.

He seemed to read my mind and followed up: "Finish by midnight, or forget about the promotion!"

I checked the time—11:30 PM. I rushed to change and headed out.

The outfit was tight, digging into my skin.

People stared as I passed.

I covered my face and found a deserted street.

Julian’s video call came through. He smiled on screen.

"Louder! Beg me!"

Shame washed over me. I bit my lip, fighting inner turmoil.

"Hurry up!"

His urging made my face burn.

"Master... please, I beg for your favor."

As I spoke, I noticed faces peering from nearby apartments.

Julian laughed, satisfied.

"Wait for me. I'm coming to get you."

I rushed home, changed, and soaked in an ice bath to soothe my skin.

Just as I finished, Julian arrived.

His intense gaze locked onto me.

I placed my hands on his shoulders, voice soft and pleading. "Mr. Roscente, can we go to your place?"

His expression shifted.

"My place? Aren’t you afraid? I have... interesting things there."

I nodded eagerly. "I'm not scared."

But he didn’t move.

"Not yet. We’re not that familiar. I can’t take you home."

"Tonight, we stay here."

I resisted. "But... I’m on my period."

He pulled a sizable object from his pocket.

His eyes never left mine.

"Don’t worry. I have this. It won’t hurt you."

My God, he carried that with him?

I stepped back, swallowing hard.

"Mr. Roscente, I—"

He yanked me into his arms before I could finish.

I trembled, pleading for mercy.

"Heh, and you said you wanted to go to my place? You can’t even handle this!"

His command hissed in my ear: "Call me Master. Beg me to let you go."

What a pervert!

But I had no choice. "Master, please let me go. I’m begging you."

He laughed, seeming even more aroused.
###Chapter 4
"Olivia Anderson, who would have guessed this is what you're like behind closed doors."

His hands roamed freely as he spoke.

"Tsk tsk, I really want to make you cry."

I had never experienced such sensations before.

Julian Roscente laughed arrogantly before leaving me weakened and exhausted.

He said he needed to test me further before taking me home and giving me that promotion.

But I was too impatient for the promotion. I had to try another approach.

Early the next morning, I took another ice bath. I wore the clothes Julian had given me underneath my outer coat.

Before leaving home, I deliberately posted a selfie that revealed the outfit underneath.

The caption read: [Love what I'm wearing today.]

Julian liked it almost immediately.

I knew he wouldn't be able to resist.

At the office, I wandered around in my high heels.

During lunch, I purposely remarked, "It's so hot today."

Then I unbuttoned my coat to reveal the form-fitting dress underneath.

It was summer, and beads of sweat glistened on my skin.

The tight dress accentuated every curve.

I could feel covert glances from others. I was sure Julian noticed too.

He would be mine.

Finally, after work, when everyone had left, I took off my coat completely.

I walked step by step toward Julian's office.

"Manager Roscente, what are you up to?"

Before I could push the door open, someone grabbed me from behind, pinning me against the desk. Hot breath brushed my neck.

"Baby, you have an amazing body. So firm."

It wasn't Julian's voice—it was a male colleague's.

I shoved him away angrily. "Get off me!"

He leered. "What's wrong? You've been flaunting yourself all day. Isn't this what you wanted?"

I didn’t want him.

I wanted Julian.

I wrapped my coat tightly and pushed past him. "I'm not interested."

But he lunged at me, intent on forcing himself.

"I don't care if you're interested. I'm having you today!"

Terrified, I grabbed a nearby vase and smashed it over his head.

I rushed out immediately. On the stairs, I sensed someone following me.

I turned. It was Julian in his suit, smiling brightly. "Seems you really do like me. Saving yourself for me, are you?"

I glared furiously. "You set that up, didn't you?"

He admitted without shame. "Of course. I had to see if you're truly loyal to me."

"After all, I am your master."

"Now kneel and call me 'master.' Then I'll take you home. You'll get your promotion tomorrow."

Julian never missed a chance to test my limits.

But for that promotion, I swallowed my pride.

I dropped to my knees with a thud.

"Master, please take me home."

He smiled in satisfaction and fastened a collar around my neck.

"From now on, you belong to me."

Then he pressed a remote.

The collar tightened instantly, choking me.

My face turned red as I struggled for air. "Let... go."

He lifted me up sharply.

"Forgotten the rules? Say 'master'!"

"Master... please let me go. I beg you."

Soon, Julian brought me to his basement.

He was an absolute deviant.

A massive shelf stood against the wall, filled with various instruments and colorful potions.

In the center was a chair fitted with chains.

I had only read about such things in novels.

The sight made my legs weak.

Julian embraced me from behind and whispered, "Scared?"

"No, not scared. I like it."

I answered softly.

"Manager Roscente, have you brought anyone else here before?"

He pushed me onto the chair, caging me in with his arms.

"Guess."

Swiftly, he wrapped the chains around my wrists.

"Manager Roscente, be gentle."

He gripped my hands firmly.

I trembled uncontrollably from fear.

"Slower... please."

He chuckled. "You really weren’t lying. It has been a while, hasn’t it?"

I blushed and looked down, too embarrassed to speak.

Then he picked up a syringe filled with a shimmering pink liquid.
###Chapter 5
"This injection will make you beg for more."
"Want to try it?"

He smirked wickedly.
Fear finally gripped my heart.

I thought he was just playing games, but he actually intended to inject me with drugs.
"Mr. Roscente, please don't do this. I beg you."

I pleaded in terror.
He grabbed my shoulders and forced me down onto the chair.

"Too late for regrets. You came here willingly."
"I wonder how many of these substances you'll endure."

In that moment, I realized I had walked into a lion's den.
I couldn't hold back my tears anymore. "No... don't do this to me."

He laughed hysterically. "Cry harder! Your tears excite me!"
"Today, you'll experience pleasures beyond your imagination!"

Just as the needle was about to pierce my skin, the basement door burst open.
"Freeze! Police!"

Julian dropped the syringe in shock, his face pale.
"You..."

Tears still in my eyes, I whispered with a faint smile, "Did you think I approached you without a purpose?"
Then I resumed crying.

"Ah! Don't touch me! Stay away, you rapist!"
Julian wasn't angry. He sneered, "Olivia, you're clever. But the final laugh isn't yours yet."

He was swiftly handcuffed and taken away by the police.
A female officer escorted me out, offering water and comfort.

"Thank goodness your smartwatch alerted us. Otherwise, you'd have been in real danger. Your two children are waiting for you back home."
I smiled bitterly. "Yes. Thank you, Officer."

She added, "Even though your husband is gone, you must take care of yourself."
This officer had handled my husband's case a year ago and had always shown kindness.

"I understand."
"Don't worry. I'll do everything to help investigate who killed your husband."

But I already knew the truth.
A year ago, my husband died suddenly from poisoning at work.

Julian had been his colleague then.
They were equally competent, competing for the same promotion.

After my husband's death, Julian naturally became the manager.
I was certain he was the murderer.

The police suspected him too but found no evidence.
I took matters into my own hands, tracking his daily routines.

I discovered his perverted nature and obsession with harassing women.
He drove them to mental breakdowns, then paid them off.

So I joined his company intentionally.
I risked everything to search his home for evidence.

Today, I found those drugs in his basement.
I secretly recorded everything with my smartwatch and called the police, pretending to be assaulted.

"Officer, I believe Julian killed my husband. Please test those substances in his basement."
She nodded. "I'll get to the bottom of this."

Over a year of seeking revenge had exhausted me.
I took a shower and fell into a deep sleep.

But nightmares followed.
A man touched my body and injected me with a needle.

He laughed maniacally. "Did you think you won? I told you—the final laugh isn't yours!"
I woke up with a jolt.

Julian stood before me, holding an empty syringe.
The drugs were already inside me.

My body reacted almost immediately.
"You... you monster!"

He grinned like a cunning fox.
"Not a monster—just smarter than you."

"Olivia, you didn't even change your name when you joined the company."
"Didn't your husband tell you? He showed me your photos and mentioned your name."

"I knew your intentions from day one."
###Chapter 6
I never imagined he actually knew me.

My late husband had never mentioned sharing details about me with Julian.

That’s why I assumed Julian had no idea who I was.

I fought desperately, digging my nails into my thighs to stay conscious.

“Then why didn’t you kill me outright? Why play this twisted game?”

He laughed coldly, tracing the needle lightly over my skin.

“Because of this flawless skin of yours.”

“So soft, so fair. I’ve touched countless women, but none compare to you.”

“I wanted to play with you. Watch you cry. Watch you naively believe you could avenge your pathetic husband. It thrilled me.”

He breathed heavily near my ear.

I trembled, barely holding myself together.

“Was that man last time also part of your scheme to humiliate me?”

“Of course. If you hadn’t fought back, both of us would have had our way with you at the office that day.”

He was truly depraved and vile.

The drug was pushing me to the edge of sanity.

I clung to my last shred of clarity, staring straight at him.

“I still don’t understand how you escaped the police.”

“You really are foolish. Didn’t I say I saw through you from the start? Did you think I wouldn’t prepare?”

“I replaced all the chemicals in the basement with ordinary water and drinks.”

“The police had no grounds to arrest me. Plus, my basement surveillance showed you came with me willingly.”

“Olivia, you’re out of your league trying to challenge me.”

He grabbed me and dragged me into the bathroom, binding my hands with his belt.

“Darling, shall we begin here?”

“You monster! Don’t touch me!”

I screamed hoarsely.

Even as my mind fogged, I clung to my last resolve.

Unfazed, he slowly began undoing my clothes.

“I’ve always wondered how your skin stays so perfect.”

“If… if you want to know, tell me how you murdered my husband.”

I forced the words out.

He stood and scanned the room for hidden devices before answering.

“Remember last Valentine’s Day?”

“You gave him a thermos filled with sweet soup.”

“He bragged to me about how wonderful his wife was. So I laced that soup with a lethal poison.”

“The very thing he took pride in ended up killing him. How poetic!”

“The police could never trace the toxin. I developed it myself—untraceable.”

“Oh, and Olivia… know this? His last words were begging me to spare you.”

“But now I’m going to ruin you completely.”

He lunged, pinning me hard against the floor.

His shadowed eyes bore into me.

“Now it’s your turn. Tell me—how did you maintain such perfect skin?”

Rage burned through me.

He had destroyed the happy life I shared with my husband.

I hated him with every fiber of my being.

“Guess.”

I mimicked his taunting tone, provoking him deliberately.

Enraged, he choked my neck.

“Tell me now, or I’ll end you!”

I only laughed coldly.

“What’s so funny?!”

“You! You’re a fool—arrogant and blind!”

I stared defiantly, using my ring to cut into my thigh—pain keeping me focused.

“Did you really think I spent over a year doing nothing?”

“I studied you. Learned your sick patterns. This was always a two-phase plan. This time, you won’t escape.”

His face paled instantly.

“You set me up!”

He scrambled toward the door.

But the police were already there, tackling him to the ground.

After a futile struggle, he glared at me and laughed maniacally.

“Olivia Anderson! If I survive this, I’ll destroy you!”

But this time… he wouldn’t survive.
###Chapter 7
After Julian was taken away, I was also sent to the hospital.

I had been injected with drugs and had to endure the withdrawal on my own to recover.

During my hospital stay, Zoey came to see me.

She is actually my late husband’s sister.

She looked at me with deep concern in her eyes.
"You insisted on putting yourself in danger," she said.
"You almost let him destroy you."

I smiled weakly.
"If I hadn’t done this, I would never have been able to send him to prison."

For over a year, I had been planning my revenge.

I knew Julian was a psychopath and a clever man.

His family also had strong connections.
If I had taken him to court, I would have lost.

So I carefully crafted a revenge plan.

I tailored every detail to match Julian’s personality.

I kept my name unchanged on purpose so he would recognize me.
I wanted him to let his guard down.
I wanted him to think I was acting alone.

At the same time, Zoey deliberately seduced him.
She acted as a spy in his home.

That’s how I was the first to know when he was released from police custody.

I immediately formed a new plan.
I quickly notified the police officer that Julian was coming to harm me.

Without evidence, we couldn’t call the police right away.

So the officer waited outside my door under the guise of being a friend.

As soon as Julian confessed to all the murders, she quickly called her colleagues.
They arrested him and took him to prison.

"Thank you, Zoey," I said.
"Without you, I could never have sent Julian to prison alone."

She held my hand, her eyes red.
"Family doesn’t need to thank family, Olivia."
"My brother is gone, and it hurts me too."
"Putting Julian behind bars was my wish as well."
"So you don’t have to thank me."

"Alright," I said.
"From now on, let’s run a business together."

She nodded.
"Okay."

After being discharged from the hospital, I looked up at the blue sky and breathed a long sigh of relief.

Finally, I had fulfilled my goal of over a year.

Ethan, can you see me?

Just then, the police officer walked over to me.
She told me Julian had been sentenced to death.

"I heard he’s gone insane in prison," she said.
"He keeps muttering about not wanting to die."

Hearing this, I felt a chill of fear.

"Is he faking insanity to avoid execution?"

The officer smiled.
"I suspected that from the beginning."
"But the police aren’t fools."
"We had doctors examine him."
"He was indeed pretending."
"His execution will be carried out immediately, tomorrow."

I breathed a sigh of relief.

"Thank you, Officer."

Dealing with someone like Julian really required strategy.

The next day, Zoey and I went to the prison.
We requested to see Julian one last time.

I wanted to taunt him before his death.

I wanted him to know that women are not to be underestimated.

When he saw Zoey and me, his eyes widened in shock.
He could hardly believe it.

"Zoey," he stammered, "you’re with her?"

Zoey smiled faintly.
"Of course."
"Did you really think it was your charm that drew me to you?"
"Julian, you’re ugly, obese, and a psychopath."
"No one could ever love you."

He gritted his teeth in rage.
"After everything I did for you," he snarled, "I want to know why!"

"Because I’m Ethan’s sister," Zoey said.
"Olivia and I spent over a year preparing to send you to prison."

Her words shattered Julian completely.

He was arrogant and mentally unstable.

He never expected to be outsmarted by two women.

He clenched his fists and glared at us furiously.
"Just you wait," he hissed.
"If there’s a next life, I’ll make sure both of you die!"

"You won’t have a next life," I said softly.

I looked straight into his eyes.
"After all the evil you’ve done, do you really think you deserve another chance?"
"You’re going to hell, Julian."

After I spoke, he completely lost control.
He slammed his fist against the glass.

A guard rushed over and tasered him.
In the end, he was dragged away, eyes filled with hatred and resentment.

Zoey and I smiled at each other.
Then we packed our bags and prepared to return to our hometown.

There, we opened a small eatery together.
We lived fulfilling lives every day.

I could take care of my two children every day.
