###Chapter 1
What's it like massaging pregnant women? These women, enduring prolonged marital celibacy, often request... additional services from me.


My name is Jake Lawrence, and I’m currently a prenatal massage therapist—which, as the name suggests, means I specialize in providing massages for pregnant women.

The person who introduced me to this line of work was my cousin, Ryan Roscente. Every time he came back to our hometown, he was decked out in designer clothes, his hair slicked back, and the whole village would say he’d made it big. So when he told me he’d take me to the city to strike it rich, even though we didn’t exactly get along, I agreed without hesitation.

It wasn’t until I followed him to the city that I found out what he actually did for a living.

Honestly, at first, I wasn’t keen on the idea. In this line of work, if you’re not careful with your technique and something happens to the pregnant woman, you’re screwed.

Ryan pulled out his phone and showed me his rates—a single session cost a staggering five figures. That blew my mind.

In my understanding, massage therapists were supposed to be part of the service industry, with pretty low wages. But Ryan just grinned and saida I’d understand soon enough.

Not long after, I got my first house-call opportunity.

The client’s name was Vanessa Valentine, 31 years old. Before I could even take a proper look at her photo, Ryan snatched it away from me.

He waggled his eyebrows at me. "Cousin, you lucky dog—this one’s a real voluptuous babe. Today, I’ll let you in on the secret to success: play it by ear. You’re getting the good stuff. In all my years doing this, I’ve never come across such a hot pregnant woman."

Play it by ear? I didn’t get it, especially with that sleazy grin on his face.

In the massage industry, let’s be real—most clients are of the opposite sex, and things tend to happen. But our clientele was… special. I figured nothing would go down.

Still, I was pretty excited for my first official job.

Clients who booked home massages were usually well-off, and this address was no exception—a high-end residential complex with lush greenery and top-notch amenities.

I followed the directions straight to the client’s door.

When she answered, I was stunned.

Her wavy hair cascaded effortlessly over her shoulders, tousled and carefree. Her lips were a seductive red, and even in simple maternity wear, she carried herself with an undeniable allure. And those curves—busty didn’t even begin to cover it.

Her belly was slightly rounded, maybe four or five months along.

Pregnancy hadn’t made her look maternal—if anything, it had only amplified her femininity.

The thought of giving a woman like her a massage made my pulse quicken. Serving a beauty of this caliber was practically an honor.

Vanessa pointed to the couch. "Wait here. I need to shower first." I nodded hastily.

I sat stiffly on the sofa, waiting.

The sound of running water filled the air, and my mind conjured up images of her stepping out, her full, shapely body glistening under the spray. Just as my imagination was running wild, a loud thud came from the bathroom, followed by a sharp scream.

Vanessa’s panicked voice called out, "Ah—masseur, could you come here for a second?"

Worried about the shock to her system—pregnant women were fragile, after all—I rushed over and was met with a sight that sent my blood racing.

Vanessa stood there, draped in nothing but a thin towel, her bare feet damp, water droplets clinging to her hair and cheeks. She huddled in the corner of the bathroom, looking utterly helpless.

Before I could process it, a blur of white lunged at me. A warm body crashed into my arms, and I instinctively caught her, my hands landing on smooth, slick skin.

Only then did I realize—Vanessa had thrown herself against me. From my angle, the view was… unrestricted. The sight left me dazed.

She lifted her doe-like eyes, glistening with moisture, and pouted. "There’s a mouse. I’m scared."

I glanced around. There was no mouse—she must’ve imagined it.

With a beauty in my arms, I didn’t know whether to move or stay frozen.

All I could manage was a stiff, "It’s okay. You just saw wrong."

Then, out of nowhere, Vanessa burst into laughter. "Wow, I didn’t take you for the innocent type."

At that point, even an idiot would’ve realized—this was all a joke on her part. Besides, a high-end place like this wouldn’t have mice.

By the time I’d collected myself and stepped out of the bathroom, Vanessa was already lying on the bed.

She was still wrapped in that towel, her cleavage spilling over in a way that made my throat dry.

Summoning my courage, I began the massage. The moment my hands touched her waist, Vanessa let out a soft moan. "Mmm… that tickles."

Her voice was downright sinful. My heart hammered against my ribs.

I tried to focus on the job, keeping my movements professional.

Halfway through, Vanessa suddenly grabbed my hand and pressed it against her chest.

My first thought? So soft. So full. My fingers sank in, the smoothness making them curl instinctively. The second I squeezed, Vanessa gasped, her breath hitching.

"Rub them for me, masseur," she murmured, her voice dripping with suggestion. "They’re so sore."

My mind went blank. All I could hear was Ryan’s play it by ear and Vanessa’s little whimpers. My hands moved on their own, kneading gently. I gritted my teeth, resigning myself to the torture. This was going to kill me.

Any man would’ve been driven wild by this kind of teasing. Heat pooled low in my body.

Then, abruptly, Vanessa called it off.
###Chapter 2.

She twisted her voluptuous hips and reached for her phone on the nightstand.

The movement caused the towel to ride up, exposing what little it had barely concealed. Now, nothing remained hidden.

The view was breathtaking.

My throat went dry, and I swallowed hard.

Vanessa's cheeks flushed crimson as she fumbled to readjust the towel. The moment she covered her lower half, her ample curves spilled into view—like trying to hide one thing only to expose another.

I stared, mesmerized, before catching myself and forcing my gaze away.

With a pout, she whined in that honeyed tone, "Jake, give me a leg massage, won't you? My legs have gotten so much thicker since the pregnancy."

Before I could react, she lifted her leg and draped it over my arm.

From this angle, I had an unobstructed view of her flawless body. The slight swell of her belly did nothing to diminish her allure.

Following her lead, I kneaded her legs, my own body reacting in ways that made the situation both torturous and thrilling.

Just when I thought the massage would end, her foot trailed up my chest. Then, perhaps mindful of the baby, she slid it lower, brushing against my groin with deliberate, teasing pressure.

At twenty, I was all raw need. My face burned as she explored me with bold curiosity.

Vanessa studied me with playful interest. "Jake, can you massage... everywhere?"

"Of course," I answered automatically, professionalism warring with desire.

"Then work here." She guided my hand lower, and the slick heat I encountered shocked me.

This woman was desperate.

The old village tales about pregnant women's heightened needs were true. I tried to pull away, but the movement only excited her more. Soft moans escaped her lips.

Being this close to a mature, experienced woman was something I'd never dared imagine.

Now, the opportunity was right in front of me—and I hesitated.

Professional ethics screamed that this was wrong.

Vanessa sensed my conflict. Leaning close, her breath warm against my ear, she murmured, "My husband hasn't touched me since I got pregnant. Says I should 'rest for the baby.' It's like being sentenced to marital celibacy."
###Chapter 3.

I was on edge, unsure what to do next.

Suddenly, the phone rang, and I shot up like it was a lifeline.

Vanessa pouted, clearly annoyed. "Fine, I'll let you off this time. Go on, pretty boy."

She took the call and waved me off with a dismissive hand.

Strangely, I felt an inexplicable pang of disappointment as I left.

Just as I reached the foyer, I remembered I'd forgotten a tool. When I turned back, I overheard Vanessa say:

"Of course you're the best, Ryan. Not just your massage skills—you're incredible in bed too."

My mind raced. Was she talking about Ryan Roscente? But earlier, he'd acted like he didn’t know her.

She didn’t seem about to hang up, and I wasn’t the type to eavesdrop.

I figured I could always come back for the tool later—or just leave it. It wasn’t worth much anyway.

On the way home, I kept thinking about this "Ryan" she’d mentioned.

Coincidentally, Ryan was at my apartment when I got back.

He smirked when he saw me, slinging an arm over my shoulder. "So, little cousin, how was the client? Big?"

Before I could stop myself, I shot back, "You tell me, Ryan. Shouldn’t you know?"

I instantly regretted saying it out loud, but it didn’t matter. He’d seen Vanessa’s photos—he knew exactly how "big" she was.

Ryan clicked his tongue. "Don’t trust photos, kid. These days, editing can turn a pumpkin into a princess."

"Last week, I had a client who’d gained fifty pounds during pregnancy. Her social media pics? Total catfish."

"Goddamn pregnant women. So damn fussy."

He ranted on, and I studied him carefully.

Even if they knew each other, why hide it from me?

Was he afraid I’d steal his clients? Maybe.

I shrugged it off and moved on.

A few days later, another booking came in.

The address was Vanessa’s. A competitive spark flared in me.

She’d claimed I couldn’t compare to Ryan, yet here she was, calling me back. Honestly, I had full confidence in my massage skills.

I packed my gear and headed to her place.

When I arrived, the door was wide open. Before I could step inside, the sound of shattering dishes and a heated argument spilled out.

Vanessa was screaming at a man—someone I didn’t recognize.

This wasn’t my business. If it was a lovers’ quarrel, my presence would only complicate things.

I peeked inside cautiously. The place was wrecked, furniture smashed to pieces.

The man yanked Vanessa by her hair, dragging her out. Tears streaked her face, a brutal handprint stark against her pale skin. Despite the pain, she clutched her swollen belly protectively.

"Please," she sobbed. "I’m pregnant. Don’t hurt me—don’t hurt the baby!"

When he reared back to kick her stomach, I snapped.

I couldn’t stand by and watch. That kick could’ve killed her.

I rushed in to intervene.

Vanessa’s eyes lit up with desperate relief. "Help me! I don’t even know him!"

Broad daylight, and this bastard was assaulting a pregnant woman? Unbelievable.

I punched him square in the face. With my strength, it didn’t take much to pin him down. One hand kept him immobilized while the other reached for my phone.

Then Vanessa screamed, clutching her stomach in pain.

Distracted, I loosened my grip—and the guy bolted.

Fury burned through me. What kind of coward hits a woman? I’d have beaten him senseless if I could.

Vanessa whimpered, tugging my arm. "It hurts… carry me to bed."

Her pallor worried me. Without hesitation, I scooped her up and carried her to the bedroom.

As for the attacker? This was a high-end neighborhood. Cameras would catch him.

The moment I laid her down, she clung to me.

Pregnancy had made her curves even more pronounced. The soft warmth pressed against me sent my pulse racing.

My mind flashed back to that glimpse in the bathroom—the pink peaks atop those full, pale mounds. It had haunted my dreams for nights. With no girlfriend, I’d had to rely on hand relief.

Now here she was, the woman from my fantasies, in my arms. Heat surged through me.

I quickly eased back, putting space between us.

"Don’t worry," I reassured her. "They’ll catch him."

Then, to my surprise, Vanessa begged me to stay the night. She was terrified the man would return.

I hesitated. What if her husband or boyfriend showed up? My presence would raise questions.

"He wouldn’t care," she said bitterly. "He barely visits."

Her voice turned pleading. "Please, just this once. I’m alone here. If that monster comes back… I can’t defend myself."

How could I say no?

I agreed.

That night, I slept in the room next to Vanessa's. Just as I was drifting off, dizzy with exhaustion, I thought I heard the sound of a woman's moans from next door—each one louder than the last.

Faintly, I even heard someone calling my name.

Then, a soft, warm body slithered into my arms like a snake.
###Chapter 4.

What man could resist such tender, voluptuous curves?

I let instinct take over, reveling in the pliant softness beneath me. Unlike before, when only a towel had separated us, this time her supple flesh swayed like rippling water, filling my palms as I grasped her tightly.

Her breathy moans filled my ears, her skin slick against my touch.

It all felt like a dream—yet not quite.

The feverish heat of her made me curse under my breath. Damn, this dream feels way too fucking real.

Just as I was about to take her, ready to lose myself, I suddenly saw a figure standing by the bed.

Ryan.

He was staring at me with a vicious, murderous glare—like I was already dead.

I jolted upright in terror, my back drenched in sweat.

Sunlight streamed through the beige curtains, casting the room in a hazy glow. It felt like waking from a vivid nightmare.

Was that a dream? It felt so real. I muttered to myself, still in bed.

For some reason, an uneasy feeling settled in my chest—something I couldn’t quite explain, just a nagging sense of dread.

That morning, Vanessa insisted I stay, saying she wanted to cook me a meal as thanks.

I waved her off, telling her it was no trouble at all.

But she wouldn’t take no for an answer. Unable to refuse, I finally agreed.

Honestly, I was curious whether a wealthy woman like her could even cook.

The moment I said yes, she lit up and got to work, telling me to relax on the couch while she prepared the meal.

Soon, rich aromas wafted from the kitchen, making my mouth water.

I’d assumed a pampered socialite like Vanessa wouldn’t know her way around a kitchen, but she turned out to be surprisingly skilled.

"Wash up—dinner’s ready!" she called out.

She stood there in an apron, her eyes crinkling with a smile. For a fleeting moment, it almost felt... domestic.

I hadn’t been home since moving to the city. Even though there wasn’t much waiting for me there, home was still home. I’d mentioned wanting to visit a few times, but Ryan always shut me down, saying I’d be better off practicing my massage techniques instead.

Lost in thought, I snapped back to reality as Vanessa carried the dishes over.

I hurried to help—no way was I letting a pregnant woman do all the work.

Once everything was on the table, I gave an enthusiastic thumbs-up. "Wow, this looks amazing!"

Vanessa smiled shyly. "I hope it tastes okay. Try it."

I immediately picked up my fork and took a bite, playing it up. "Delicious. Seriously good."

"Then eat as much as you want," she beamed, urging me to help myself.

After the meal, she insisted I rest a while before leaving—the heat outside was brutal.

My head still felt foggy, so I agreed.

As I lay in bed, Vanessa suddenly appeared before me.

Without a word, she slipped under the covers.

Her full, cool body pressed against mine, igniting my desire instantly.

"Please... just once," she begged, her fingers already working at her clothes. "My husband’s never home. I can’t take it anymore."

In seconds, she was naked against me, then started pulling at my clothes.

"No—you’re pregnant," I protested weakly, trying to gently push her away.

But she only pressed closer, her hand sliding down my body. I hissed as her lips brushed my ear. "It’s fine after the first trimester. Just... be gentle."

What man could resist that?

And my body burned like wildfire, as if consumed by flames.

Afterward, Vanessa lay curled against me, fast asleep.

I’d tried to be careful, but it had been too long—I couldn’t hold back.

Once I was sure she was deep asleep, I carried her back to her room, tucked her in, and left.
###Chapter 5

Ryan wasn’t at the rental when I arrived.

Only the other masseur was there. I casually asked where Ryan had gone.

The masseur said Ryan went to see his girlfriend. Apparently, she was pregnant too—though he’d never met her. Ryan had only mentioned her once or twice in passing.

Hearing that, I frowned.

Ryan and I weren’t just cousins—we were from the same village. How could he have a girlfriend and not tell me?

Then again, we weren’t particularly close. It wasn’t surprising he’d kept it to himself. Honestly, it saved me the trouble of pretending to care.

Just when I thought the mess with Vanessa was over, Ryan texted me.

Attached was an explicit photo.

Of me and Vanessa.

Her eyes were closed as I pinned her down, her face twisted in pain.

If I weren’t the one in the picture, even I would’ve believed she’d been forced.

I shot to my feet, blood boiling.

Ryan’s call came next. "Cousin, this isn’t right. Raping your own brother’s pregnant girlfriend? If this gets out, your life is over."

I gritted my teeth. "What do you want?"

"You know what. Sign the property transfer agreement, and this disappears."

"No fucking way. That house was left to me by my father. I’m not giving it to you."

"Don’t be like that. Even if you refuse, you’ll still have to pay for the medical bills. The poor girl’s fetus is unstable from the trauma."

His smug tone made me see red.

Three months ago, he’d promised to help me make money. Instead, I’d blown through my savings on training. Now, just as I was about to start earning, he pulled this shit.

"Go to hell. I’d rather die than sign anything."

I hung up.

Sure enough, the police arrested me soon after.

The photo of Vanessa and me looked damning—like I’d forced her.

Then there was her testimony, backed by Ryan. And the DNA evidence.

On the surface, it was an open-and-shut rape case.

The fact that Vanessa was pregnant only made it more believable. What kind of expectant mother would risk her baby to frame someone?

At the station, female officers shot me disgusted looks. How could anyone be so depraved? Raping his own pregnant cousin’s wife and acting so calm about it.

Ryan even played the gracious victim, telling the cops I’d just "acted on impulse."

"Vanessa’s baby is at risk now. All we want is compensation—medical expenses, that’s all."

How noble of him.

And conveniently, he already had a solution: signing over my family’s property.

The detective slid the photo across the table. "Anything to say?"

I laughed.

Because I’d known this was a setup from the start.

I’d suspected Ryan and Vanessa were working together.

At first, I didn’t think much of her calling him "Ryan" on the phone. It made sense—he was well-known in the industry, with great client reviews.

But her "damsel in distress" act tipped me off. She’d staged the whole thing to keep me there.

She’d forgotten a few crucial details, though.

Her house had no lived-in feel—like a short-term rental.

The gated community had strict security. No one could enter without resident approval.

Yet conveniently, her place got robbed that day. And she’d stopped me from chasing the intruder.

Not how a real victim would react.

The final clue? A call from the village committee.

Our hometown was being demolished. Every household would get a hefty payout.

After my parents died, I was the only one left. The village couldn’t reach me—until Ryan "kindly" offered to pass along the news.

Now that the demolition was approved, contracts needed signing.

Every time I’d tried to visit home, Ryan had made excuses. He’d had his eye on my property all along.

Of course, it was just speculation. I had no proof.

Until that night at Vanessa’s.

I’d secretly recorded everything.

Turns out, I hadn’t dreamed Ryan standing over my bed. I’d woken just in time, scaring the hell out of them.

The next morning, I checked the footage.

Vanessa had drugged my water.

At dinner, she tried again. This time, I played along. A free ride was a free ride—and I’d never been with a pregnant woman before.

……

The lab results came back.

My DNA was inside her.

Ryan smirked when the cops weren’t looking, mouthing "Serves you right."

I turned to Vanessa. "Did I really rape you?"

She didn’t flinch. "Yes. The report proves it. What else is there to say?"

"Because of you, my baby might not make it. I’ll need hospitalization, and who knows how much more after birth."

I sighed. I’d wanted to give her one last chance to come clean.

But she doubled down.

Fine.

I played the recording.

A man and woman’s voices filled the room.

"Are you sure the dosage is enough?"

"Plenty. I got this from India—top-shelf stuff."

"Is his village really being demolished? Don’t screw this up. I’m only doing this for you."

"It’s happening. Once I get his signature, the money’s ours. Then we send him to prison—your revenge."

"Fine. But we’re getting married the second the cash hits."

Ryan lunged for the report, shoving it at the cops. "This is fake! The lab results don’t lie!"

Vanessa raised her voice. "Exactly! He’s lying! Why would I risk my baby like this?"

"You’re a monster! Targeting your own family—I’m carrying your nephew!"

I burst out laughing.

Vanessa was beautiful, but rotten to the core.

Did my idiot cousin really think that baby was his?

Oh well. Let him believe it.

The truth was, Ryan had been a cuckold for who knew how long.

While Vanessa cooked, I’d found a phone full of her hookup messages.

Not that Ryan was any better.

A fuckboy and a slut—perfect for each other.
###Chapter 6.

The police took the video for forensic analysis.

The results came back quickly—the footage hadn't been spliced or edited in any way.

Vanessa and Ryan were completely stunned.

Ryan struck first, immediately throwing all the blame onto Vanessa.

"It was all her idea! She kept nagging about me being broke and came up with this stupid plan."

"The drugging? That was all her. I just helped a little."

"Officer, my part isn't that serious, right?"

Vanessa exploded with rage, jabbing a finger at Ryan's face.

"If you hadn't lied about your family's compensation money from the demolition, I never would've gotten involved with you! Now you're pinning everything on me?"

"Officer, I want to report Ryan for soliciting prostitution."

"I have proof."

It was a spectacular display of dog-eat-dog. If we weren't in a police station, I would've applauded.

My own innocence was confirmed. As for them? Not my problem anymore.

I'd done everything I could. The rest was up to the authorities.

In the end, Vanessa avoided serious consequences due to her pregnancy. Ryan, however, faced several years behind bars.
###Chapter 7.

I later heard Vanessa went to our village with her swollen belly to find the Roscentes.

She'd grown accustomed to reckless spending during her time with Ryan and couldn't break the habit.

At first, the Roscentes tolerated her because of the baby she carried.

But then rumors spread through the village—about the disgusting things Ryan and Vanessa had done, whispers that she was nothing but a slut, that the child might not even be Ryan's.

Ryan's mother was furious, blaming Vanessa for her son's imprisonment. Life in the village must have been hell for her.

And with that belly, she couldn't easily escape.

Years later, when the village was set for demolition, I returned for a visit.

From a distance, I saw a woman being dragged by her hair, beaten to the ground, her clothes torn and barely covering her body.

It wasn’t until I got closer that I recognized her—Vanessa.

She looked nothing like the seductive woman she once was. I barely knew it was her.

Only when I saw Ryan’s mother delivering the blows did the pieces click.

Vanessa noticed me then. Hatred burned in her eyes, her teeth clenched, her gaze venomous.

The last I heard of them was on a crime documentary.

They’d gone back to their scams.

This time, they were facing over a decade behind bars.

As for me? I went back to being a masseur.
