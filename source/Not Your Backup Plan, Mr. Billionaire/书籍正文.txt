###Chapter 1

Everyone in their circle knew Sophia Sullivan was hopelessly devoted to Ethan Roscente.

Her life revolved entirely around him.

Every time they broke up, she would come crawling back within three days.

Anyone else might call it quits, but never Sophia.

The private room fell silent when Ethan walked in with his new flame.

Sophia was peeling an orange. Her hands stilled.

"Why did everyone stop talking?" She looked up.

Her friend shot her a worried glance.

Ethan acted oblivious, settling on the couch with the woman.

"Happy birthday, Charlie."

He flashed a careless smile.

Sophia stood up.

It was Charlie Lowell's birthday. She didn't want to make a scene.

"I'm going to the restroom."

As the door closed, she caught snippets of conversation.

"Ethan, Sophia's here. Why did you bring someone else?"

"Roscente, that's too far."

"Doesn't matter." Ethan lit a cigarette, smoke curling around him.

He smiled, the picture of a carefree playboy.

Sophia didn't hear the rest.

She stood before the bathroom mirror, studying her reflection.

A bitter smile touched her lips.

"Pathetic."

Her life was a joke.

She took a deep breath and made a decision.

Returning to the private room, she froze in the doorway.

Ethan was playing Spin the Bottle with the woman, using a napkin.

The crowd cheered and laughed.

"Roscente, you dog!"

"Kiss! Kiss!"

Sophia's fists clenched, her knuckles white.

This was the man she had loved for six years.

The irony was suffocating.

"Stop it…" someone whispered.

All eyes turned to the door.

"Sophia, it's just a game…"

Ethan cut them off, his gaze cool. "Since you're here, let's make this clear."

"Go on."

"This back-and-forth is tiresome. The spark between us is gone."

Sophia dug her nails into her palm, feeling nothing.

Six years, reduced to a faded spark.

"Isabella is a good woman. I want to be serious with her."

Sophia nodded numbly. "Fine."

"Even if we're over, we can still be friends. Let me know if you need anything."

"Unnecessary." Sophia gave a hollow laugh. "A clean break is better for everyone."

Ethan raised an eyebrow, surprised.

"Happy birthday, Charlie." She turned to him. "I'm leaving. Share the oranges. Don't waste them."

Ethan only ate oranges if every bit of white pith was removed.

For years, she had peeled them, removed every shred of pith, arranged them on a plate, and served him.

When he was pleased, he would pull her close and whisper.

"My girlfriend is the best. So domestic."

"Want me to marry you?"

He always knew what she wanted but never gave it.

Ethan said, "Let the driver take you."

"No need. I called a car."

Charlie offered, "Let me drive you, Sophia."

She waved him off and left.

"Ethan, she's really angry this time."

"Unlikely. She always comes back."

"I give it five days."

"I say six."

Ethan watched the open door, his voice cold. "She'll be back begging in three hours."

"You win, Ethan. Everyone knows she's crazy about you."

"Why don't women worship me like that?"

"You? Don't make me laugh."

…

She returned to the Beverly Hills mansion after midnight.

It only took thirty minutes to pack her life into one suitcase.

She left behind all the designer clothes and jewelry in the walk-in closet.

The only regret was the wall of professional books.

Fortunately, their contents were in her mind. The books themselves were replaceable.

In the dressing table drawer lay a check and a contract.

A check for 7.2 million USD. A land deed for the East郊 plot.

Worth over ten million.

Ethan had tossed them there during a previous breakup, already signed.

He was certain she wouldn't take them. Taking them meant it was truly over.

Six years for ten million?

Sophia didn't think it was a bad deal.

How many women's youth was worth that much?

She packed the documents into her bag.

She had given him her all. Why shouldn't she take it?

The love was gone. At least there was money.

She wasn't a naive romantic who scorns wealth.

"Housekeeping service? Do you handle urgent jobs?"

"...Yes, a deep clean. I'll pay extra."

Sophia left the keys in the foyer and took a cab to her best friend's place.

The cleaning service called to confirm on the way.

"Miss, you don't want any of these items?"

"No. Dispose of them."

The call ended.

Ethan returned home in the early hours. The cleaners were long gone.

The cloying scent of perfume gave him a headache. He loosened his tie and collapsed on the sofa, falling asleep.

He woke up to the sound of dishes clattering in the kitchen.

Rubbing his temples, he reached for a water glass but found empty air.

She was back, had covered him with a blanket, but forgotten his hangover cure?

Was she still playing these petty games?

He got up.

"You'd better…"

"Awake, young master?"

"Martha?"

"Freshen up. Breakfast is almost ready. Were you cold? I turned up the heat and added a blanket."

"...Yeah."
###Chapter 2

At the dining table.

Ethan Roscente put down his chopsticks.
"No oatmeal porridge?"

"You mean the stomach-soothing kind?"
"Stomach-soothing?"

"Yes, the kind Miss Sophia often made."
"Millet, Chinese yam, lily bulbs, and jujubes."
"It's very time-consuming."
"The ingredients need to be soaked overnight."
"You have to get up early to stew it."

"The heat control is particularly tricky."
"I'm not as careful as Miss Sophia."
"I can't replicate that flavor..."

Ethan said, "Get the salsa."

"Coming right up."

"...This tastes wrong." He glanced at the jar.
"The packaging is different too."

"The previous one was finished. This is all we have."
"Go to the supermarket and buy two jars."

"You can't buy it."

"?"

Martha laughed awkwardly.
"Miss Sophia made this herself. I don't know how..."

Clatter!

"Young Master, are you done eating?"

"Hmm."

Martha watched the man's retreating back as he went upstairs, her face full of confusion.

Why was he suddenly upset?

...

"Lazybones! Get up!"

Sophia Sullivan rolled over, eyes still closed.
"Stop it, let me sleep a bit longer..."

Olivia Lopez, finished with her makeup, was choosing a bag.
"It's almost eight. Aren't you going back to make breakfast for his highness, Mr. Roscente?"

Before, when Sophia stayed over, she would rush back before dawn.
Just to make that nourishing porridge for Ethan's sensitive stomach.

Olivia had always found it ridiculous.
Did Ethan Roscente not have hands or a phone?
How hard was it to order takeout?

It was a habit born purely from being spoiled!

Sophia, deep in sleep, waved a hand.
"Not going back. We broke up."

"Oh. How many days will this breakup last?"

"..."

"Sleep then. Breakfast is on the table."
"I'm off to work."
"I have a date tonight, so don't cook for me..."
"Actually, you'll probably leave soon anyway."
"Remember to close the balcony window."

Sophia woke up from hunger.

Eating the sandwich her best friend made, watching the brilliant sunshine outside the window, she couldn't remember the last time she'd slept in naturally.

She finished the breakfast-turned-lunch, changed clothes, and headed straight for the bank.

First, to cash the check for 7.2 million USD.
She'd feel secure only once the money was in her account.

Then she went to the bank next door.
"I need to speak with your private banker. I want to deposit one million."

The branch manager personally attended to her.
He offered a decent interest rate.
Sophia requested an additional two percentage points.
They finally reached an agreement.

She repeated the process at two other banks, depositing one million at each.
The interest rates got better each time.

Stepping out of the last bank, Sophia was now a woman of considerable means.
She held Black Cards from three banks.
She had three million in various deposits.
And two million in liquid cash.

"This breakup was worth it."

It was like striking it rich overnight.

Passing a bustling hair salon, Sophia pushed the door open.

She immediately signed up for a two-thousand-dollar membership, securing priority service.

Sitting before the mirror, looking at her head of brown curls, she found them irritating for the first time.

"Miss, your hair texture is wonderful, just like a doll's..."

She had kept it curly because Ethan liked long hair.
After every intimate moment, his hand would always weave through her curls.

But beautiful curls meant spending huge amounts of time on upkeep.

Sophia smiled slightly.
"Cut it short. Straighten it. Dye it black."

No matter how beautiful a doll was, it was still just a toy.
Let someone else play that role. She was done.

Leaving the salon, Sophia felt light and free.
A nearby Uniqlo was having a sale.
She went in, bought a white T-shirt and jeans, and changed into them on the spot.

They went perfectly with her sneakers today.

Walking aimlessly, she found herself outside the gates of MIT.
Watching students cycling in and out under the setting sun, Sophia was lost in thought.

"Senior Henry! Over here—"

A young man brushed past Sophia.
"Why is everyone here?"

"We all wanted to visit Professor Watson, so..."
Henry Lorenz said, "The hospital won't allow this many people in."
"Let two representatives from the bioinformatics program come with me."

Bioinformatics... Professor Watson...

Sophia's eyes sharpened.
She quickened her pace and stepped forward.
"Who did you say is sick?"

Henry Lorenz stammered slightly at the clean, pretty girl before him.
"P-Professor Watson."

"Eleanor Watson?"

"Yes."

"Which hospital?"

"Massachusetts General."

"Thank you."

"Uh... which department are you from, junior?"
"Were you also Professor Watson's student?"

The boy's question was left behind as Sophia strode away.

Back at the apartment, Sophia's mood remained unsettled for a long time.

That feisty little old lady who would jump up and rap your knuckles when angry was sick?

How serious was it?

She opened her contacts, found the number labeled "Fang Yanqing," hesitated several times, but ultimately lacked the courage to dial.

Back then, to be with Ethan Roscente, for so-called love, she had given up her spot in the combined Master's and Ph.D. program without a second thought.

She hadn't worked a single day after graduating with her bachelor's, turning herself into a homemaker revolving around a man.

The old professor must have been utterly disappointed.

"Hey? You're still here, Sophia?" Olivia Lopez said, surprised, while changing her shoes.

Sophia's mouth twitched.
"What? Trying to kick me out?"

"Tsk tsk, truly rare. You're holding out longer this time."
"I remember last time you broke up with Ethan Roscente, it wasn't even half an hour before he called, and you obediently went back."

"There's porridge in the pot. Serve yourself."

Olivia's eyes lit up.
She immediately ran to the kitchen and served a bowl.
As she drank, she sighed.
"That dog, Ethan Roscente, was so lucky, getting to drink this every day..."

Sophia said, "Remember to wash the bowl and the pot after you finish. Clean up properly. I'm going to sleep first."

"Hey, you're really not going back?"

The response was the sound of the bedroom door closing.

Olivia clicked her tongue lightly.
"Making progress this time..."

Under the same night sky, at the Beverly Hills mansion.

"Mr. Roscente, the bank confirmed it."
"Miss Sullivan personally cashed the check for 7.2 million USD."
"The time was 12:05 PM today..."

Ethan Roscente hung up the phone, coldly gazing at the night view outside the window.

"Sophia Sullivan, what game are you playing now?"

If she thought using this method could win him back, she was sorely mistaken.

Once he decided something, there was no room for discussion.

"Charlie, want to grab a drink?"

Half an hour later, Ethan pushed open the private room door.
Charlie Lowell was the first to greet him with a smile.
"Ethan, everyone's here, just waiting for you."
"What are we drinking tonight?"

Ethan walked inside.

Charlie didn't move, looking behind him.

"What are you standing there for?"

"Where's Sophia? Parking the car?"

Ethan's face darkened.
###Chapter 3

Charlie Lowell poked his head into the private room.

Ethan Roscente was the only one inside.

"Ethan, where's Sophia? Isn't she with you?"

Ethan looked up.

His gaze was cold enough to freeze a person solid.

Charlie immediately shut his mouth.

Right. He shouldn't have asked.

Julian Winston walked over, swirling his glass.

"The three-hour bet is now a day overdue. Do you concede, Ethan?"

Ethan gave a slight smirk.

"What's the forfeit?"

"No drinking today." Julian's smile was meaningful. "Call Sophia. Use your gentlest voice and say: 'Baby, I'm sorry. I love you.'"

The room erupted in laughter.

Charlie was quick. He snatched Ethan's phone, found Sophia Sullivan's number, and dialed.

"Ring—"

The call connected.

But the next second, a mechanical female voice sounded. "We're sorry. The number you have dialed is currently unavailable…"

Charlie froze.

Julian raised an eyebrow.

Ethan's expression darkened.

Charlie forced a dry laugh. "Maybe Sophia's busy… Should I try again?"

He dialed a second time.

It went straight to a busy signal.

Cold sweat broke out on Charlie's brow.

"It's… probably just a bad signal?"

Julian chuckled lightly. "Clearly, you've been blocked."

Charlie: "…"

Ethan took his phone back.

The screen went dark.

His face showed no emotion.

"Breaking up isn't a joke. From now on, if anyone mentions Sophia Sullivan again, don't blame me for turning on you."

Julian studied him for a few seconds.

"I hope you won't regret this."

Ethan scoffed.

Regret?

Those two words had never existed in his life.

…

Seven in the morning.

Olivia Lopez returned from her morning run.

She smelled something delicious the moment she opened the door.

Sophia was coming out of the kitchen, holding a bowl of oatmeal porridge.

She wore a houndstooth dress with her hair in a high ponytail. Even without makeup, she was stunningly beautiful.

"Go shower, then eat."

Olivia blinked. "New look? The long black hair is nice… Did Ethan ask you to change it?"

Sophia shot her a look.

"Can't you think of something positive?"

"Isn't him coming to pick you up a good thing?" Olivia leaned over the dining table. "Wow, such a feast?"

Her hand darted out to grab some food, but was swiftly slapped away.

"Your hands are dirty. Go shower first."

"Tch, double standards! You never said that when Ethan used his hands."

"I'll definitely scold him next time I get the chance."

"Yeah, right…"

By the time Olivia finished her shower, Sophia was already heading out the door with an insulated lunchbox.

"She said she made breakfast for me, but it's really for a man… Prioritizing romance over friendship…"

…

VIP ward at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Professor Eleanor Watson was reading a thesis, her reading glasses perched on her nose.

Professor Benjamin Murphy pushed the door open.

"Eleanor! How are you feeling? Any better?"

"Benjamin? What brings you here?" Eleanor quickly sat up. "It was just a minor surgery. The doctors insisted I stay this long…"

"Appendicitis is no small matter. You're not as young as you used to be, recovery is slower." Benjamin adjusted her pillows. "This year's postgraduate quotas are out. You get three. I get four."

"Three…" Eleanor murmured.

"Still only planning to take two?"

"Yes. I can't handle more."

Benjamin pursed his lips.

She was clearly saving that spot. So stubborn.

Henry Lorenz entered with two junior students.

"Professor Watson. Professor Murphy." They placed down fruit and flowers. "We came to see you."

During the casual chat, one junior suddenly said, "I heard there's a freshman this year who's amazing. She got directly admitted to the combined Master's and Ph.D. program."

In MIT's School of Life Sciences, there had been fewer than three direct-admit Ph.D. students in the past decade.

"Gold medals in last year's International Math and Computer Science Olympiads. Direct admission to our school."

"Two gold medals? That's good, I guess. But I remember a senior, one of Professor Watson's students. When she entered, she had four gold medals! A full sweep in math, physics, chemistry, and computer science! Her name was… Sophia? Sophia Sullivan?"

"It's getting late!" Benjamin suddenly interrupted. "You should head back to campus now."

The students exchanged confused looks but said their goodbyes and left.

The ward fell quiet.

Eleanor's lips trembled. Tears slid down her cheeks.

"A genius like that… it shouldn't be like this… Why didn't she cherish her gift?"

Benjamin sighed. "Don't get upset…"

"The last time I saw her, she said she wanted love… Ha! Love… She broke my heart…"

Sophia stood outside the hospital room door.

Her grip on the insulated lunchbox was so tight her knuckles were white.

Tears fell silently.

I'm sorry, Professor…

In the end, she still didn't have the courage to go in.

She left the lunchbox at the nurses' station.

"Please give this to Professor Watson. Thank you."

The nurse looked up. "Could you please fill out a form…"

But Sophia had already turned and run away.

She rushed outside the inpatient building.

Fresh air filled her lungs, but the suffocating guilt remained.

"Sophia?"

A familiar voice.

Amelia Roscente walked over in high heels.

Dressed in professional attire, carrying a Lady Dior bag, she looked intelligent and capable.

Ethan's sister.

"What are you doing at the hospital?" She looked Sophia over. "Not the maternity ward, I hope?"

She secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

If Sophia were pregnant, their mother, Victoria Roscente, would be furious.

"Amelia." Sophia managed a weak smile.

"Your eyes are so red? Have you been crying?"

Sophia was silent.

"Did you fight with my brother again?"

"No."

Amelia's eyes held sympathy.

She actually liked Sophia quite a bit.

Pretty, good personality.

A shame she didn't meet the Roscente family's standards.

Especially Victoria, who only wanted a top-school, high-achieving daughter-in-law.

"My brother has a terrible temper. You just have to be more patient."

Sophia said softly, "We've already bro—"

"Oh, I'm in a rush. Let's chat next time."

Amelia glanced at her watch and hurried into the inpatient building.

Today, she was here to visit Professor Watson.

Her chance at the direct Ph.D. admission depended on this.
###Chapter 4

He drank too much last night.

Charlie insisted on going to another bar.

They didn't call it a night until the early hours.

Ethan was driven back to his Beverly Hills mansion by his chauffeur.

The sky was already turning pale with the approaching dawn.

He was so tired his eyelids felt heavy.

He forced himself to stagger to the shower.

Clara probably won't nag now.

He thought drowsily.

He woke up again, startled by a sharp pain in his stomach.

"Ugh…" He sat up, pressing a hand to his abdomen.

"My stomach hurts! Mi—"

He cut his own call short mid-name.

Ethan frowned deeply.

She's showing some backbone this time.

Fine.

Let's see how long you can keep this up.

But where is the medicine?

Ethan ransacked every cabinet in the living room.

He couldn't find the first aid kit anywhere.

He called Martha.

"Stomach medicine? It's in the first aid kit."

A vein throbbed at Ethan's temple. "Where is the kit?"

"In the bedroom walk-in closet drawer. Miss Sophia stocked several boxes. She said you often get stomachaches after drinking, so it's convenient to keep it in the bedroom…"

"Hello? Young master? Why did you hang up…"

Ethan walked into the walk-in closet.

He found the first aid kit in the drawer, just as Martha said.

Beneath it, five boxes of stomach medicine were neatly arranged.

All were the brand he usually took.

The pain eased after he took the medicine.

His nerves gradually relaxed.

As he absently pushed the drawer shut, his movement suddenly halted.

All the jewelry and luxury handbags were still there.

But all of Sophia's identification documents were gone.

Her ID card, passport, degree certificates, graduation diplomas—all vanished.

One of the suitcases from the corner was missing too.

Ethan stood frozen on the spot.

Blinding rage instantly shot to his head.

"Good… very good… just wonderful…"

He said the word "good" three times.

A cold smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth.

Women truly shouldn't be spoiled.

The more you indulge them, the worse their temper gets.

The sound of a door opening suddenly came from downstairs.

Ethan immediately went down.

"...Why is it you?"

Amelia was changing her shoes. She looked up at his question. "Who else were you expecting?"

Ethan walked to the sofa and sat down, his tone cold. "What do you want?"

"Martha said your stomach was acting up. Mom sent me to check on her dear brother."

Amelia headed towards the kitchen as she spoke. "And to mooch some lunch."

One reason she liked Sophia was because she was a great cook.

Half a minute later—

"Bro! Why is the kitchen cold and empty?"

"Where's Sophia? Not home today? That doesn't seem right…"

She should have already prepared a meal by this time.

If she was lucky, she could usually snag a meal for herself too.

Sophia again.

Ethan rubbed his temples, not wanting to talk.

Amelia came out of the kitchen, disappointed. "Is she not feeling well? Her complexion looked terrible at the hospital yesterday…"

"...You saw her at the hospital?" Ethan suddenly sat up straight.

"Yeah, I went to Massachusetts General Hospital to see Professor Watson yesterday. Ran into her right at the entrance of the inpatient building. Bro! Professor Watson agreed to give me the direct Ph.D. placement!"

The man frowned. "What was she doing at the hospital?"

"How would I know if you don't?"

Ethan fell silent.

"Maybe she wasn't sick? Visiting someone? But she doesn't really have any friends, does she? Her life pretty much just revolves around you…"

"Are you done?"

Amelia was taken aback.

"If you're done, leave. I need to catch up on sleep." Ethan stood up.

"You're kicking me out just like that? Fine!" Amelia huffed, putting her shoes back on. "I came today with a mission, you know."

Ethan walked straight upstairs.

"Tomorrow, two PM, The French Laundry. Mom set up a blind date for you. Don't be late!"

"Nag."

Amelia stuck her tongue out at his retreating back.

She was used to these kinds of arrangements.

Her brother being with Sophia never really affected these marriage alliances.

He'd attended plenty of these setups over the years.

Most were just formalities to placate their mother.

After shooing Amelia away, Ethan went to his study to work.

In his early years, he started his own business to break free from the family's control.

The first three years were incredibly tough.

He refused any help from home.

Only Sophia was by his side.

His company only began to thrive in the last two years.

He finally shed the label of a spoiled, good-for-nothing rich heir.

The family's attitude softened instead.

They began actively seeking closer ties with him.

Their stance on his relationship with Sophia shifted from opposition to turning a blind eye.

By the time he finished work, it was evening.

Dusk gathered outside the window, and the city lights began to twinkle.

Ethan felt hungry.

He took out his phone and called his girlfriend. "...What are you up to?"

The ringtone sounded first, followed by the girl's hushed voice. "Sorry, baby, I'm in class. I'll find you after it's over, okay?"

The term 'baby' made Ethan uncomfortable. "Yeah. You're busy."

He hung up directly and tossed the phone aside.

Half a minute later, the phone rang again.

Ethan ignored it and continued working.

He only left the study when his stomach protested again with another pang of hunger.

He made plans to have dinner with Charlie.

Ethan changed clothes and was about to head out.

A girl at the door turned around sharply at the sound.

Her smile was pure and slightly shy.

"Isabella?"

"Sorry, I knocked but you didn't answer, so I decided to wait here." She glanced at the suit jacket draped over his arm. "Are you going out?"

Ethan frowned. "How did you find this place?"

Isabella's eyes darted away. "I asked one of your friends…"

"Charlie?"

"No, it was Julian."

Ethan said, "Come in first."

A smile touched the girl's eyes. She bounced inside, looking around. "You hung up and then didn't answer… I was so worried…"

Ethan asked, "Weren't you supposed to be in class?"

"I skipped. My boyfriend is more important."

Sophia never did that.

When he was pursuing her, she was a freshman with a heavy course load.

She never skipped or missed a class for him.

Later, after they got together and she was a senior with fewer classes,

she slowly found more time to spend with him.

"Baby, you haven't eaten, right? I—"

"Do you know how to make oatmeal porridge?" Ethan suddenly asked.

"...Oatmeal porridge?"

"Yes."

"No, but I can learn."

…

He politely declined Isabella's hints about staying the night.

Ethan ate the takeout she had brought.

He drove her back to Caltech.

Then he went to meet Charlie.

While waiting at a red light, he checked his phone.

He remembered Amelia saying she saw Sophia at the hospital.

Even though they were broken up.

There were so many years of history between them.

Even as ordinary friends, he should show some concern.

He opened WeChat—

[Are you sick?]

[sym has enabled friend verification. You are not yet friends. Please send a friend request first…]

###Chapter 5

Ethan Roscente threw back his head and downed the strong liquor.

The glass hit the table with a heavy thud.

Charlie Lowell leaned closer to Julian Winston. "Is Ethan in a bad mood?"

Julian's lips curved into a smirk. "Someone blocked him."

Before the words fully faded.

Ethan's gaze turned icy.

"Shut up."

He yanked at his collar, a dark fury brewing between his brows.

The private room fell silent instantly.

Charlie choked, coughing.

Sebastian Evans asked quietly, "Did Sophia Sullivan go back?"

Charlie shook his head.

A bartender brought new drinks.

Someone suggested playing Truth or Dare.

The door was pushed open.

Chloe Sullivan walked in.

She was nudged toward Ethan.

"Mr. Roscente…"

Ethan stood up abruptly.

"Have fun."

He left without another word.

Chloe Sullivan stood frozen in place.

...

The driver asked for a destination.

Ethan massaged his temples.

"To the office."

His assistant was about to leave for the day.

He looked surprised to see Ethan.

"Mr. Roscente?"

A sharp pain twisted in Ethan's stomach.

"Buy some porridge."

The assistant quickly returned with seafood congee.

Ethan frowned.

He only took two bites before putting the spoon down.

He thought of Sophia's oatmeal porridge.

Irritated, he pushed the container away.

...

Sophia Sullivan turned on the apartment lights.

The intimate sounds stopped abruptly.

Olivia Lopez was in a silk nightgown.

She was entangled with a young man.

The couch was a mess.

Sophia turned around.

"Get yourselves together first."

Olivia adjusted her strap.

She threw on a robe.

She tossed the man's jacket to him.

"Wait for me in the bedroom."

The man smiled at Sophia.

"Good evening."

Sophia responded instinctively.

Olivia sipped her red wine and corrected him. "His name is Steven."

Sophia poured water, distracted.

Olivia noticed her red-rimmed eyes.

"You've been crying?"

Sophia said softly, "I went to see Professor Eleanor Watson."

Olivia raised an eyebrow.

"How is the professor?"

Sophia shook her head.

"I didn't dare go in."

Olivia laughed in disbelief.

"You're such a coward."

She saw the stubborn set of Sophia's jaw.

She understood the breakfast was for the professor.

"What are you planning to do?"

Sophia looked up.

"Will you come with me to see the professor?"

Olivia narrowed her eyes.

"What are you trying to do?"
###Chapter 6

The glass door of The French Laundry swung open.

Sophia Sullivan walked in.

She was two minutes early.

A waiter led her through the hallway.

A man by the window was drinking coffee.

White shirt, gold-rimmed glasses.

Sunlight fell on his profile.

Like a carefully painted portrait.

Sophia looked down at herself.

White t-shirt, jeans.

No makeup, high ponytail.

It was too casual.

The man turned his head.

"Sit."

His voice was deep and magnetic.

Sophia pulled out a chair.

"Sorry to keep you waiting."

Alexander Laurent adjusted his glasses.

"I just arrived."

He glanced at his watch.

"I have data to process at the lab."

"I can only give you thirty minutes today."

Sophia nodded.

"That's enough."

The waiter brought lemon water.

Alexander got straight to the point.

"What do you need from me to see Professor Watson?"

Sophia gripped her cup.

"The professor was discharged from the hospital."

"I don't know her address."

"I hope you can take me to visit her."

She paused.

"If the professor gets angry…"

"Please help calm her down."

The corner of Alexander's mouth lifted slightly.

"Alright."

"Let's schedule it for two days from now."

Sophia breathed a sigh of relief.

"Thank you."

She suddenly looked up.

"Why are you willing to help me?"

Alexander's gaze was profound.

"Because you are Sophia Sullivan."

He slowly set down his coffee cup.

"Professor Watson once said."

"She has three regrets in life."

"Her research career was too short."

"She has no children."

"And—"

He looked at her.

"Sophia Sullivan."

Sophia's fingertips turned white.

Her throat felt dry.

Alexander handed her a note.

A string of numbers was written on it.

The handwriting was neat and elegant.

...

Not far away.

Ethan Roscente toyed with a lighter.

The woman opposite him chattered incessantly.

His eyes were full of impatience.

His gaze swept casually across the room.

It suddenly stopped.

Sophia was sitting opposite a man.

A faint smile was on her face.

Ethan's expression instantly darkened.

He stood up abruptly.

"I have to go."

The woman was stunned.

"But…"

He had already turned and walked away.

...

Alexander was pressed for time.

He stood up exactly thirty minutes later.

Sophia rose as well.

They walked toward the entrance.

Alexander held the door open for her.

"After you."

Sophia smiled and nodded.

"Thank you."

A black car was parked by the curb.

Alexander opened the car door.

"See you the day after tomorrow."

Sophia stood still.

She watched the car drive away.

As she turned.

She collided with a cold stare.

Ethan leaned against the wall.

A mocking sneer played on his lips.

"Found a replacement already?"

###Chapter 7

Ethan Roscente stepped closer.

He finally noticed Sophia Sullivan's signature curls had been straightened.

Even her beloved red hair was dyed back to black.

No makeup.

A plain white t-shirt.

She looked unnaturally clean.

Only her eyes remained startlingly bright.

There was no trace of post-breakup despair.

If this was an act, her performance was flawless.

So good it inexplicably infuriated him.

Sophia frowned.

That expression was all too familiar.

A precursor to his rage.

“Tch.” The man sneereded. “Your taste is truly awful. After being with me for so long, your judgment hasn't improved at all? You'd settle for that trash? Even I, as your ex, feel embarrassed.”

“Embarrassed?” Sophia almost laughed.

Her smile held a trace of bitterness.

Ethan didn't notice.

His mind was filled with the image of Sophia smiling at another man.

The thought agitated him more.

He blamed it on primal male possessiveness.

Sophia was his.

Even if he discarded her, no stray dog had the right to touch her.

“I have things to do. I'm leaving.” Sophia wanted no further entanglement.

“Leave? Where will you go? Back to Olivia Lopez's place? You've learned this time, bringing money and documents. What, planning something big?”

Sophia's heart stung.

She knew he had a terrible temper, was moody.

But hearing it still hurt.

Did he think this was a game?

Sophia took a deep breath, suppressing her emotions.

She forced a smile. “First, Mr. Lopez and I are just friends. It's not the dirty scenario you imagine.”

“Second, we are broken up. Your thoughts are no longer my concern.”

A rideshare car pulled up.

She opened the door and got in. “Driver, please go.”

Ethan's eyes turned icy.

Sophia had really grown a backbone.

Three months ago during a fight, she’d pulled this same stunt.

This time was worse, bringing some random man to provoke him right in front of his face.

Who gave her the nerve?

Suddenly, a pair of soft hands looped through his arm.

Sophia Clementson pressed close, her voice syrupy. “Ethan, you walked so fast, you didn’t wait for me…”

A strong wave of perfume hit him.

Ethan frowned but didn’t push her away. Instead, he pulled her closer by the waist. “What? Want to come with me?”

She could find a man. Couldn’t he find a woman?

In the car.

Sophia watched the embracing couple in the rearview mirror, her lips curling in self-mockery.

So it wasn't just Isabella Langley.

Six years. It was all a wasted effort after all.

The taxi drove away.

Ethan’s expression instantly changed.

He coldly shoved Sophia Clementson away.

Sophia Clementson was stunned, trying to lean in again.

He shoved her forcefully.

The man walked away without a backward glance.

“Ethan! Ethan Roscente! Wait for me!”

The woman stamped her foot in frustration.

Ethan got into his car, started the engine, and directly called Amelia Roscente.

“…Brother? Aren’t you on your date?”

Ethan’s tone was dark. “Did you tell Sophia Sullivan about today’s blind date?”

“Are you out of your mind? Blabbing everything? Mom forced me into this, and instead of covering for me, you tip her off? Letting her find some random man to piss me off? Was that your intention?”

Amelia was yelled into confusion. “Brother, what are you talking about? When did I ever—”

The call was cut off.

She stared at her phone, utterly bewildered.

“…What did I do wrong?”

The butler approached with a gift list. “Miss, please review this.”

Amelia scanned it. All expensive items.

She checked carefully, confirming everything was correct.

“These are for Professor Eleanor Watson. Prepare them meticulously. No mistakes allowed.”

“Understood.”

…

“Miss Sullivan, this is truly the best apartment near MIT. Look at the light, the environment. Many people are competing for it. If you don’t decide now, it’ll be gone.”

The agent pushed hard.

Sophia inspected it thoroughly.

The apartment wasn’t large. Two bedrooms, one living room.

The decor was old. A walk-up.

But the advantages were clear.

Close to MIT, next to the library, convenient transportation.

Good light and environment.

Suitable for a fresh start.

“Okay, I’ll take it.”

She signed a one-year lease directly.

Olivia Lopez returned home to see an open suitcase.

“You’re moving out?”

Sophia was packing clothes. “Yes, found a place.”

Olivia raised an eyebrow. “Did Ethan contact you? Not bad, lasting a whole week this time. Should make him wait,免得 he really thinks he’s some prized catch…”

Sophia stopped, looked at her.

“Vivi, this time it’s real. I’m not going back.”

Olivia was stunned.

Six years.

She’d watched Sophia hide herself away for Ethan, dim her own light, become a shadow orbiting a man.

Worse than a homemaker.

Ethan was simply wasting her.

“Good riddance! Should have done it ages ago! Plenty of men in the world. He’s not special!”

“Yeah.” Sophia nodded.

“So… this is for real? Not going to run back in a couple days?”

“…” Sophia laughed softly.

On her way back, she stopped by the market.

The apartment was old, paint peeling.

The furniture was ancient.

She bought eco-friendly paint, planning to repaint.

“Sir, thank you for your trouble.”

The driver helped her unload the paint cans.

Sophia looked up at the seventh floor.

She had to climb.

To paint, all the furniture needed moving.

She left the door open, hauling the cans up one by one.

The paint was heavy.

Sophia climbed two flights, rested, breathless.

After moving all the cans, she was nearly exhausted.

She rested a few minutes, splashed cold water on her face.

Her strength slowly returned.

She picked up a brush, gauged the wall.

Then—

Rolled up her sleeves, and got to work.
###Chapter 8

Sophia Sullivan hadn't done this kind of work herself in a long time.

During her time with Ethan Roscente, she rarely did any manual labor.

Even during the most difficult early days of his startup, they had a housekeeper who came weekly to clean.

She finished a bucket of paint and straightened her aching back.

She really had been spoiled these past few years.

She walked into the hallway to get the remaining paint.

She accidentally kicked over a bucket.

She righted it immediately, but some had still spilled by her neighbor's door.

She was cleaning it with a mop when the door suddenly opened.

Their eyes met, and both froze.

"You live here?"

"What a coincidence?"

They spoke at the same time.

Alexander Laurent looked down at the floor, then at the apartment behind her.

"You're the one who moved in today?"

Sophia hadn't expected such a coincidence either. "I guess we're neighbors now."

Alexander's gaze shifted slightly.

He chose this place because it was close to the lab and the university.

But why did Sophia choose it?

This environment was clearly unsuitable for a woman living alone. It didn't even have an elevator.

Seeing him stand still, Sophia thought he was bothered by the mess on the floor.

"Sorry, I'll clean it up right away."

She worked faster and soon finished.

On her way downstairs, she noticed a bag of trash by his door.

"I can take that down for you."

He didn't refuse. He turned and brought out a folding ladder from inside.

"This will make painting easier."

"Thank you."

The ladder greatly improved her efficiency.

She finished painting all the peeling walls by noon.

The room instantly looked much tidier.

She then went to a furniture store and picked out a sofa, a table, and chairs.

After some simple arranging, the job was finally done.

By the time she finished, it was almost dark.

Sophia rubbed her sore shoulders and looked around.

Under the warm yellow light, the formerly shabby little apartment looked brand new.

The light-colored cotton duvet cover on the bed smelled faintly of laundry detergent and sunshine.

A row of green plants on the windowsill thrived.

The beanbag chair and plump pillows would be comfortable for reading.

The space was small but had everything she needed.

"Not bad for a new place."

Olivia Lopez remarked over the video call.

"Your DIY skills are still top-notch. You were always the renovation queen of our dorm."

Sophia smiled. "Of course I want to put effort into where I live."

"Sophia, you're stronger than I thought. Starting over again so quickly."

Olivia had guessed part of the reason when she heard the address, but didn't say it.

"I'm glad you can go back."

After ending the call, Sophia felt a little wistful.

She had realized things too late, but it wasn't too late to make up for it.

Six o'clock.

She had been busy all day and hadn't eaten.

There was bread, vegetables, and oatmeal in the fridge.

She simply made some porridge and a sandwich.

When returning the ladder, she packed some dinner to bring along.

Alexander was revising data for his paper.

He came to the door when he heard the knock.

"Thanks for the ladder. I made some dinner. Please try it, if you don't mind."

Under the light, the girl's eyes were clear and bright.

Alexander was momentarily stunned. He took the bag and thanked her.

He went back to his study to continue revising data.

By the time he finished, it was eight o'clock.

His stomach was empty and aching.

He habitually picked up his phone to order takeout.

He noticed the package under the desk lamp.

Opening it, he found it was still insulated. The porridge and sandwich were warm.

He took a bite of the sandwich and paused slightly.

The smoky bacon paired with fresh vegetables, and the fried egg was cooked perfectly.

He then tried the oatmeal porridge. It was smooth, warm, and much better than takeout.

Alexander's eyebrows raised slightly, his expression of approval.

Her cooking was indeed good...

He soon finished every bit of the dinner.

...

Ten o'clock.

Alexander, returning from his night run, ran into Sophia.

She wore casual clothes with her hair in a bun, standing out in the crowd.

"Out for a walk?"

"Just finished your run?"

They spoke simultaneously.

Sophia nodded. "Yeah, and picking up a package."

He adjusted his breathing and walked beside her.

"The dinner was delicious. Thank you."

"You've helped me twice. I should be thanking you."

The sounds of children playing came from a nearby park.

"It's quite lively here."

Ethan's mansion was always oppressively quiet.

Alexander followed her gaze.

He had lived here for over two months but rarely noticed these things.

Remembering a message he just received, he spoke calmly.

"I asked my junior. Professor Eleanor Watson is currently resting at home."

"I'm visiting her tomorrow at ten. Would you like to come along?"

"Ten tomorrow?"

That was fast...

The thought of meeting her professor after six years made her suddenly nervous.

"Is there a problem?"

"No."

Alexander noticed her change in mood but didn't ask further.

He disliked prying into privacy.

They said goodbye at their doors and went their separate ways.

Sophia showered absentmindedly and got into bed, trying to fall asleep.

It started drizzling around midnight.

She tossed and turned all night, sleeping poorly.

She got up early, had breakfast, and waited for Alexander.

Ten o'clock sharp.

A knock sounded right on time.

She opened the door immediately, already ready.

Alexander was slightly taken aback. "Shall we go?"
###Chapter 9

Sophia Sullivan walked ahead.

The man followed behind her.

She felt much more relaxed now compared to last night's nervousness.

Alexander Laurent drove the car over.

Sophia pulled open the car door and got in.

Halfway through the drive, they passed a fruit stand.

Sophia suddenly spoke up. "Could you pull over? I'd like to buy some fruit."

"Fruit?"

"Yes, for the professor."

Alexander gripped the steering wheel, slightly puzzled. "Is that necessary?"

Sophia was taken aback.

She couldn't help but laugh. "You usually show up empty-handed?"

Alexander nodded frankly.

Sophia silently gave a thumbs up. Impressive.

Maybe that was just how important people operated?

The man still pulled the car over to the side.

…

Professor Eleanor Watson lived on Ring Mountain Road near MIT.

Small Western-style houses were nestled among green trees.

Each had its own private yard, elegant and unique.

After passing through a maple grove, they saw the professor's house.

Six years…

Sophia tightened her grip on the seatbelt, looking at the fruit basket at her feet, suddenly feeling stage fright.

Alexander noticed her hesitation. "Not getting out?"

She bit her lip. "I want to wait a bit longer."

The man looked at her for two seconds, then nodded. "Then I'll go in first."

…

Sophia was grateful for his thoughtfulness.

Watching the man walk away, she took a deep breath and pushed the door open to get out.

The flowers in the small yard were in full bloom.

A gentle breeze carried a faint floral scent.

The vegetables by the railing looked a bit wilted, probably from lack of care.

Before even entering, she heard the professor's voice.

Sophia's heart tightened, and she quickened her pace to follow.

"Professor."

Eleanor Watson put down the magazine in her hand and adjusted her reading glasses. "Alexander? What brings you here?"

Alexander stepped forward to support her. "Just came to see you. Feeling better?"

"Just a minor ailment, and you all keep coming to check on me."

She patted his hand. "I'm fine, don't worry!"

Alexander paused. "I brought someone with me today."

"Who?" Eleanor asked, turning her head in confusion.

Sophia stood in the entryway, head bowed, like a child who had done something wrong.

Eleanor's pupils constricted slightly. She instinctively took two steps forward but quickly reined in her surprise, replacing it with coolness.

"What are you doing here?" she said sternly.

"Teacher…"

Sophia was at a loss.

Eleanor hardened her heart. "Who was it that said they were pursuing love? That they could disregard everything for love? What are you doing here now?"

Sophia pressed her lips together tightly, tears falling. "Teacher… I'm sorry. I let you down."

"And?" Eleanor was rarely this serious.

Sophia whispered, "And… I was wrong."

She added softly, "Is it still too late?"

"Finally…" Eleanor sighed, her expression softening. "Do you know how long I've waited?"

"Six years. A full six years."

Sophia's eyes welled up. "I didn't know…" Had the teacher been waiting for her all this time?

"It's good that you've figured it out."

A flicker of heartache passed through Eleanor's eyes.

Sophia's nose stung, and she threw herself into the older woman's arms. "Teacher…"

A dry palm patted her back gently. Eleanor's heart softened.

"Alright… Crying like this at your age, aren't you afraid people will laugh?"

Alexander stood quietly to the side. Seeing they had reconciled, he silently retreated to the balcony.

Reunited, Eleanor asked about Sophia's recent life, carefully avoiding topics of romance.

Hearing "I was wrong" today said everything.

Why would she need to pick at old scars?

Sophia said, "...I rented a place near the school. I'm reviewing my studies, preparing to take the exam for your graduate program…"

Eleanor's eyes lit up. "Really? Is that true?"

She asked twice.

"Yes." Sophia lowered her head, somewhat ashamed.

She hadn't taken the path that was laid out for her, and now she wanted to start over…

"Good! It's about time! You promised you'd be my graduate student! This year's spot wasn't reserved for nothing after all…"

Sophia was stunned.

Although she had suspected it, having it confirmed was still hard to believe.

Sophia Sullivan, what did you ever do to deserve this…

"Teacher, I might not pass the exam. You…" shouldn't get your hopes up.

Eleanor said, "If you want it, you will pass! I know your capabilities best. Unless you deliberately do poorly to tease me!"

"How could I…" Sophia didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

"It's getting late. You and Alexander… Huh? Where's Alexander?"

"Teacher." Alexander came in from the balcony.

"It's so late already. You and your junior sister must stay for dinner today. I'll cook myself!"

Sophia's expression changed. Alexander's face also looked subtle.

"Um… You should still rest. I'll cook."

It wasn't that Sophia was being disrespectful. It was just… The professor's cooking was truly dangerous.

Eleanor coughed awkwardly. She clearly knew her own culinary skills but still wanted to save face. "Ahem… Well, alright. I am recuperating. It's really not suitable for me to cook…"

Sophia tied on an apron and walked into the kitchen.

Alexander rolled up his sleeves and followed. "I'll help."

Eleanor watched the two of them, her smile deepening.

The refrigerator was well-stocked with fresh ingredients.

The professor had just been discharged from the hospital, so her diet needed to be light.

Alexander asked, "What do you need me to do?"

Sophia glanced at the vegetable basin. "Can you wash vegetables?"

"It shouldn't be too difficult."

Sophia moved aside.

The man washed the vegetables with clumsy but earnest movements, cleaning each leaf thoroughly.

Sophia asked casually, "Any dietary restrictions?"

"No."

"Preferences?"

"Anything is fine."

"...You're pretty easy to please," she muttered under her breath.

Not like that person, picky and hard to please.
###Chapter 10

Alexander Laurent remained silent.

Food was merely fuel to him.
Its taste was irrelevant.

"All washed."

Sophia Sullivan looked up.
The bell peppers and baby bok choy were arranged with obsessive precision.

"Something amusing?" Alexander glanced up.

Sophia cleared her throat lightly.
"Nothing. You can go ahead."

"Alright." He dried his hands and gave a slight nod.

Sophia prepared a table of light, bland dishes.
Most were tailored to Professor Eleanor Watson's dietary needs.

"You still remember my preferences..." the elderly woman sighed softly.

After the meal, Sophia began clearing the dishes.
Alexander naturally followed her into the kitchen.

He stood under the warm yellow light, his tall frame casting a long shadow.
His profile was sharp and defined, like a sculpture.

Professor Watson leaned against the doorway.
"Clara, how did you meet your senior colleague?"

Alexander was her most accomplished protégé.
Sophia was her favorite student.
She had long intended to introduce them.
Fate, it seemed, had brought them together first.

A voice suddenly called from outside—
"Professor Watson! You have a visitor!"

Professor Watson turned and went out.
A smiling young woman stood in the living room.

"Hello, Professor. I'm Amelia Roscente. I visited you at the hospital and inquired about the graduate program."

Professor Watson nodded.
"I remember. Please, have a seat."

Amelia's smile widened.
"I heard you were recuperating at home, so I brought some tonics..."

Professor Watson glanced at the gift boxes on the tea table.
Ginseng, bird's nest, cordyceps...
Her smile faded slightly.

Amelia continued, "About the graduate position I mentioned last time—"

Professor Watson interrupted her.
"Your kindness is appreciated, but please take these back. We admit students every year. The competition is fierce, and selection is based entirely on merit."

Amelia was stunned.
This wasn't what was discussed in the hospital...
The professor had said "there's a chance" and "you could try"...

"Professor, I—"

"Miss Roscente, I'm sorry, but I have other guests. I won't keep you. My assistant will help you carry these to your car."

The dismissal was clear.
Amelia walked out, crestfallen.

She bumped into someone on her way out.
"Sophia Sullivan?" she exclaimed. "What are you doing here?"

Sophia wore a simple white T-shirt and a printed apron.
She held a trash bag.

"What a coincidence." Sophia looked surprised, then smiled.
She didn't dislike Amelia.
Though she had a spoiled rich girl's air, it wasn't offensive.
Their acquaintance was superficial at best.

"You..." Amelia looked her over. "Working as a housekeeper now?"

Sophia: "?"

"Did my brother not give you any money?"

"??"

"Oh my god! How tacky! I can't stand this—" She stomped her heels in frustration and stormed off.

She pulled out her phone as she walked.
This wasn't about championing Sophia.
It was about her brother's appalling lack of class!
It was like skipping the tip at a fancy restaurant!
Amelia felt secondhand embarrassment.

"Hey—Ethan! I have to say, you're just—"

The call connected. Amelia prepared to unleash her tirade.

"Busy. Not in the mood for your nonsense."

"Who's nonsense? This is your fault! How can you be so stingy? Stingy men are as disgusting as rats!"

"Go bother someone else if you're having a meltdown." What was she even on about?

Amelia plowed on. "Sophia Sullivan cooked and cleaned for you. She kept you company. How can you not give her a single cent? Forcing her to work as a housekeeper? Don't you care about your reputation?"

Silence on the other end for a beat. "...Who did you say?"

"Sophia Sullivan."

"Housekeeper... What do you mean?"

Amelia described what she saw. "...This time you've really gone too far. Even a devoted follower deserves basic respect. Don't mistreat living things..."

Ethan Roscente didn't hear the rest.
His mind echoed with—
Sophia Sullivan. Housekeeper. Earning money...

So she had cashed the $7.2 million check but didn't dare use it.
He loosened his tie, his gaze dark and unreadable.
His expression was complex, almost philosophical.

Hah. She left so decisively. He thought she had really made it on her own.
Turns out...
Without him, she couldn't even survive.

"Ethan, you spacing out? Your turn."
Sebastian Evans pointed at the dice cup.

"Not playing anymore."
Ethan picked up his jacket and car keys, ready to leave.

"You were the one who wanted to hang out?"
Sebastian was confused.

Ethan: "Changed my mind. Something came up."

She should be begging him to pick her up by now, right?

...

Ethan waited and waited in his car.
Apart from work calls and messages, the call he wanted never came.

He stopped waiting.
He drove straight to Olivia Lopez's apartment.

Sophia had no family or close friends in the city.
Every time they fought, she ran to Olivia's.
He'd gone to fetch her countless times.
He knew the way by heart.

"Ethan Roscente?"
Someone called his name as he got out.

He turned to see Olivia arm-in-arm with a young man, heading home.

"What are you doing here?" Olivia's eyes were wary.

"Where's Sophia Sullivan?"

"What do you want?"

"I asked, where is Sophia Sullivan?" His patience was thin.

Olivia was bold and lived wildly.
Ethan's impression of her was poor.
He'd even warned Sophia to keep her distance, afraid she'd be influenced.
The usually obedient Sophia hadn't listened about this.
Ethan's opinion of Olivia sank further.

Olivia wasn't intimidated. "Get this straight, pal. You broke up. What right do you have to demand where she is?"

Ethan smirked coldly. "How many times have we 'broken up'? You can't even count them on one hand."

"So?"

"Blocking me now is pointless. Don't bother playing the villain."

Sophia would always come crawling back to apologize eventually.

Olivia laughed at his arrogance. "In your eyes, is Clara less than a dog? You can want her or discard her as you please? She's unimportant, not worth cherishing?"

Ethan didn't want to argue. "If you won't tell me, I'll go up and find her myself."

The young man next to Olivia stepped forward to block him. "Sir, breaking and entering is illegal."

Ethan didn't even look at him. He just gave Olivia a cold, knowing smile. "Fine. I'll remember this. But it won't matter. In the end, she'll still come begging back to me, obedient as a dog."
###Chapter 11

Ethan started the engine.

The sports car roared away, leaving a cloud of dust.

Olivia stamped her foot in fury.

"What an absolute jerk! Trash! Scumbag!"

She grabbed her boyfriend's collar.

"This time, Clara will never look back! Never!"

The young man nodded quickly. "Okay, okay, calm down…"

But was it possible?

That man's tone was so certain, so confident.

He stole a glance at Olivia.

If only she were that devoted to him…

Stop!

He didn't even dare to dream that dream.

…

Inside the car, Ethan's phone rang.

His voice was icy. "Speak."

"Darling, I found an amazing crab place. It's Saturday tomorrow, shall we try it?"

Isabella's voice was sweet and cheerful.

She knew Ethan loved seafood.

He hadn't contacted her since last night. She was panicking.

This unease made her call him first.

Usually, Ethan arranged their dates.

She just had to play hard to get before agreeing.

But things were different now.

He contacted her less and less.

His replies were brief, sometimes he didn't reply at all.

He always said he was busy.

Like now: "I'm busy Saturday."

"Sunday works too…" Isabella gripped her phone, her lips pale.

"I said I'm busy. That's all." Ethan hung up directly.

Isabella stared at the ended call, her panic returning.

No. She had worked so hard to become his official girlfriend. She couldn't lose…

…

The setting sun cast long shadows as Alexander and Sophia bid farewell to Professor Watson.

"Leaving so soon?" Professor Watson glanced at the darkening sky, her eyes full of reluctance. "Stay for dinner?"

Alexander shook his head. "I need to get back to the lab."

Sophia also declined softly. "Another time."

"Alright. Be careful on your way. Visit me often."

This last part was directed at Sophia.

She nodded hurriedly. "I will!"

"Oh, the materials and three books you left are on the table. Don't forget to take them."

She majored in Bioinformatics and had researched algorithms.

Her unfinished SCI paper from before graduation… Her professor had kept it…

Sophia's eyes grew warm. "Professor, I…"

"Enough now, off you go. The lunchbox is washed, don't forget it."

Sophia was taken aback.

Professor Watson chided gently, "You came all the way to my door but didn't come in. Just left a lunchbox. Made me eat too much."

Sophia's cheeks flushed. "It won't happen again…"

On the way back, Sophia knew Alexander was busy.

She felt bad asking him to drive her to her door, so she got out at the MIT entrance.

It wasn't far. She could walk.

Alexander nodded. "Alright."

…

Ethan's heart skipped a beat when he saw the figure by his mansion's gate.

But it sank just as quickly when he recognized who it was.

"Xixi."

"Ethan, you're back?" The girl stood up, delighted, her eyes shining like stars.

"What are you doing here?"

"Waiting for you. You said you were busy on the phone, so I waited until you finished work. I'm not disturbing you, am I?"

She was cautious, a little nervous.

"No." Ethan shook his head slowly.

"Good!" The smile returned to her face, but soon faded. "Ethan, I'm hungry…"

Isabella lowered her head, her cheeks puffed out.

"Let's go. I'll take you to dinner."

"Okay!"

They went to a Western restaurant. Ethan barely ate, but Isabella enjoyed her meal.

Sensing his bad mood, she spoke less.

"Full?"

Isabella nodded. "Mhm~"

"Let's go. I'll take you back to school."

"Okay."

The restaurant was very close to Caltech. They arrived in under ten minutes.

Isabella pushed the car door open, then paused. "Aren't you going to walk me in?"

Ethan nodded. "...Alright."

At the Caltech gate, the evening class had just ended. Many students were out looking for food.

Isabella was the acknowledged campus belle, drawing many glances.

Especially since she was holding the arm of a handsome, imposing man.

Isabella seemed not to hear the chatter. She turned and gave Ethan a radiant smile. "When will you meet my roommates? They're so curious about you."

No, the entire Caltech was curious about the campus belle's official boyfriend.

When that other woman was still around, she didn't dare be so conspicuous.

But it was different now. He had given her status. No need to hide anymore.

Ethan was silent.

He had no interest in meeting roommates.

Isabella seemed not to notice his冷淡. She continued smiling. "It's so wonderful. Every second with you is happy."

Suddenly, she turned to face Ethan. Before he could react, she stood on her toes and kissed him on the lips.

Whoa—

Exclamations erupted around them.

"The rumors are true! The campus belle really has a boyfriend!"

"Oh my god! It's just like a drama!"

"Isabella is so beautiful, and her boyfriend is so handsome."

"A perfect match! So sweet!"

Sophia stood at the back of the crowd.

She hadn't meant to watch, but the commotion drew her attention.

What… a coincidence.

Ethan came back to his senses. Looking at the smiling girl, another pair of bright eyes suddenly flashed in his mind.

At that MIT graduation ceremony years ago, that girl had also looked at him like this.

Her eyes sparkling, her smile like a flower: "Ethan Roscente, I choose you. I don't regret it."

Buried memories surged up unexpectedly, striking his soul.

He instinctively stepped back, putting distance between himself and Isabella.

"Ethan? What's…" The girl was confused.

Ethan: "It's late. You should go back now."
###Chapter 12

"Don't go," Isabella Langley shook her head.

She rose onto her toes and leaned in closer. "I want to spend more time with you."

Before she could get close, Ethan Roscente took control.

He wrapped one arm around her slender waist and kissed her.

A collective gasp rippled through the onlookers.

"Whoa—that's intense!"

"How deep must his love be?"

Sophia Sullivan watched it all unfold.

Her fingertips, clutching her book, turned white from the pressure.

Her heart still ached, but her expression was eerily calm.

Almost numb.

She thought she would get used to it eventually.

Quitting smoking came with withdrawal symptoms.

Let alone quitting a person she had loved for six years.

Sophia didn't linger.

She turned and left. She had studying to do.

In the crowd, Ethan seemed to sense something.

He turned his head.

A vaguely familiar figure slipped past the edge of his vision.

The next moment, a girl's soft hand slipped into his palm.

Their fingers intertwined intimately.

Isabella asked, "What are you looking at?"

Ethan withdrew his gaze. "...Nothing."

He walked her to her dorm and prepared to leave.

Isabella held his hand tightly, her eyes full of attachment.

"It's still early. Can't you stay a little longer?"

Ethan patted her head. "Be good. I'll pick you up this weekend."

Under the streetlight, he stood with his back to the light.

Shadows fell across his face, making his features appear more profound.

Isabella's eyes shimmered with a hint of pure seduction. "Ethan... could I come home with you tonight?"

Every adult understood the meaning behind those words.

Ethan paused briefly, complexity flashing in his eyes.

"You're still young. Let's wait a bit longer."

Isabella was momentarily stunned, then felt a secret thrill.

His refusal to take things further meant he cherished her.

It wasn't about momentary pleasure. He wanted a future with her.

"Alright, I have things to do. I should go."

Ethan checked his watch.

Isabella nodded obediently. "Okay. Remember to rest early. I'll bring you oatmeal porridge tomorrow."

He didn't respond.

His gaze seemed distant for a moment.

...

In her room.

The computer was on.

Sophia's typing slowed.

The image of them kissing flashed in her mind.

She pressed her lips together.

She went to the bathroom and splashed cold water on her face three times.

Her mind gradually cleared.

There was no point dwelling on a past she had already discarded.

Her priority was preparing for her exams. Time was running out.

Back at her computer, Sophia opened the two books Professor Eleanor Watson had given her.

One was a textbook on bioinformatics.

The other was a notebook filled with annotations.

There was also a USB drive.

It contained the paper she had abandoned during her undergraduate studies.

It was originally preparation for grad school, but then...

For that paper, she had spent three days and nights in the lab, forgetting to eat and sleep.

She had spent nearly half a year just collecting and organizing data.

The arguments and solutions were meticulously refined.

Even after giving up the combined Master's and Ph.D. program to care for Ethan at home, Sophia hadn't completely abandoned this paper.

Over the years, she had only done two things.

First, being Ethan's unpaid homemaker.

Second, perfecting this paper.

Professor Watson had the portion completed during her undergrad.

Sophia retrieved the latter half from her computer.

Combining them formed a complete thesis.

In that moment, it felt like her muddled past and her suddenly clear future had met.

They came together to form a complete version of herself.

She worked until dawn.

Looking at the finished draft, Sophia decided to strike while the iron was hot.

She submitted it to "Science"—

One of the world's top three academic journals.

It represented the highest level of human natural science research.

Sophia wasn't confident about getting accepted, but she wanted to try.

Before full daylight, she shut down her computer and caught some sleep.

At eight, she woke up on time.

She washed up, ate breakfast, gathered her review materials, and headed to the library.

She didn't expect to run into Alexander Laurent just returning as she left.

It was raining outside.

The closed umbrella in his hand was still dripping.

"Morning. You... didn't pull an all-nighter, did you?"

Alexander replied, "Yeah. Rushing for experimental data."

He had just returned from the lab to grab something quickly before heading back.

"Here, for you." Sophia handed him a warm milk carton. "This will warm you up."

"...Thank you."

"You got rained on. Remember to change your clothes."

She pointed at his shoulder.

Alexander tilted his head and noticed it was damp.

"I should get going then." Sophia smiled and turned to go downstairs.

Before nine, the library was already quite busy.

She closed her umbrella.

Before entering, a familiar voice called out.

"Sophia Sullivan—"

Amelia Roscente had come to campus today to discuss postgraduate matters with university administrators.

It started raining as she passed the library, trapping her there temporarily.

She didn't expect to bump into an acquaintance.

"What are you doing at the library? Another part-time job? Short on cash lately? Don't worry, I already mentioned it to my brother. Told him to be more generous."

"You should quit these jobs soon. Taking care of my brother is what's most important. I heard his stomach acted up again yesterday. You..."

"Amelia, who are you talking to?" A voice interrupted before she could finish.

A tall, elegant middle-aged woman approached.

Up close, she wore the latest C spring haute couture.

Her well-maintained face showed no wrinkles.

She carried a rare leather Hermès Kelly.

Victoria Roscente walked to her daughter's side and glanced over.

Wasn't this her son's low-cost little girlfriend?

She looked Sophia up and down.

Her already unfavorable expression grew more disdainful.

A T-shirt and jeans for going out.

No makeup.

Hair unstyled.

Really not presentable at all.

Victoria glanced at the library behind them.

Then her eyes swept over the two books in Sophia's hands.

Her gaze deepened.

"Miss Sullivan, what a coincidence."

She emphasized the word "coincidence" deliberately.

The implication was clear: even staging such a clumsy accidental meeting to curry favor.

"You've certainly put in the effort," Victoria sighed. "But as the old saying goes, a monkey in clothes is still a monkey, no matter how well it dresses. Save these tricks for later. I'm not buying it."

"Since we've met today, I might as well be blunt. Our Ethan could never marry you. But considering you've taken care of his daily needs all these years, if there's no credit, there's at least hard work. After he gets married, we'll keep a position open for you by his side."

"As for anything else, don't entertain any false hopes. Know your place, and you can last long. Understand?"
###Chapter 13

Among wealthy families, arranged marriages often mean both parties lead separate lives.

A man keeping mistresses on the side is hardly a concern.

As long as the wife's position is secure, the outside dalliances are merely diversions.

Victoria Roscente considered herself an enlightened mother-in-law.

She never excessively interfered in her son's private life.

Speaking to Sophia Sullivan today was already a tremendous concession on her part.

But the expected scene of tearful gratitude never materialized.

Sophia merely glanced at her coldly, a faint, mocking smile curling her lips.

"Mrs. Roscente, save your charity for those who actually need it."

"Ethan and I have already broken up."

"From now on, let's just be strangers."

In the past, for Ethan's sake, she had endured Victoria's endless nitpicking.

Her degrees were never good enough, she lacked an overseas education, she had no career achievements.

In short, she was never worthy of the Roscente family heir.

But now, she didn't even want Ethan anymore.

What right did this would-be mother-in-law have to judge her?

Sophia leaned forward slightly, her red lips parting.

"Let me offer you some advice."

"Try not to be so cutting with your words in the future."

"It might get you slapped."

"And one more thing—"

"A monkey in fine clothes is still just a monkey."

"You should learn some manners."

She turned and walked into the library, her skirt swaying gracefully.

Victoria stood frozen on the spot, her face livid with rage.

"How dare she speak to me like that?!"

"Who does she think she is?! Does she still want to marry into our family?!"

Amelia Roscente winced from her mother's tight grip, finally snapping back to reality.

"Mom... did she say she broke up with Ethan?"

"Don't tell me you believe that nonsense?"

"Everyone knows Sophia is obsessed with Ethan."

"She used to cling to him like a desperate dog, refusing to let go."

Amelia checked the time.

"Let's go meet the university administrators. We're going to be late."

Victoria took a deep breath, forcing her anger down.

"Let's go. Don't let that trash delay important matters."

...

The MIT library held vast collections and was revered as an academic sanctuary.

Sophia circled twice before finding an empty seat.

The bioinformatics section was right behind her.

Her gaze swept across the top shelf, where she unexpectedly spotted Alexander Laurent's work.

Curious, she pulled it out. The cover featured a deep, cosmic star chart.

It perfectly captured his essence—vast, serene, and profoundly enigmatic.

It was a research notebook on protein molecular structures.

A cross-disciplinary study blending biology and physics.

The title page bore a handwritten inscription: 'All things are connected. Knowledge has no borders.'

Only a genius like him could state interdisciplinary study so matter-of-factly.

Sophia became engrossed, unaware of how much time had passed.

Though her undergraduate major was bioinformatics, her physics grades were equally outstanding.

By 1 PM, she closed the book and returned it to its place.

Her stomach ached with hunger.

Just as she stepped out of the library, her phone rang. It was Olivia Lopez.

"Vivi?"

"Are you home?"

"I'm at the library. What's up?"

"That scumbag Ethan came looking for you yesterday!"

"He demanded to know where you were. Like I'd ever tell him?"

"You haven't run into him lately, have you?"

Sophia took a sip of water.

"No."

"Good." Olivia sighed in relief. "Are you free tonight? I need a favor..."

...

After meeting the university administrators, Amelia's mood improved.

The frustration Professor Eleanor Watson caused had completely vanished.

"Mom, let's get in the car."

Victoria stared intently toward the library, her brow furrowed.

"You go ahead. There's something I need to take care of."

She called for another family driver.

Amelia assumed her mother was heading to a tea party and didn't think much of it.

Unbeknownst to her, Victoria got in the car and instructed directly,

"Take me to Ethan's office."

...

Ethan had just finished a meeting when he saw his mother approaching with a stormy expression.

He felt a headache coming on. "Mom, what are you doing here?"

"Can't I visit my son?"

"That's not what I meant." He rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly.

Victoria snorted coldly and settled onto the sofa.

"If you can't control your woman, I can step in and handle it for you."

Ethan was baffled. "What?"

"Look at Sophia's attitude! It's all because you spoiled her!"

"I ran into her at the MIT library earlier. She actually talked back after I said just a few words!"

"She called me cutting and mocked me for being uneducated!"

"Trash from a low-class family has no manners!"

Ethan frowned. "You saw her at the library?"

"Instead of staying home to cook and clean, she prances around the library pretending to be intellectual!"

"Does she think that will make me respect her? Dream on!"

"She even claimed she's broken up with you and that you're strangers now!"

"Since when does a junior speak to an elder like that?!"

Victoria suddenly fixed her gaze on him. "Did you two really break up?"

Ethan found himself saying, "Of course not."

"Hmph! I knew it! She'd never let go of her golden ticket!"

"Go home and teach her a proper lesson! Women need discipline to behave!"

Ethan was growing irritated.

"Mom, I have another meeting soon. Let me have someone drive you home."

Seeing his son's darkening expression, Victoria wisely dropped the subject.

"Just remember to discipline her. Women only listen when they're taught a lesson!"

"Mm."

After seeing his mother out, Ethan loosened his tie and let out a long breath.

The setting sun cast long shadows through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

He didn't want to return to the Beverly Hills mansion.

Remembering Isabella Langley's birthday was in two days, he texted Charlie Lowell for gift ideas.

Charlie replied instantly: [Jewelry is always safe. A necklace or bracelet.]

Ethan: [I'm bad at picking. Come with me.]

Charlie: ? Since when does being single make me an expert?!

They met at the SKP mall downtown.

Inside the jewelry store, a sales associate greeted them warmly.

"What can I help you gentlemen find today?"

Ethan: "A gift for my girlfriend."

"This heart pendant necklace is very popular with young women. It's understated yet sweet—"

Charlie, bored with jewelry, glanced around.

Suddenly, he exclaimed excitedly, "Sophia?!"

Ethan stiffened, then turned casually as if nothing was wrong.

Olivia had a business banquet tonight and had asked Sophia to pick up her custom jewelry.

She never expected to run into them here.

Sophia smiled at Charlie. "Charlie."

"Long time no see! Been busy lately?" He sneakily glanced at Ethan. "Since we ran into you, want to grab dinner together?"
###Chapter 14

Sophia Sullivan declined Charlie Lowell's dinner invitation.

She held up the jewelry box in her hand.

Charlie recognized the custom packaging of a haute couture brand.

He tactfully did not press further.

Sophia turned to leave.

She walked past Ethan Roscente without a glance.

As if he were air.

Charlie coughed awkwardly.

Ethan's face darkened, his expression stormy.

A clerk cautiously approached to assist.

Ethan coldly demanded the most expensive piece.

He refused to believe no one would appreciate it.

…

Lights blazed in the Beverly Hills mansion.

Sophia arrived alone at the party.

Many recognized her.

Whispers spread through the crowd.

Their gazes held pity and mockery.

Olivia Lopez hurried over to greet her.

Sophia handed her the jewelry box.

They exchanged a few brief words.

Sophia declined the invitation to stay for dinner.

She turned to leave, her back straight and proud.

The gossip grew bolder.

"Daring to show up dressed like that?"

"Six years and she got nothing out of it?"

"My housekeeper is better off…"

Her assistant looked at her with concern.

Sophia's expression remained calm and unreadable.

She had expected this.

The setting sun cast her long shadow.

"Sophia Sullivan?"

A familiar voice called from behind.

Daniel Anderson approached, holding a glass of wine.

A tipsy smile touched his eyes.

He brought up the graduation ceremony six years ago.

Sophia felt slightly awkward.

The memory of two men pursuing her was still vivid.

She tried to excuse herself.

Daniel blocked her path.

He stated bluntly that Ethan treated her like property.

Sophia's smile faded.

She asked what he really meant.

Daniel looked directly into her eyes.

He said Ethan was just competitive.

The words cut like a knife.

Sophia's face instantly paled.

Daniel reached to touch her cheek.

She stepped back, avoiding his hand.

Her tone was distant as she told him to show respect.

Daniel pressed closer.

He knew they had broken up.

He confessed his feelings again.

He promised to be better than Ethan.

Sophia suddenly laughed.

She said she wouldn't jump back into the fire after just escaping.

Her skirt swirled decisively as she turned away.

Daniel watched her retreating figure and murmured.

He said the tree may prefer calm, but the wind will not subside.

…

Julian Winston put away his phone.

The photo was perfectly timed.

Sebastian Evans raised an eyebrow at him.

They exchanged a knowing look.

The memory of that past rivalry was still fresh.

Julian sent the photo to Ethan.

Sebastian warned him not to go too far.

Julian smiled dismissively.

He said she was just an ex-girlfriend.

Sebastian's gaze skimmed over the elegant profile in the photo.

He softly agreed.

The wind lifted Sophia's long hair.

She tucked a stray strand behind her ear.

Night gradually enveloped the city.

Neon lights flickered on one by one.

Illuminating the path she walked alone.
###Chapter 15

Assistant Moore dropped Sophia Sullivan off at the entrance of her residential complex.

She thanked him softly and stepped out of the car.

Instead of going straight home, she turned towards the nearby grocery store.

Twenty minutes later, she walked towards her building, carrying two full bags of ingredients.

The setting sun cast long shadows.

A tall figure approached, bathed in the evening glow.

Alexander Laurent wore a light grey trench coat, his steps measured.

His gaze behind the gold-rimmed glasses was focused and clear.

"Professor Laurent," Sophia spoke first.

He looked up at the sound of her voice and gave a slight nod. "What a coincidence."

"I just bought some groceries. Would you like to join me for dinner?"

Alexander initially intended to decline, but then he remembered her clear broth noodles.

The memory on his tongue made him nod.

This was Alexander Laurent's first time entering her rented apartment.

Tulips bloomed vibrantly on the balcony. Two red carp swam leisurely in the fish tank.

The white sheer curtains fluttered gently in the evening breeze. The cherrywood dining table gleamed with a warm luster.

The entire space was tidy and cozy.

Graduate entrance exam practice problems were spread across the glass coffee table. He glanced at them.

The multiple-choice questions were almost all correct.

"Would you like something to drink?" Sophia asked.

"Warm water is fine."

She handed him a glass. The water temperature was perfect.

"Thank you."

"Let's have hot pot tonight. I bought fresh beef."

She took vegetables and handmade meatballs out of the bags.

"This question is wrong." Alexander suddenly pointed to the test paper.

Sophia followed his gaze. "This question involves biophysics. I don't quite understand the dynamics part yet."

"The choice of potential directly affects the molecular trajectory," he stated concisely.

Sophia paused, then her eyes lit up. "I see!"

Alexander was slightly surprised. "You understood that?"

"Most of it," she answered honestly. "I saw your research notes in the library."

"Those are old notes from my undergraduate days," he said, clearing his throat lightly. "They contain many errors and omissions."

Sophia couldn't help but smile.

Quite a few, indeed.

"You're very bright. The entrance exam shouldn't be difficult for you."

Her eyes curved into a smile. "Thank you for the kind words, Professor."

...
The lights were just coming on outside the SKP mall.

Ethan Roscente walked ahead, carrying a jewelry bag. Charlie Lowell followed behind.

He carried jewelry worth nearly seven figures casually in his hand, the paper bag swinging.

Charlie watched with trepidation.

The store clearly offered secure delivery, but Ethan insisted on carrying it himself.

Unfortunately, they hadn't run into the person he hoped to see.

"Shall we get dinner first?" Charlie suggested.

Ethan gave a noncommittal grunt.

Charlie chose a well-known Cantonese restaurant.

The private room on the second floor had an open view and an elegant atmosphere.

The server presented the menu. There was a wide variety of Cantonese dishes, especially soups.

Charlie was overwhelmed by the choices.

"I heard this place is very authentic. Anything you feel like having, Ethan?"

"Whatever." Ethan fiddled with his lighter, distracted.

The image of Sophia Sullivan brushing past him indifferently kept replaying in his mind.

She dared to pretend not to know him.

Since she moved out of Olivia's place, why hadn't she come back?

How long was she going to keep this up?

He lit a cigarette and took a deep drag.

Charlie ordered purple basil duck, sweet and sour pork, and a seafood dish.

The dishes arrived one after another, filling the air with aroma.

Charlie, starving, dug in enthusiastically.

He looked up to see Ethan picking at his food listlessly, pushing grains of rice around.

"Sophia might still be angry. She'll come around in a while."

Charlie hesitated. "You did break up with her on the spot that day. It was humiliating. Just give her some time to cool off, then smooth things over."

Ethan's face was cold. "Who's thinking about her? Mind your own business."

"...Okay." Charlie inwardly rolled his eyes.

Ethan's phone vibrated suddenly.

He opened the message. A photo popped up.

In the blurry pixels, a woman stood sideways. A man was reaching out as if to touch her face.

He instantly recognized Sophia Sullivan and Daniel Anderson.

Ethan's eyes turned icy.

Charlie's heart sank. "What's wrong?"

The phone was slammed onto the table.

"This is what you call 'coming around'? Her audacity knows no bounds!"

She dared to see Daniel Anderson again.

Charlie glimpsed the photo and immediately felt a headache coming on.

Daniel certainly knew how to seize an opportunity.

"Her taste has certainly deteriorated since leaving me," Ethan sneered. "To think she'd settle for that."

Did she think he cared?

...
Sophia was completely unaware of all this.

Her life was filled with studying, simple and fulfilling.

She traveled daily between her apartment and the library. In her spare time, she cooked for herself, occasionally sharing with neighbors working late.

Though her material life wasn't as lavish as before, the air she breathed was free.

"Sophia, are you studying?" Olivia Lopez called right on time.

"Yes." She moved to a corner and lowered her voice.

"It's Friday. Come out for dinner?"

"But..."

"No buts. Even a workhorse needs a break. You need balance."

"Alright."

They agreed to meet at a Japanese restaurant.
###Chapter 16

Olivia Lopez had a weakness for sashimi.

She ordered a platter of fresh salmon and sweet shrimp without hesitation.

Sophia Sullivan never touched raw or cold food.

She only asked for a bowl of tonkotsu ramen and some eel sushi.

The noodles were average.

But the broth was rich, and the ingredients were fresh.

Watching Sophia eat so properly, Olivia couldn't resist teasing her. "The belly cut is so fatty. It melts in your mouth. Sure you won't try it?"

Sophia shook her head firmly. "You know me. Raw food is never an option."

"After all these years, you really haven't changed a bit."

Olivia had long noticed how stubborn Sophia was about her likes and dislikes.

"I've been so busy lately, I haven't even had time for a manicure. My hands are rough."

She sighed, her tone resigned. "My dad keeps pushing me to go on blind dates. And my mom doesn't stop him; she just joins in the plotting."

"It's not like they can't afford to keep me. Why the rush?"

"Even my workaholic cousin isn't married. Why should I be in a hurry…"

Mentioning Alexander Laurent made Sophia's mind wander.

They were neighbors, but both were busy with their own lives.

Aside from him bringing her a sandwich that one time, she hadn't seen him in days.

Olivia didn't notice her distraction. She took a bite of sushi and remembered something. "How did it go with my brother and Professor Watson?"

Sophia swallowed her soup before answering. "The professor saved a spot for me. I just have to pass the entrance exam this year."

Olivia clapped. "Brilliant! I love seeing you so motivated!"

"As a reward, I'm taking you somewhere this weekend."

Sophia looked up. "Where?"

"It's a secret."

...

After the meal, Sophia insisted on returning to the library.

Olivia drove her back.

She finished two more practice tests. When she looked up, it was already dusk.

The setting sun streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, bathing her in a warm, golden light.

Sophia stretched her arms and began packing her books.

The closing announcement played right on time.

She picked up her bag and left.

The sunset painted the sky in layers of red, like a spilled palette.

Sophia walked slowly, pondering what to have for dinner.

Without realizing it, she arrived at her building.

A dark figure suddenly entered her line of sight.

Lab data had errors. Alexander Laurent had been working nonstop for days. The results were still unsatisfactory.

The co-lead was a middle-aged man who had been on the project since its inception.

He looked worried. "The initial data was positive. The process was smooth. How could there be an error?"

Alexander frowned slightly. "Experimentation is about trial and error. The result isn't the only metric."

"But erroneous data means a wrong direction. We've repeated it dozens of times. Isn't a week enough to see that?"

The man ventured cautiously, "Since we can't proceed, maybe we should cut our losses? A different direction might be better?"

Alexander's gaze sharpened. "Are you afraid of failure, or do you prefer the profit-driven approach Professor Zhu proposed?"

He adjusted his glasses. "Physics has its own rhythm. It doesn't stop just because you say so."

The man looked embarrassed. "I was just making a suggestion…"

The conversation ended awkwardly.

Alexander turned and saw Sophia smiling and waving. "Long time no see, neighbor."

They walked back side by side.

Sophia avoided sensitive topics, making casual conversation.

"Thanks for last time. My practice has been going much smoother lately."

Alexander didn't take credit. "You have good intuition. Have you contacted the professor recently?"

Sophia looked down, stepping on loose pebbles. "We've spoken on the phone a few times. She's recovering well and should be back at school soon."

Alexander nodded. "Good. She's never been one to sit still."

The sky grew darker.

A bicycle wobbled toward them.

Sophia happened to step on a loose tile. She lost her balance and was about to collide.

Alexander quickly grabbed her wrist. With a gentle pull, he moved her to his side, away from danger.

"Are you okay?"

His fingertips were warm, firmly holding her wrist through her thin sleeve.

The heat traveled up her arm, making Sophia's ears burn.

"I'm fine. Thank you."

They were too close. Their breaths almost mingled.

Sophia took half a step back.

Alexander let go of her wrist.

The rest of the walk was silent.

They said goodbye at their doors.

Behind her closed door, the scene replayed in her mind.

The warmth of his fingers, his faint minty scent, his deep, unreadable eyes…

Sophia looked down and rubbed her wrist.

The skin there still felt warm.

...

Returning from the lab and the argument left Alexander feeling uncomfortable.

He changed into slippers and prepared to shower.

He picked up his phone to order takeout.

A shopping app notification suddenly popped up—a pair of bear slippers, priced at $9.99.

He paused.

That's what Sophia was wearing the last time he visited.

Her toes were small and round. The dark slippers made her skin look snow-white.

He suddenly remembered that moment earlier.

Her wrist was so small he could circle it with one hand.

And the skin there seemed even whiter.

...

Sunday brought blazing sunshine.

Isabella Langley chose a light green floral dress with a ruffled hem. It was fresh and artistic.

She spent an hour on a full face of makeup, perfect and precise.

Her upper bunkmate teased her. "No sleeping in on the weekend? Up so early? And all dressed up. Someone's lucky to have a date with you."

Ever since photos of Isabella kissing Ethan Roscente at the school gate spread, the whole campus knew she was taken.

Another girl chimed in. "It must be Mr. Roscente! Isabella, it's your birthday today. He must have a surprise planned, right?"

Isabella put on her sunflower earrings. Her heart was full of anticipation, but her words were modest. "I'm not sure. Maybe?"

Her roommate wanted to ask more.

She checked the time and hurriedly grabbed her bag and changed shoes. "I'll tell you later. I have to go!"
###Chapter 17

Isabella Langley hurried down the stairs.

The familiar black sports car was parked outside the school gate.

Ethan Roscente leaned against the car door.

He wore a beige sweatshirt under a dark gray trench coat.

Black athletic pants accentuated his long legs.

He exuded a youthful, refreshing aura.

Passing girls couldn't help but glance his way.

He checked his watch for the third time.

His brow furrowed slightly.

They had agreed to meet at ten.

It was already five minutes past.

He pulled out his phone to call.

Suddenly, someone hugged him from behind.

A girl's sweet, fresh scent washed over him.

Isabella Langley stood on her toes, wrapping her arms around his neck.

Her voice was soft and sugary. "Have you been waiting long?"

"You're late."

Ethan Roscente gave her a brief glance.

His hands remained in his pockets.

"I'll be on time next time, I promise!"

Isabella Langley secretly studied his expression.

She relaxed only when she saw he wasn't angry.

"Get in the car."

Ethan Roscente opened the passenger door.

Isabella Langley happily slid into the seat.

She chattered nonstop during the drive.

Ethan Roscente focused on the road.

He offered occasional, brief replies.

At a red light, she looked out the window.

A giant LED screen displayed an ad for Universal Studios Hollywood.

Her eyes lit up.

She gently tugged his sleeve.

"Can we go to Universal Studios?"

"Whatever you want."

Ethan Roscente turned the steering wheel.

He casually handed her a luxury shopping bag.

"Your birthday gift."

Isabella Langley opened the box and gasped.

"The limited edition C bracelet!"

She eagerly slipped it onto her wrist.

The shell design was encrusted with tiny diamonds.

It sparkled brilliantly in the sunlight.

She waved her wrist in front of him.

"Isn't it beautiful? How did you know I wanted this..."

Her voice dripped with honey.

The light turned green.

Ethan Roscente pressed the accelerator.

He glanced over and saw her taking pictures.

He spoke flatly.

"As long as you like it."

...

Sophia Sullivan was jolted awake by her ringing phone.

Olivia Lopez's voice pierced through the receiver.

"Hurry downstairs! I can't park long! Ten minutes!"

Ten minutes later, Sophia Sullivan got into the sports car.

She handed over a sandwich.

Olivia Lopez took a bite and laughed.

"You really are never late."

The sports car sped along.

It finally stopped at the entrance to Universal Studios Hollywood.

Sophia Sullivan looked up at the iconic globe.

"...We're here?"

"Studying every day is so boring!"

Olivia Lopez jumped out of the car.

"We have to relax today!"

She quickly returned with tickets.

She held two plush headbands.

She shoved a white fox one at Sophia Sullivan.

She put on a pink doll herself.

Seeing Sophia Sullivan hesitate, she urged, "Put it on!"

Sophia Sullivan reluctantly complied.

Olivia Lopez studied her carefully.

"You look like a little fox spirit descended from heaven!"

She grabbed Sophia Sullivan's hand and charged forward.

"Follow me! I've got the whole plan mapped out!"

Screams echoed from the roller coaster.

Five minutes later, Olivia Lopez was pale.

She leaned over a trash can, dry heaving.

Sophia Sullivan gently patted her back.

"Feeling any better?"

"Guh—"

Olivia Lopez retched again.

Sophia Sullivan offered water and tissues.

She only relaxed after Olivia Lopez rinsed her mouth.

"That was pure hell..."

Olivia Lopez complained while wiping her mouth.

Sophia Sullivan was amused. "Who told you to insist on riding it?"

She was afraid of heights yet still challenged herself.

She had no one to blame but herself.

"My mistake..."

Olivia Lopez leaned against her to rest.

She perked up again soon after.

It was lunchtime.

Sophia Sullivan suggested they eat first.

As they passed the plaza, the crowd grew excited.

Tourists raised their phones to take pictures.

"Look at the balloons!"

"So many balloons!"

Sophia Sullivan looked up.

The blue sky was filled with colorful balloons.

Ribbons fluttered in the wind.

Like dancing butterflies.

Someone browsing their phone gasped.

"It's a birthday surprise from a rich heir for his girlfriend!"

"So romantic..."

Olivia Lopez was uninterested.

She pulled Sophia Sullivan away.

"I'm starving. Let's eat."

"Okay."

...

A long line stretched before the pirate ship.

Ethan Roscente stood in the middle of the queue.

Isabella Langley brought him a slushie.

"We're almost there! Just a little longer!"

The temperature was rising.

Ethan Roscente took off his coat and draped it over his arm.

He looked down at his phone.

Sudden exclamations rose around them.

Isabella Langley followed the gazes.

A sea of balloons rose near the carousel.

A man holding roses walked toward his girlfriend.

They embraced.

It was romantic, like a fairy tale.

"Such a romantic birthday surprise..."

Isabella Langley murmured softly.

Today was her birthday too.

She wondered if Ethan Roscente had a surprise planned...

Ethan Roscente lazily glanced over.

His expression remained blank as he returned to his phone.

He found such displays utterly boring.

He'd never done these things for Sophia Sullivan.

He wasn't about to start now.
###Chapter 18

Olivia Lopez bought two tickets for the dolphin show.

She pulled Sophia Sullivan toward the performance hall.

Cool air from the air conditioning greeted them inside.

Sophia had little interest in animal performances.

But Olivia was exceptionally excited.

She shoved her camera into Sophia's hands.

She needed to document the interaction segment.

Olivia smiled sweetly when the dolphin leaped from the water.

Sophia found herself smiling too.

After the show, she handed her bag to Olivia.

She turned and headed for the restroom.

Rounding the corner, she saw Isabella Langley at the sinks.

Sophia didn't pause.

She walked straight into a stall.

When she came out, Isabella was still there.

Clearly waiting for her.

Sophia turned on the faucet.

The sound of running water broke the silence.

The atmosphere was tense and subtle.

She looked up and met Isabella's gaze.

Sophia coolly looked away.

Isabella suddenly laughed.

She raised her wrist, showing off a bracelet.

"What a coincidence, Sophia."

Sophia didn't respond.

Isabella kept talking.

"How have you been lately?"

Sophia's lips curved into a slight smile.

"Not bad."

Isabella studied her.

Searching for any crack in her composure.

After a few seconds, she gave a light laugh.

"It must be tough, living outside the mansion now."

Sophia turned off the water.

"None of your concern."

Tears welled in Isabella's eyes.

"Thank you for being willing to step aside."

"It lets me have Ethan completely."

Sophia continued washing her hands.

She worked the soap into a lather between her fingers.

Focused and meticulous.

Isabella twisted her wrist.

"You saw the balloon display, right?"

"Ethan's birthday surprise for me."

"And this bracelet."

"He said it suits my pale skin."

Sophia glimpsed the bracelet's logo.

Understanding dawned instantly.

So the jewelry store visit was to pick a gift for her.

Her nails dug into her palms.

The pain brought her back to herself.

She forced a smile.

"Congratulations."

Then she turned and walked away.

Olivia was waiting at the exit.

She waved Sophia over.

"You look pale. Are you okay?"

Sophia rubbed her temples.

"Vivi, I want to go home."

"But it's barely past three."

Olivia grabbed her arm.

"I got us tickets for the Haunted Town."

"They say it's super popular."

Sophia raised an eyebrow.

"I thought you were scared of ghosts."

Olivia grinned.

"Not when I'm with you."

They ended up going.

Their tickets were checked at the haunted house entrance.

A curtain was pulled aside, releasing a chill draft.

Screams echoed from a pitch-black corridor.

Olivia gripped Sophia's hand tightly.

She inched forward reluctantly.

Sophia practically dragged her along.

"We can skip this."

Olivia shook her head.

"We're already here."

A terrifying mannequin suddenly jumped out.

Olivia shrieked and dodged.

"Sophia, save me!"

Ethan Roscente turned his head sharply.

He thought he heard a familiar name.

He looked around but saw no one.

He frowned.

Isabella clung to his arm.

"Ethan, I'm scared."

"You have to protect me."

Ethan answered absently.

A red light flashed in the darkness.

Isabella gripped his arm tightly.

She hid at his side, too afraid to move.

A female ghost NPC appeared suddenly.

Isabella buried her face in his chest.

She trembled violently.

"Is it gone, Ethan?"

Ethan patted her back gently.

"It's okay now."

The cheap makeup was laughable.

But it made him think of Sophia.

She was never this timid.

Her name surfaced in his mind, startling him.

Why did he keep thinking of her unintentionally?

He had clearly wanted to end things.

Isabella looked up.

She noticed the depth in his eyes.

"Ethan, what's wrong?"

Ethan reined in his emotions.

"Let's keep going."

Olivia mustered her courage and entered.

A small zombie in a coffin opened its eyes.

She screamed and bolted.

She vanished in an instant.

Sophia stood there, stunned.

She really ran fast.

The exit was closed.

Sophia had to find another way out.

Wandering around, she locked eyes with an NPC.

The NPC in the coffin blinked.

Its long tongue prop fell out.

Sophia was silent for two seconds.

She stepped forward and pushed it back in.

The NPC's eyes held gratitude.

The town had three exit paths.

Sophia got lost.

Ten minutes later, she was still going in circles.

It was more like a maze.

The three paths looked almost identical.

One was a dead end.

An alarm suddenly blared overhead.

Sophia was speechless.

So effective.

A fire alarm announcement sounded.

The crowd panicked, surging toward the exit.

Sophia
###Chapter 19

The alarm stopped.

The lights came back on.

The area was empty except for her.

The map on the wall glowed faintly.

She followed the direction of the arrows.

Noisy voices came from the distance.

The exit seemed to be blocked.

Sophia Sullivan hesitated and stopped.

A crowd suddenly surged from behind.

She was pushed toward the wall by the crowd.

Someone stepped on her foot.

She crashed into the uneven wall.

Her chest ached from the impact.

She couldn't help but gasp.

She suddenly felt someone's gaze.

She looked up.

Her eyes met Ethan Roscente's.

He looked at her disheveled state, his expression complex.

So it was really her.

That call of "Clara" wasn't an illusion.

But she actually had the leisure to play in a haunted house.

She seemed quite happy after the breakup.

Isabella Langley nervously grabbed Ethan's arm.

Her gaze toward Sophia was defensive.

Sophia lowered her eyes, not wanting to engage.

She turned to push through the crowd and leave.

The lights flickered on and off.

Someone suddenly screamed.

A suspended wooden sword swayed precariously.

It was aimed directly at Sophia's head.

"Watch out!"

Ethan didn't think. He shook off Isabella.

He pushed through the crowd and rushed over.

He pulled Sophia into a safe corner.

With a loud clang.

The wooden sword hit the ground.

It was actually iron, painted to look like wood.

If that had hit someone...

Sophia gasped in delayed fear.

She then noticed Ethan was still holding her hand.

She immediately pulled away.

She leaned against the wall and stood up.

"Thank you."

Ethan's eyes darkened at her distant expression.

"Nothing else to say besides thank you?"

Sophia looked at him, puzzled.

What else was there to say between them?

"Why did you block me?"

Ethan stepped closer, his voice low.

Sophia was a little surprised.

During past arguments, she was always the first to unblock him.

But this time...

She curved her lips slightly.

"It's normal to delete an ex after a breakup."

Ethan frowned.

"When will you add me back?"

Sophia's eyelashes fluttered.

"I won't."

Ethan looked at her irritably.

"How long are you going to stay angry?"

Sophia smiled sarcastically.

The crowd surged again, separating them.

He tried to grab Sophia's hand.

But Isabella wrapped her arm around his.

Isabella watched the scene with jealousy.

She squeezed next to Ethan and held him tightly.

"Baby, let's get out of here. It's so dark."

"I almost fell earlier. I was so scared."

"Don't leave me, okay..."

Her voice trembled, sounding pitiful.

Staff maintained order at the entrance.

"The malfunction has been resolved. Please evacuate in an orderly manner."

The chaos quickly subsided.

Sophia walked out without looking back.

Ethan pulled his arm free and followed.

Isabella gritted her teeth and chased after him.

"Ethan, wait for me—"

Olivia Lopez was already waiting at the ticket checkpoint.

She heard there was a malfunction inside that almost caused a fire.

She was anxious and wanted to rush in to find someone.

Fortunately, Sophia came out safely.

Olivia hurried forward.

"Are you hurt? You scared me to death."

"I'm fine. Let's go. I'm tired."

Olivia nodded and was about to leave.

She suddenly saw Ethan and Isabella coming out.

"What bad luck. How do we run into them everywhere?"

Sophia glanced over indifferently.

"Just a coincidence. Let's go."

On the way back, Olivia grew angrier the more she thought about it.

She suddenly made a U-turn at an intersection.

Sophia was stunned.

"Aren't we going home?"

"No. I'm taking you to see the world."

"There are plenty of men. He's not the only one."

Sophia was confused.

At eight PM, the bar was noisy.

The smell of smoke mixed with perfume hit her.

The lights were dim, and figures moved through the crowd.

Sophia's casual outfit stood out.

A female singer sang a sentimental English song.

Olivia pulled her to a private booth upstairs.

She ordered whiskey and cocktails.

Sophia's face flushed after just a little alcohol.

Her cheeks felt warm.

"I'm going to the restroom."

Olivia waved her hand. "Hurry back."

Outside the restroom, she ran into Sebastian Evans.

Among Ethan's friends, she was only close with Charlie Lowell.

So she nodded politely.

"What a coincidence."

Sebastian seemed surprised.

"Alone?"

"With a friend."

"Ethan?"

Sophia's smile faded.

"No. I have to go."

"Clara." Sebastian stopped her.

The nickname made her uncomfortable.

"Yes?"

"Did you really break up this time?"

"Are there fake breakups?"

Sebastian's gaze was deep.

"I see."

Sophia turned and left.

He raised his phone and took a photo of her back.

He opened the group chat and sent the photo.

"Look who I ran into."

Charlie replied instantly.

"Sophia? Really?"

Julian Winston asked.

"At a bar?"

Charlie added.

"That bar we always go to."

Sebastian tagged him.

"Not saying anything? @Ethan Roscente"
###Chapter 20

Ethan Roscente sat in the restaurant.

Candlelight flickered.

Across from him was Isabella Langley, smiling brightly.

His phone screen lit up.

Sebastian Evans sent a photo.

It was a picture of Sophia Sullivan's back.

She was sitting on a bar stool.

Her long hair cascaded over her shoulders.

Ethan's expression darkened instantly.

Isabella cautiously asked, "Is something wrong?"

Ethan didn't answer.

His fingers tapped on the screen.

[Not my business]

Sebastian replied quickly.

[You really broke up?]

Ethan smirked coldly.

[Yeah]

Sebastian sent a surrender emoji.

[So you don't mind if someone asks her out?]

Julian Winston suddenly chimed in.

[You're going for it?]

Sebastian replied with a nodding GIF.

Charlie Lowell sent a string of "hahas."

Julian typed, "You're something else."

No one took it seriously.

Ethan typed expressionlessly.

[Suit yourself]

Sebastian put his phone away.

A dark glint flashed in his eyes.

...

9 PM.

Outside the Caltech dormitory.

Isabella held Ethan's hand.

"This was the best birthday ever."

She rose on her toes.

"Will you miss me?"

Her eyes sparkled.

There was a hint of a plea in her voice.

Ethan ruffled her hair.

"Get some rest."

Disappointment flickered in Isabella's eyes.

She still nodded obediently.

"See you tomorrow."

The car drove off campus.

Raindrops dotted the windshield.

A used blanket lay on the back seat.

It had a checkered pattern.

In a light tan color.

Sophia had bought an identical one.

She always complained his car was too cold.

That blanket had stayed folded on the back seat ever since.

No one had used it since.

A car horn shattered his memories.

The light turned green.

He pressed the accelerator hard.

The car sped toward the bar district.

...

The private room was hazy with smoke and alcohol.

Sebastian was drinking alone.

He raised an eyebrow when he saw Ethan.

"Shouldn't you be with your girlfriend?"

Ethan sat down.

"I took her back."

Sebastian handed him a glass.

"Burgundy. Try it."

Ethan took a small sip.

"Not bad."

His gaze swept the room.

"Where's Sophia?"

Sebastian swirled his glass.

"Looking for her specifically?"

Ethan's expression was cool.

"Just asking."

"Left ages ago." Sebastian shrugged. "She doesn't like it here."

Ethan's expression relaxed.

He stood to leave.

"Put it on my tab."

Sebastian watched his retreating back.

He murmured softly.

"Sorry, man."

...

Olivia Lopez was completely drunk.

Sophia called a ride.

It was late by the time she dropped her off.

The taxi stopped at the alley entrance.

Rain was pouring down.

Sophia prepared to dash through the rain.

"Sophia—"

Alexander Laurent approached with an umbrella.

"Planning to get soaked?"

He was wearing casual clothes today.

It made him seem less serious than usual.

Sophia nodded.

Alexander shoved the umbrella into her hands.

"Use mine."

"What about you?"

"I'll borrow one."

He ran toward the restaurant across the street.

He quickly borrowed an umbrella.

"Fixed their wiring once."

The rain had lightened slightly.

He opened his umbrella and stepped into the rain.

Sophia followed.

The streetlights were dim.

Lightning split the sky.

The wind howled.

She gripped the umbrella handle tightly.

She noticed he always kept two or three meters between them.

He deliberately slowed his pace.

Alexander glanced back.

"Keeping up?"

"Yeah."

Her pants were soaked to the ankles by the time they reached home.

After a hot shower, she changed into pajamas.

She made a cup of antiviral herbal drink.

The medicine tasted bitter.

Yet the image of that figure holding the umbrella surfaced in her mind.

Tall and straight.

Dependable.

Reassuring.
###Chapter 21

Sophia Sullivan buried herself in her studies.

The days were monotonous and repetitive.

Yet she didn't find them dull.

The phone's ring shattered the night's tranquility.

It was Professor Eleanor Watson.

"How's the studying going?"

Sophia reported her progress.

Eleanor Watson hummed in acknowledgment.

"Come to my house tomorrow morning."

The call ended abruptly.

As if afraid she might refuse.

Six in the morning.

Sophia tied on her apron.

The aroma of oatmeal porridge filled the kitchen.

She ladled out an extra portion.

Her neighbor hadn't returned all night.

Alexander Laurent pulling all-nighters at the lab was the norm.

The lock turned.

The man's figure appeared in the hallway.

His shirt was noticeably wrinkled.

Dark circles shadowed his eyes.

Sophia handed him a thermos.

"Oatmeal porridge. Good for the stomach."

Simmered all night.

Sweet and soft.

Alexander's stomach ached faintly.

The porridge was perfectly timed.

He accepted it with thanks.

Sophia's eyes curved into a smile.

"That rainy night."

"I should be thanking you."

Alexander raised an eyebrow.

"Just neighbors."

"Was on my way."

He noticed the bag in her hand.

"Heading out?"

"The professor needs to see me."

She glanced at the time.

Said a hurried goodbye.

The thermos warmed his palm.

Pumpkin had been added to the porridge.

Sweet but not cloying.

A plain boiled egg lay quietly in the container.

He slowly peeled the shell.

It tasted better than expected.

...

The morning subway was unbearably crowded.

Sophia was squeezed among the masses.

Breathing was difficult.

She finally fought her way out of the car.

Straightening her crumpled clothes.

The guard at the professor's complex recognized her.

Let her through without issue.

A stranger answered the door.

Henry Lorenz paused for a second.

Suddenly recalling the scene at the university gate.

The girl anxiously grabbing him, asking about the professor's health.

Eyes red-rimmed.

Eleanor Watson's voice came from inside.

"Is that Sophia?"

He stepped aside to let her pass.

Sophia changed into slippers.

She placed the water chestnut cake by the entryway.

The professor, wearing reading glasses, waved her over.

"Come help me find a book."

English gene sequence monographs were spread on the table.

Expanding fields in bioinformatics.

"That one about gene testing."

"I can't find it."

Sophia's eyes scanned the bookshelf.

Her finger paused on a deep blue cover.

"This one?"

Eleanor Watson slapped her thigh.

"That's it!"

"Your eyes are sharper."

The professor turned to Henry Lorenz.

"Use these materials for now."

"Let me know if you need more."

Henry accepted the thick stack of papers.

Eleanor Watson smiled as she introduced them.

"Sophia is my student."

"Soon to be my graduate student."

Henry understood.

"You're taking her graduate entrance exam?"

The professor nodded.

"This is Henry Lorenz."

"He's a second-year master's student."

"You can study together."

Sophia gave a slight nod.

"Nice to meet you, senior."

"I'm Sophia Sullivan."

Henry took out his phone.

"Let's exchange contacts."

"We can meet at the library."

"Discuss problems together."

He left in a hurry.

Sophia went into the kitchen.

She plated the water chestnut cake.

The professor's eyes lit up.

"The one from east of the city?"

"Impossible to get."

Sophia said lightly.

"I passed by."

Eleanor Watson saw through it.

"It's so far."

"And the lines are long."

Sophia linked arms with her.

"Wasn't long."

"Very quick."

The professor patted her hand.

"Go do the problems."

"Two specialized exam sets."

Sophia pouted.

"You called me here."

"Just for this?"

Eleanor Watson glared.

"To supervise your studying."

"Go on."

Her figure skipped lightly into the study.

A smile touched the professor's eyes.

Sophia stayed until evening.

Cooked a full table of dishes.

Only left after cleaning the kitchen.

Night deepened.

Her phone screen lit up.

A message from Henry Lorenz.

[Library tomorrow?]

Sophia replied.

[Okay.]

...

At the library entrance.

Henry Lorenz waited with breakfast.

He handed her steamed buns and soy milk.

Sophia finished them in a few bites.

They walked side by side into the reading room.

Seats were already saved on the second floor.

The elevator doors were closing.

Someone rushed in urgently.

Isabella Langley and her roommate squeezed into the elevator.
###Chapter 22

The alarm rang for the third time before Isabella Langley finally struggled to get up.

They were about to be late, so the two of them sprinted all the way into the library.

"What floor?" Sophia Sullivan asked, her breathing even.

"Second," Isabella panted, her hair disheveled.

The elevator doors opened.
Isabella glanced at the grad school prep materials in Sophia's hand.
Her expression turned curious. "You're studying at the library? Don't tell me you're applying for grad school?"

Sophia didn't respond.

Isabella chuckled softly. "Even current students can't get in. You've been out of school for years. You're really ambitious."

Sophia gave her a cool look. "Whether I get in or not is one thing. But when you say 'can't get in,' are you talking about yourself?"

Isabella's face instantly darkened.

She was a junior and hadn't seriously prepared for grad school at all.
Her roommates had started reviewing long ago.
But she was counting on Ethan Roscente to be her safety net.

Sophia's words had hit a raw nerve.

"What if I don't get in?" Isabella lifted her chin. "He said if I want something, he'll lay it all out for me."

Sophia didn't want to engage. "Then I hope you can stay that confident."

She turned and caught up with Henry Lorenz.

Her roommate stared after Sophia, curious. "Isabella, who was that?"

"Don't know her," Isabella said, turning away. "Let's go find seats."

She suddenly remembered something and grabbed her roommate's arm. "Do you know how to make oatmeal porridge?"

"There are tutorials online. Just look it up."

Isabella immediately downloaded a cooking app.
She spent the entire morning studying recipes.
She didn't turn a single page of her book.

Her roommate seemed to want to say something but ultimately stayed silent.
Isabella had a trust fund boyfriend, after all.
Why bother saying anything?

They left the library at noon.
Isabella went straight to the supermarket.
She came back with a pile of kitchenware and oats.

Her roommate was speechless.

Isabella declared with certainty, "Starting today, I'm going to be the perfect domestic girlfriend."

It wasn't like only Sophia Sullivan knew how to make porridge!

Her roommate had no response.

...

The night was deep.
###Chapter 23

The mansion was brightly lit.

Ethan Roscente returned from work, exhaustion written all over his face.

He had just gotten out of the car when Isabella rushed over. "Babe, I've been waiting for you forever!"

Ethan took half a step back, signaling for the driver to leave. "When did you get here?"

"This afternoon." Isabella reached out to give him a massage. "You look tired. Let me help you relax."

Ethan sidestepped her. "I'm not tired. Did you need something?"

Isabella pulled a thermos from an insulated bag. "You said you wanted some last time. I learned how to make it special for you. Want to try it?"

Ethan frowned as he unlocked the front door. "Come inside first."

This was Isabella's first time inside the mansion.

Her heart raced.
She took a deep breath and followed him in.

The décor was American style.
Muted browns and greys.
Understated luxury.
An authentic Qi Baishi painting hung on the wall.
Hermès logos were everywhere.
Even the trash can was LV.

Past the living room was an indoor garden.
There was a home theater, a gym, everything.
A set of golf clubs stood in the corner.

Isabella dug her nails into her palm.
The most expensive thing she'd ever seen before was a classmate's three-hundred-thousand-dollar Hermès bag.
Enough to buy an apartment back home.

But in this mansion, luxury brands were commonplace.

If she could just marry Ethan Roscente...

Ethan took a sip of the porridge and set the spoon down.

Isabella blinked. "Is it not good?"

"I already ate after work. I'll have some later." Ethan patted her head. "No classes today?"

"Finals are almost over. Not many classes. I was at the library studying for grad school." Isabella changed the subject. "I heard there's a meteor shower tonight. Want to go watch it with me?"

Ethan loosened his tie. "The news isn't always accurate. We'll see."

Isabella knew better than to push it.

"It's late," he said, standing up. "Let me drive you back to campus."

Isabella bit her lip.
She linked her arm with his.
Her low-cut dress hinted at what was beneath.
"Trying to get rid of me so soon?" Her voice was sweet, her gaze both innocent and seductive.

Ethan gave a low laugh. "My self-control isn't the best. I don't dare let you stay."

"Is there anything you don't dare do?" Isabella looked up at him.

"There is," the man said, a hint of a smile playing on his lips.

"Ethan, I actually don't have class tomorrow..." I could stay.

"Let's go," Ethan said, picking up his car keys. "Any later and the dorm matron will yell at you again."

Isabella stuck her tongue out and followed him.

At the doorway, she suddenly stopped.
###Chapter 24

"Ethan, you said there are things you don't dare do... Well, if I suggest one more thing, would you dare?"
Ethan raised an eyebrow.

Isabella pointed at the door lock.

She pouted, looking like a wronged puppy.

"I've waited for you so many times."

She extended her arm, showing the mosquito bites.

"Look, so many bites."

"Want to get bitten again next time?"

Ethan said flatly, "Can't bear to see it."

Isabella jumped up.

"I just want to register my fingerprint."

"So I can come find you later."

The man chuckled.

"Like a child."

He registered her fingerprint.

Remembering the oatmeal porridge she brought, he pulled out a supplementary card.

"Ten thousand a month."

"Buy whatever you like."

Isabella bit her lip.

"I can't take your money."

"A woman spending her man's money is only natural."

"Is that so..."

"Take it."

Isabella's eyes lit up.

"I'll bring more porridge tomorrow."

Ethan waved his hand.

"Don't."

It's not that taste.

No matter how many times I eat it, it's useless.

...

Sophia Sullivan and Henry Lorenz parted ways outside the library.

Henry had ranked first in the graduate entrance exams.

He had helped her highlight the key points.

She wanted to treat him to a meal.

But he had to leave early.

The June weather was growing warmer.

A wave of heat hit her face.

She only felt better after going home and turning on the air conditioning.

She opened the refrigerator.

Planning to make garlic broccoli.

Asparagus stir-fried with pork.

Corn and pork rib soup.

She wouldn't shortchange herself.

As the food was ready, there was noise outside the door.

She opened it to find only the cleaning lady.

"Anything wrong?"

Sophia shook her head.

"Nothing."

The next day, she arrived at the library on time.

She brought breakfast for Henry.

He hadn't accepted payment yesterday.

It was only fair she brought some today.

Henry scratched his head.

"Thanks, you're too kind."

She often sat by the window.

Good light, fewer people.

Ideal for studying.

But when she turned, she saw Isabella Langley.

Today she was alone.

Sophia paid no attention.

She took out her books and exam papers to practice.

Isabella fidgeted nervously.

Her gaze kept drifting over.

Sophia remained oblivious.

Her profile, as she turned the pages, was serene and beautiful.

Even Isabella had to admit.

She was breathtakingly beautiful.

Perhaps that was why Ethan couldn't forget her.

Isabella gripped her pen tightly.

Remembering that day in the haunted house.

Ethan had abandoned her and run to Sophia.

He had been truly panicked.

Now she was the official girlfriend.

She couldn't lose.

Henry set the study pace.

Sophia's efficiency improved.

She finished two practice exams by noon.

With a ninety-five percent accuracy rate.

Henry was surprised.

Even after three years since graduation, she was still this sharp.

No wonder the professor valued her.

Sophia got up to use the restroom.

Isabella immediately followed.

"Wait."

Sophia turned.

"Yes?"

"I brought him porridge last night."

"He finished it all."

Isabella smiled.

"He even asked me to stay the night."

"It was the first time I saw him so rough yet sexy."

"I didn't sleep all night."

She lowered her head, feigning shyness.

A sharp pain pierced Sophia's heart.

It was hard to breathe.

"Jealous?" Isabella moved closer.

"Regretful? You've missed your chance."

Sophia suddenly laughed.

"How do you know he's only done that with you?"

Isabella's face paled.

"Maybe you're just one of many?"

"And you won't be the last."

With that, Sophia turned and left.

Henry noticed she had been gone a long time.

He thought about messaging her, but she returned.

He saw her pale face.

"Everything okay? Not feeling well?"

Sophia dug her nails into her palm.

"Just a bit stuffy. Let's continue."

Henry nodded.

"Okay."

Study session ended at five in the afternoon.

Henry remembered yesterday's meal.

"There's a new hot pot place nearby."

"Want to go? My treat."

Sophia's mind was already elsewhere.

She shook her head.

"Not feeling well. Next time."

Henry didn't mind.

"Okay, I'll treat you next time."

...

Home, Sophia collapsed onto the sofa.

The little goldfish in the tank blew bubbles.

Watching the swimming fish, drowsiness washed over her.

She woke to darkness.

Eight PM.

Woken by hunger.

She slipped on her sandals and went to the kitchen.

Remembered the fridge was empty.

She forgot to buy groceries in the afternoon.

The supermarket was still open.

She grabbed her keys and went out.

The seafood section was lively with fish and shrimp.

She bought a snakehead fish.

Felt like having sour soup, went to the seasoning aisle.

Found the packaged pickled vegetables.

Reached out and touched a warm hand.
Sophia Sullivan's gaze fell on that hand.

Its knuckles were distinct, long and powerful.

Her eyes shifted slightly.

She saw the shopping cart piled high with pre-made meals.

Looking up, she met his downward glance.

Sophia curved her lips into a smile. "Professor Laurent, is this your dinner?"

Alexander Laurent cleared his throat softly. "Just something quick for late nights at the lab."

"The nutritional ratio is calculated. Protein, vitamins, carbs—all meet the standard."

His tone was as calm as if he were reporting data.

Sophia laughed. "Professor Laurent, even eating is so precise for you."

"But if you had to choose between a hot, freshly cooked meal and instant food, which would you pick?"

Alexander fell silent.

The answer was obvious.

Sophia's eyes curved into crescents. "I'll make dinner."

"The payment is helping me with a small favor."

Half an hour later.

Alexander stared at the fish on the cutting board. "This presents a difficulty."

Sophia rubbed her nose. "The supermarket usually processes it, but it's too crowded today."

"Maybe we should just—"

Alexander rolled up his sleeves and removed his glasses. "Let me try."

Sophia nodded.

Using pre-sliced fish for the soup would be easier.

But asking a physicist to slice fish was overkill.

Five minutes later.

She looked at the uniformly thin fish slices and took back her thought.

His knife skills rivaled a professional chef's.

"Does it meet the standard?" Alexander asked, wiping his hands.

"More than meets it! You could open a shop with that skill."

The corner of Alexander's mouth lifted slightly. "I've never cooked, but I learned dissection in biology."

Dinner was a steaming fish hot pot.

The side dishes Alexander bought covered the table.

After the meal, he cleared the dishes.

Sophia saw him to the door. "I'll take out the trash. You should rest early."

Alexander glanced at the time. It was almost midnight.

His night run plan was canceled.

Sophia expected to toss and turn, but she fell into a deep sleep quickly.

Seven the next morning.

Her phone screen lit up with a video call request.

Olivia Lopez was applying makeup, her brow furrowed. "I'm so jealous you get to go to the library. I have another blind date."

Sophia chuckled. "Want to come study with me?"

Olivia pouted. "I'd rather go on the blind date."

She knew she wasn't cut out for academics. Having one genius in the family was enough.

"The photos from last time are edited. Sending them to you now."

WeChat notification sounds chimed repeatedly.

Sophia swiped through the screen.

There she was, wearing a fox ear headband, her cheek pinched, expression dazed.

And a picture of Olivia looking disheveled right after getting off a roller coaster.

When she reached the last few solo photos, her finger paused.

Two familiar figures flashed in the background.

Isabella Langley and Ethan Roscente walked hand in hand.

She felt like an onlooker who had stumbled into someone else's world.

...

"Martha!"

Ethan Roscente curled on the sofa, his face pale.

Waves of stomach cramps assaulted him.

The mansion was empty. No one answered.

He rummaged through drawers looking for stomach medicine.

Only an empty box remained.

His hands shook as he dialed his assistant's number. "Bring me stomach medicine."

The assistant arrived quickly, handing him pills and water.

Ethan swallowed the pills. "You can go."

An hour later, the phone rang again.

"What kind of medicine did you buy? It's useless!"

The pain stripped away his patience.

The medicine box on the coffee table wasn't his usual brand.

The assistant apologized profusely. "What brand do you need, sir?"

Ethan suddenly went silent.

It was always Sophia who prepared it.

He never memorized the name.

He hung up the phone violently.

He pulled out that deeply memorized number.

"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable—"

He just remembered. She was still blocked.

The lock turned.

Martha entered carrying a grocery basket.

Ethan staggered to his feet. "Lend me your phone."

The moment the call connected.

A clear female voice came through. "Martha?"

All his questioning got stuck in his throat.

In the end, he only managed to squeeze out a hoarse whisper.

"My stomach hurts."
###Chapter 25

Sophia Sullivan held her phone.

The image of Ethan Roscente holding Isabella Langley's hand flashed before her eyes.

Her voice was calm. "Go to the hospital if you're sick."

"I'm not a doctor."

The call ended.

Without a moment's hesitation.

Ethan hurled the phone against the wall.

It shattered into pieces instantly.

Martha stood frozen.

It was her phone.

A sharp pain shot through his stomach.

Ethan gritted his teeth and went upstairs.

He slammed the bedroom door shut.

He refused to believe he needed her.

Martha looked at the broken phone.

She couldn't help but sigh.

Miss Sophia was such a good person.

The young master was truly foolish.

That afternoon, after finishing her cleaning, Martha knocked on the door.

There was no response from inside.

She shook her head and left.

Amelia Roscente drove to the Beverly Hills mansion.

She unlocked the door with her fingerprint.

"Brother? Mom wants you to meet Miss Clementson."

She dialed his number.

His phone rang in the living room.

He should be home.

She hurried upstairs.

"Brother? Are you in there?"

She knocked for a long time.

There was no movement.

Frowning, she called Martha.

"The young master never came out…"

"He looked very unwell…"

Amelia quickly found the spare key.

She pushed the door open.

Ethan was lying on the floor.

His face was deathly pale.

"Brother—"

The smell of hospital disinfectant was pungent.

Cold IV fluid dripped into his veins.

Ethan struggled to open his eyes.

"Water…"

Charlie Lowell quickly handed him a cup of water.

He moistened his cracked lips.

He shook his head, signaling to take it away.

"Ethan, you scared us to death."

"Suddenly fainting and ending up in the hospital."

Ethan scanned the hospital room.

Sebastian Evans and Julian Winston were both there.

Amelia looked worried.

Victoria Roscente had also come.

Only Sophia Sullivan was missing.

He gave a faint, bitter smile.

How heartless.

"What did the doctor say?"

Charlie cleared his throat. "A perforated ulcer…"

"From drinking too much…"

Amelia's eyes were red. "Brother, you almost gave me a heart attack…"

Victoria spoke with a dark expression. "Where is Sophia Sullivan?"

"She didn't even come when you're in the hospital?"

The room suddenly fell silent.

Ethan's face was expressionless.

Charlie and the others didn't dare to speak.

Sebastian said calmly, "They broke up."

Victoria frowned. "Is she still throwing a tantrum?"

Ethan interrupted coldly, "I was the one who ended it."

Victoria was stunned.

Amelia's eyes widened.

Victoria stormed out of the room.

She immediately called Sophia Sullivan.

She started yelling as soon as the call connected. "Who do you think you are?"

"My son favoring you was your good fortune!"

"How much money has he spent on you all these years?"

"He's sick now, and you're not rushing back?"

Sophia listened quietly.

She replied calmly, "I'm sorry."

"Your son is no longer any concern of mine."

She hung up and blocked the number.

She deleted his contact on WeChat.

She let out a long breath.

She had never felt so light and free.

Victoria listened to the busy tone.

She was trembling with anger.

When she called again, it was just a busy tone.

"How dare you, Sophia Sullivan!"

Henry Lorenz noticed the smile on her lips.

"Something good happen?"

Sophia shook her head. "Just resolved a bit of trouble."

Their study session at the library ended.

The sky had darkened.

The night breeze was cool.

The streetlights cast a dim glow.

Leaves rustled softly.

Henry looked at her profile.

He gathered his courage. "Can we have dinner together today?"

Sophia thought for a moment.

She really should thank him.

"I have food at my place."

"If you don't mind, would you like to try my cooking?"

Henry was taken aback.

"Your place?"

Sophia nodded. "It's very close."

"We can eat out if you prefer."

Henry quickly shook his head. "Home is good."

"Then I'll trouble you."
###Chapter 26

Sophia Sullivan pushed open her apartment door.

She went straight to the refrigerator.

There were quite a few ingredients left in the fridge.

Beef brisket with potatoes.

Sweet and sour ribs.

Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

And a simple stir-fried seasonal vegetable.

She tied on an apron and began preparing dinner.

Henry Lorenz stood at the kitchen doorway, watching in a daze.

"It's rare to find a woman who can cook these days."

Sophia didn't look up as she chopped the potatoes.

"Just a personal habit."

Henry glanced around.

The room was small but tidy and cozy.

The bookshelf was packed with professional books.

A physics book sat at the very end.

He quickly averted his eyes.

Four dishes and a soup were soon on the table.

The sweet and sour ribs looked enticing.

Henry took a bite.

His eyes instantly lit up.

"This tastes incredible!"

Sophia handed him a bowl of rice.

"Eat more if you like it."

The tips of Henry's ears turned slightly red.

"Whoever marries you will be very lucky."

As soon as the words left his mouth.

A rapid knocking came from the door.

Sophia frowned and put down her chopsticks.

"I'll get it."

The door was pulled open forcefully the moment she unlocked it.

Amelia Roscente grabbed her arm, trying to pull her away.

"Come with me to the hospital."

Sophia stood her ground.

"We've already broken up."

Amelia let out an incredulous laugh.

"My brother has a perforated ulcer! He's hospitalized!"

"Is this what you call love?"

"Just throwing away six years of feelings?"

"A mansion, designer brands, a Black Card... what did he ever deny you?"

She grew more agitated as she spoke.

He'd even given Sophia a Black Card, something she herself didn't have.

Sophia's expression remained calm.

"Are you done?"

Amelia was stunned.

"I'm not going."

"You!"

Amelia kicked the door hard.

"Remember what you said today!"

The sound of her high heels faded down the hall.

Sophia's knuckles were white.

Henry peeked out cautiously.

"Are you okay?"

Sophia turned and smiled.

"Another bowl of rice?"

The rest of the meal was unusually quiet.

Henry left in a hurry.

Sophia was halfway through clearing the dishes.

She suddenly lost her grip.

A porcelain bowl shattered on the floor.

She crouched down to pick up the pieces.

Her fingertip was cut.

A bead of blood welled up.

Tears fell without warning.

Six years had formed too many habits.

Hearing he was sick still made her worry.

But this time, she held back.

She would get used to it.

From love to weariness.

The cracks had been there for a long time.

The first broken promise.

The first lie.

Now it all seemed blurry.

Six years had passed in the blink of an eye.

...

Amelia stormed down the stairs.

Her high heel kicked a garbage bag.

She couldn't help but curse.

"What a dump!"

Her phone suddenly rang.

"Bro?"

At the hospital, Ethan Roscente had just woken up.

Charlie Lowell shrugged helplessly.

"I couldn't stop her."

Ethan had waited for forty minutes.

He'd drunk water three times.

Tossed and turned five times.

His eyes had scanned the doorway countless times.

He finally made the call.

"Where are you?"

Amelia hemmed and hawed.

"Out."

"When are you coming?"

"I was going back to get some chicken soup..."

"Is Sophia with you?"

Amelia was silent for a moment.

"No."

Ethan's voice turned cold.

"Who told you to go find her?"

"Don't you understand 'break up'?"

Amelia flared up.

"Fine! I was meddling!"

"She said it herself!"

"It has nothing to do with her if you die from your illness!"

The other end of the line went silent.

Only the dial tone remained.

...

In the hospital room, phone fragments were scattered across the floor.

Martha quietly tightened her grip on the new phone in her pocket.

This one couldn't be broken too.
###Chapter 27

Alexander Laurent dragged his exhausted body up to the seventh floor.

The extreme heat warning had been in effect for a week.

His experiment had finally achieved a breakthrough.

As his key slid into the lock, a dull thud came from the apartment opposite.

He paused, turned, and knocked on the door across from his.

"Sophia Sullivan?"

No response.

He knocked again.

Silence still emanated from within.

Frowning, he pulled out his phone, ready to call the police.

The door suddenly cracked open.

Sophia peered out from behind it.

"Yes?"

Her voice was calm, her expression normal.

But Alexander detected something off.

Like a rose on the verge of withering.

He adjusted his glasses.

"How's that paper you mentioned coming along?"

"It was submitted half a month ago," Sophia said flatly.

"Waiting for results now. Reviewing in the meantime."

Alexander pondered for a moment.

"I have a half-finished paper here. Would you like to see it?"

Twenty minutes later.

Sophia sat on Alexander's sofa.

She carefully read through the paper in her hands.

Her eyes gradually lit up.

It discussed the initial rate of change in biological systems.

The angle was novel, the methodology unique.

But it lacked experimental data support.

"You wrote this?"

Alexander nodded. "From my sophomore year."

Sophia felt a complex mix of emotions.

No wonder the professors still lamented his change of major.

His talent was truly astounding.

"Why wasn't it published?"

"I didn't think it was perfect enough."

Alexander pointed to a specific section.

"These two parts need more data support."

"After changing majors, I never had time to finish it."

A flicker of regret passed through his eyes.

Sophia was silent for a moment.

"Why show me?"

"Professor Eleanor Watson showed me your undergraduate thesis."

"I noticed you worked on a similar topic."

Alexander looked at her.

"Are you still interested in continuing?"

Sophia's heart suddenly beat faster.

Those deeply buried dreams seemed to stir awake.

She hadn't stepped into a lab since graduation.

"Could I?"

She was rusty, but remembered the procedures.

She just worried she couldn't keep up.

"If you want to, you can."

Alexander produced a flash drive.

"Next October, the Chinese Academy of Sciences' gene sequencing project will be recruiting."

"If you get into graduate school, you'll have a chance to join."

It was a rare opportunity.

Sophia took the drive.

"Thank you. I'll consider it seriously."

At ten o'clock, she stood to leave.

Alexander saw her to the door.

"You live right across the hall. No need for formalities."

Sophia gave a light laugh.

Alexander's gaze swept over her fingers.

"Don't keep the band-aid on too long. Remember to disinfect with iodine."

Sophia instinctively curled her fingers.

"Understood. Thanks."

Alexander turned and brought over a pot of pink succulents.

"These are for you."

Sophia's eyes brightened.

The plump leaves graduated from green to pink, utterly adorable.

"You're really giving them to me?"

"I passed by the florist the other day. This was the last one."

Alexander's tone was even.

"Consider it thanks for the fish last time."

Sophia accepted them with a smile.

"Friends don't need to be so formal."

"Next time, no more return gifts."

She blinked, starlight shimmering in her eyes.

"Okay," Alexander replied softly.

...

In the hospital room.

Julian Winston and Charlie Lowell visited early.

Julian shook slightly a thermos.

"Ethan, brought you some specially made oatmeal porridge!"

"My chef got up early to make it. Very nourishing!"

Charlie looked at the bowl of golden porridge, his mouth twitching.

Everyone knew Ethan Roscente hated porridge.

He wouldn't touch any except what Sophia Sullivan made.

Sure enough, Ethan took one sip and put down the spoon.

"Not eating. Tastes strange."

Julian raised an eyebrow.

"That picky? I think it's the cook, not the food."

"My chef isn't as thoughtful as your ex-girlfriend..."

Charlie coughed violently.

But it was too late.

Ethan's face turned cold. "Get out!"

Julian hugged the thermos.

"Fine, I'm going! With a temper that bad, no wonder Sophia isn't coming back!"

He made a quick escape.

Charlie chased after him, scolding.

"You know he's upset, yet you poke the sore spot!"

Julian pouted.

"Even you know Sophia is his weak spot."

"Yet he himself won't admit it."

"If he wants her to visit, he should just say so. Always playing tough!"

Charlie was speechless.

"Speaking of which, want to give him a push?"
###Chapter 28

Sophia Sullivan finished her morning run.

She stepped out of the shower.

A new pink succulent sat on her balcony.

She poked it gently.

Soft and tender.

Her mood lifted inexplicably.

Her phone vibrated on the table.

The screen showed Charlie Lowell.

She answered the call.

"Charlie? What's up?"

"Hey Sophia, how have you been?"

"Not bad. You?"

Charlie immediately straightened up.

"I... haven't been great."

Sophia frowned.

"What's wrong?"

"Stayed up late drinking. My stomach's upset." His voice was weak. "Sophia, I don't want anything else, just your special oatmeal porridge. I'm really craving it... Would that be okay?"

He didn't dare mention Ethan Roscente.

This was his roundabout way of asking.

Sophia and Charlie had a good relationship.

He had asked.

She checked the time.

"It's fine. I'll go buy groceries now. You can pick it up at noon."

"Thanks, Sophia! You're the best! I'll text you later."

Sophia chuckled softly.

...

Noon.

Charlie drove to the area near MIT following the address.

He turned down several alleys.

Found the building.

Seventh floor. No elevator.

He looked up.

Swallowed hard.

Five minutes later.

He stood panting before the door.

Sweat dripped from his forehead.

Sophia opened the door and handed him water.

"Rough climb?"

Charlie waved a hand.

"Exhausting, Sophia. Why do you live somewhere so out of the way?"

He almost said shabby.

Caught himself just in time.

"It's quiet. Convenient."

She brought out the prepared porridge.

"Just made it. Eat it while it's warm. There's some side dishes too, careful not to spill."

Charlie opened the lid.

A fragrant aroma wafted out.

No wonder someone missed it so much.

He nodded.

"Got it. Thanks, Sophia. I'll treat you to a meal later."

As he left, he hesitated and turned back.

"Sophia, you..."

Sophia lit up her phone screen.

"It's one o'clock. I need to head out. Should I walk you down?"

The unspoken words died in his throat.

Charlie nodded.

"Okay."

Sophia watched the sports car drive away.

The smile faded from her lips.

She had a good idea what Charlie wanted to say.

But right now.

She didn't want to hear it.

...

Hospital room.

Charlie placed the thermal container down.

"This one will definitely hit the spot."

Ethan Roscente opened the lid suspiciously.

Took a taste.

His expression softened.

Talked so tough.

Acted so final.

Yet still softened in the end.

He took another spoonful.

Glanced toward the door.

"Where is she?"

"Who?" Charlie was confused.

"She made this, right? Had a change of heart? Is she coming back?"

Ethan raised an eyebrow and snorted.

"What does she think this is? A hotel? A restaurant? Come and go as she pleases?"

Sebastian Evans sat on the sofa.

Watched Charlie's awkwardness.

A faint, amused smile played on his lips.

"Well, you really don't need to worry about that. Charlie lied and said he wanted it. That's why Sophia made the porridge. She definitely isn't coming herself."

Ethan's face darkened instantly.

He shot a cold glare at Charlie.

"Did I tell you to go? Who said you could take matters into your own hands?"

Charlie shrank back.

Cleared his throat softly.

"I was just worried about your health. You haven't eaten much these past few days. If it weren't for Sophia's porridge, you'd still be starving..."

Ethan remained silent, his expression cold.

"By the way, the place Sophia lives now is really small and run-down. No elevator. She climbs seven floors every day. Must be tough." He spoke while watching Ethan's reaction.

Noticed that although Ethan said she deserved it.

A flicker of concern passed through his eyes.

Hmm.

Still couldn't let go.

Charlie was about to continue.

A cooing "Baby~" came from the doorway.

Charlie and Sebastian shuddered.

Goosebumps covered their arms.

Isabella Langley hadn't received any messages for days.

His phone was unreachable.

She only found out Ethan was hospitalized with a bleeding ulcer after asking Julian Winston.

She panicked immediately.

Skipped class and rushed straight to the hospital.

Seeing Ethan pale in a hospital gown.

Her lips quivered and tears fell.

"Baby~ I'm sorry I just found out you were hospitalized. Are you hurting anywhere else? You look awful. Should I call a doctor?"

The rapid-fire questions were annoying.

Even more irritating was her incessant crying.

Not only was Ethan exasperated.

Charlie and Sebastian found it noisy too.

Ethan rubbed his temples.

"I'm fine now. Please stop crying."

He suddenly missed the days with Sophia.

If it were her.

And he was sick.

No matter how upset, she would have everything arranged methodically.

Isabella was good at reading moods.

The moment Ethan's expression shifted.

She knew to pull back a little.

Her sobs quieted to soft sniffles.

Eyes red.

Full of worry and heartache.

Ethan saw she had stopped talking.

Just looking at him with tear-washed eyes.

His heart softened.

"My illness was sudden, but it's not serious. I'm okay now. You should head back to school."

Isabella pressed her lips together.

"Are you sure you don't need me to stay? I can make some oatmeal porridge..."

Charlie burst out laughing.

He went through so much trouble to get this porridge.

And now another volunteer offering to make more.

Was it really that funny?

Isabella didn't usually interact much with Charlie and the others.

His laugh made her notice the other people in the room.

Hearing it, she felt a spark of anger.

It's just porridge.

What's so funny?

Ethan understood.

Frowned and spoke flatly.

"It's not necessary. Go back to school."

Isabella heard the impatience in his voice.

Didn't dare argue.

Said a meek "okay" and left.

Once she was gone.

Sebastian, who had been silent, stood up.

"Are you going to finish that porridge?"

Ethan wanted to say no.

But finally, looking at the bowl.

His face dark, he said coldly.

"Who said I wasn't going to drink it?"
###Chapter 29
The library lights were soft.

Sophia Sullivan finished two exam papers.

She couldn't solve the final problem.

She frowned in thought.

She remembered a similar problem in a reference book.

She stood and walked to the lending section.

Her fingers brushed over the book spines.

She quickly found her target.

She was about to leave.

A book nearby caught her eye.

"Recombination and Fusion of Gene Sequences."

She recalled Alexander Laurent's words.

She pulled the book out and flipped through it.

The more she read, the more surprised she became.

The viewpoints highly aligned with her own ideas.

She became immersed in the book.

Her phone vibrated, pulling her from her thoughts.

A new WeChat message popped up.

Olivia Lopez: [Guess where I am?]

Sophia typed a reply: [You came to school?]

[Bingo!]

She closed the book.

She hurried downstairs.

Olivia Lopez stood under a tree.

She held a food container.

"I was passing by and brought you something."

A delicious aroma wafted from it.

Sophia took it. "Not staying to eat together?"

Olivia waved a hand. "I'm too busy."

She rubbed her temples.

"This new project is killing me."

"Only eight hours of sleep in three days."

"I just woke up and my dad called me in."

She was a designer.

She took few commissions, but each was difficult.

This one was a last-minute emergency.

"It's related to the Roscente family." She winked.

"Not interested." Sophia cut her off.

She shoved an umbrella into Olivia's hands.

"Remember your sunscreen."

She turned and went back to the library.

Olivia raised an eyebrow.

She looked at the documents with the Roscente name.

A smile played on her lips.

Hospital room.

Ethan Roscente pulled out his IV.

A bead of blood welled up.

He pressed a tissue to it.

He put on his jacket to leave.

A nurse tried to stop him.

"Mr. Roscente, you can't be discharged!"

He gave her a cold look.

The nurse fell silent.

He drove home.

His phone rang incessantly.

Victoria Roscente was calling.

He hung up directly.

He turned on airplane mode.

The world became quiet.

He walked into the kitchen.

The cookware was shiny and neatly arranged.

He remembered Sophia Sullivan making congee.

She always soaked the rice ahead of time.

She woke up early to simmer it over a low flame.

He said it was too much trouble.

She persisted anyway.

Later, he grew accustomed to her kindness.

The front door opened.

Martha walked in.

Victoria had sent her to take care of him.

"Make some oatmeal porridge." He gave the order and went upstairs.

Martha sighed.

She tied on an apron and entered the kitchen.

She brought the porridge upstairs when it was ready.

Ethan was already asleep.

His brow was furrowed tightly.

His face was pale.

Martha set the bowl down quietly.

She cleaned up and left.

In the middle of the night.

Ethan's body burned with fever.

A searing pain tormented his stomach.

Victoria arrived.

She felt his forehead; it was scalding.

She urgently called the family doctor.

"The fever is caused by his stomach condition." The doctor took his temperature.

"Take this medicine on schedule."

Victoria noted the instructions.

A nurse changed the IV bottle.

Ethan opened his eyes.

He borrowed a phone to make a call.

He dialed a memorized number.

It connected after two rings.

His Adam's apple bobbed.

No sound came out.

Sophia was half-asleep.

She answered the phone.

"Hello?"

Silence on the other end.

She opened her eyes, drowsy.

Thinking it was a wrong number.

She was about to hang up.
###Chapter 30
The silent night was broken by a low murmur over the phone.

"Clara, I'm in pain."

A subtle tremor laced the man's voice.

Sophia Sullivan's heart clenched.

Ethan Roscente always pushed himself too hard, never admitting weakness.

Drinking until his stomach bled, skipping meals during overtime—these were routine for him.

Once, Sophia had poured her heart into nursing his health back.

She meticulously prepared three meals a day and even learned massage techniques specifically for him.

It took a long time to finally heal his stomach issues.

In return, he found her bothersome, even snapping that she was acting like his mother.

Those buried memories resurfaced, but her pang of heartache was fleeting.

Her voice was cold. "I'm not a doctor. Go to the hospital if you're in pain."

Ethan's knuckles were white, but he persisted. "I want the porridge you make."

Silence stretched between them, a quiet battle of wills.

Finally, Sophia ended the call.

Ethan remained frozen, phone in hand, his expression grim.

A nurse asked tentatively, "Sir, are you alright?"

He didn't answer, just closed his eyes wearily.

...

Early the next morning, Sophia was already up.

She called Charlie Lowell.

"Feeling better? Still want some oatmeal porridge?"

Half-asleep, Charlie jolted awake at her voice.

"Sophia! Your porridge was amazing. I'd love more!"

Sophia didn't expose his pretense, simply telling him to come by on time.

Her relationship with Ethan was over. This was all she could do.

...

Ethan rested at home for a few days, gradually recovering.

Isabella Langley visited his Beverly Hills mansion daily, bringing porridge each time.

He always told her to leave it, saying he'd have it later.

Today was no different. Isabella set down the porridge and snuggled close.

"Baby, I'm so glad you're better. I've been so worried."

Ethan smiled faintly. "No classes lately?"

She pouted playfully. "I skipped them. My boyfriend comes first."

Ethan froze for a second.

He remembered when he first started dating Sophia.

He had wanted her to skip class to be with him, but she had firmly refused.

They had given each other the silent treatment for three days before he finally apologized.

After that, their dates often happened during her lectures.

He would watch her study, never tiring of her focused expression.

How did two people who loved each other so much end up like this?

His gaze grew distant, as if looking through Isabella at someone else.

Noticing his distraction, she shook his arm. "Baby, what's wrong?"

He snapped back to reality. "I'm fine now. Focus on your classes. You don't need to come by anymore."

"The company is busy. I won't have time for you."

Isabella nodded with a smile, but it vanished the moment she stepped outside.

Hesitating briefly, she called Julian Winston.

"Julian, Ethan seems upset. Did Sophia do something again?"

Julian, busy flirting at a bar, answered offhandedly, "She just made porridge a couple times."

Isabella gritted her teeth, her eyes turning icy.

The next morning, she found Sophia in the library.

"Ethan is my boyfriend. Please keep your distance."

Sophia looked up from her problems, amused. "Don't worry. I have no interest in stealing him away."

After Isabella left, Sophia returned to her work.

At dusk, she ran into Henry Lorenz outside the library.

She still felt bad about their last meal being interrupted by Amelia Roscente.

"Let me properly treat you to dinner today. I'll cook."

Henry's face lit up with surprise. "I'd love that."

They walked away chatting and laughing, unaware of the black sedan watching from a distance.

Ethan gripped the steering wheel, his knuckles white.

He had waited all day, only to see her laughing happily with another man.

And it wasn't even the same man from the restaurant.

If her goal was to make him jealous, she had succeeded.

Ethan followed their car, trailing them to a shabby, narrow alley.

The walls were stained and peeling, moss grew in patches, the atmosphere was oppressive.

Charlie had mentioned she lived modestly, but he never imagined it was this bad.

The car couldn't fit down the narrow lane, so he got out and followed on foot.

The two ahead remained completely unaware.
###Chapter 31

Henry Lorenz truly lived up to being Professor Eleanor Watson's most valued student.

His research focus differed from Sophia Sullivan's.

Yet they found an unexpected rapport discussing academics.

A smile touched Sophia's eyes.

She was currently preparing for her graduate school entrance exams.

Her foundational knowledge was already solid.

But she lacked understanding of cutting-edge research directions.

This required extensive reading of academic papers.

As a current graduate student, Henry naturally had an advantage over her, who had left campus years ago.

They stood talking in the hallway.

Neither noticed the gloomy gaze fixed on them from behind.

Ethan Roscente clenched his fists.

His nails dug deeply into his palms.

She had been so cruel to him.

No matter how he pleaded, she refused to come see him.

Yet here she was, smiling so happily with another man.

Sophia had prepared a table full of sumptuous dishes.

There was a variety of cuisines.

Henry stared, dumbfounded.

"All this food... just for the two of us?"

Sophia's lips curved into a smile.

"You've helped me so much."

"Of course I need to thank you properly."

Henry scratched his head, slightly embarrassed.

"I really didn't do much."

"You're far more impressive than I imagined."

He had noticed during their study sessions.

Sophia's learning ability was exceptional.

She understood concepts immediately.

Never needing to be taught twice.

"It's not just the studying."

"Thank you for helping me find research papers."

"And for getting me access to the MIT library."

Henry's eyes widened in surprise.

"You're still reading papers?"

He finally understood why Professor Watson thought so highly of her.

Henry stayed for a while after dinner.

Seeing it was late, he got up to leave.

Sophia walked him downstairs.

She took the trash out with her.

"The food was delicious, thank you."

"You're welcome."

"Well then..." Henry scratched his head, "See you at the library tomorrow?"

"Okay."

Alexander Laurent was returning from the lab.

He happened to see the two standing in front of the apartment building.

His gaze swept over Henry.

He looked somewhat familiar.

"From MIT?"

"Professor Laurent! I'm from the School of Life Sciences."

"I took your Fundamental Principles of Physics course last semester."

"Hmm."

Sophia wanted to greet him.

But Alexander walked straight upstairs.

Henry rubbed his hands together excitedly.

"I didn't know Professor Laurent lived here too!"

"His classes are so hard to get into."

"My roommate couldn't get a spot."

"I heard mostly girls manage to enroll..."

Alexander reached the corner.

He glanced back downstairs.

That guy...

Henry Lorenz, was it?

First time he'd seen Sophia bring someone home.

Boyfriend?

He chuckled softly and shook his head.

None of his business.

After seeing Henry off.

Sophia turned to throw the garbage in the alley.

A dark figure suddenly rushed out from the side.

Grabbing her wrist forcefully.

Sophia shuddered in fright.

She was about to struggle.

But then she heard a familiar voice.

Sarcastic and biting.

"Getting bold, aren't we, Sophia Sullivan."

"One wild man after another."

"Playing quite the field."

The man's tone turned abruptly dark.

"Who was that guy just now?"

"What were you doing upstairs?"

Sophia's smile vanished instantly.

Her wrist ached from his tight grip.

She struggled hard.

But was no match for the man's brute strength.

The more she struggled.

The tighter he held.

"Ethan Roscente, let go!"

"Answer me first!"

Sophia winced in pain, frowning.

"What's it to you?"

"An ex-boyfriend showing concern for his ex-girlfriend's love life."

"Is that so wrong?"

Sophia looked up with a cold laugh.

"So you do remember you're the ex-boyfriend."

"Then what are you doing here?"

Ethan was speechless.

"...Can't I just be passing by?"

An old man's cursing came from the alley entrance.

"Who blocked the road with their car?"

"Think you're something special with a sports car?"

"Absolutely no manners!"

Ethan: "..."

The Porsche being yelled at was indeed his car.

Sophia couldn't be bothered to ask more.

She finished throwing the trash and turned.

"Even if I have someone new."

"One, two, three, or four."

"It's none of your business."

"We've broken up."

"I don't need to explain what 'broken up' means, do I?"

"Your future has nothing to do with me."

"Please don't interfere with my present or future either."

She paused.

"Let's just be strangers."

"I don't know how you found this place."

"But please don't come again."

"I don't want your girlfriend to misunderstand."

"Since you chose to make it official with her."

"Please be devoted to her."

Sophia had been hurt herself.

She didn't want Isabella Langley to go through the same thing.

Youth should bloom freely.

It shouldn't be trampled on.

Everyone must take responsibility for their choices.

Ethan chose Isabella.

She chose to break up.

They both needed to move on.

Ethan stood frozen in place.

Not reacting for a long time.

Sophia turned and left.

Ethan watched her retreating figure.

For the first time, he felt a pang of panic.

It was as if something was slipping away.

He wanted to grasp it.

But was powerless.

"...Are you serious, Sophia Sullivan?"

"Yes." She didn't look back.

"You've said that before too..."

They had fought many times.

But never once had he felt this panicked.

She said "break up" so calmly.

As if she really wouldn't look back.

Ethan reached out, wanting to stop her.

But couldn't utter a single word.

He was the one who brought up the breakup.

He was the one who let go first.

Sophia returned home.

She sat quietly on the sofa.

Ethan showing up.

Didn't surprise her.

Compared to their rushed breakup last time.

This felt more like a real farewell.

After Sophia left.

Ethan stood downstairs for a long time.

Until the old man threatened to call the police to tow his car.

He had no choice but to leave.

"So the car is yours!"

"I've been yelling forever, are you deaf?!"

Ethan slammed the accelerator.

He sped back to the Beverly Hills mansion in twenty minutes.

Martha was simmering soup in the kitchen.

The loud noise made her jump.

She turned to see Ethan storm through the living room, radiating anger.

He went straight upstairs without a word.

Martha's heart sank.

What set him off this time?
###Chapter 32

He pushed open the bedroom door.

Ethan Roscente frantically yanked open the wardrobe.

He rushed into Sophia Sullivan's walk-in closet.

Designer handbags were neatly arranged.

High-end gowns remained untouched.

The watches and jewelry he had given her lay quietly in their velvet boxes.

Not a single item was missing.

His gaze abruptly fixed on the cherry bracelet.

His breath hitched.

A terrifying ferocity churned in the depths of his eyes.

It was from their third year together.

A birthday gift he had specially brought back from abroad.

Cherry in English is 'cherry'.

It sounds like 'cherish'.

It symbolized treasuring someone.

She was the one he cherished most.

Back then, she adored it.

She wore it day and night, never taking it off.

Now, even this was left behind.

As if she had completely stripped away her love for him.

Ethan collapsed onto the edge of the bed.

He suddenly realized.

Sophia was never just throwing a tantrum.

Every word she said was meant.

She was serious.

She wanted a clean break.

...

"Crash—"

Martha downstairs heard the tremendous noise.

Frightened, she hurried upstairs.

She nearly collided with Ethan as he stormed out of the walk-in closet.

The man's face was terrifyingly dark.

"Young Master..."

She called out timidly.

He left without even a backward glance.

Martha turned to look into the walk-in closet.

She gasped.

The valuable jewelry cabinet was smashed to pieces.

Clothes with tags still attached were scattered everywhere.

The Bohemian rug was a complete mess.

She had just finished cleaning the kitchen.

She had thrown out that pot of spoiled oatmeal porridge.

Now she had to deal with this bedroom disaster.

Martha thought to herself.

Is a worker's life not a life?!

...

The psychedelic lights swayed.

A tacky song blared loudly.

In the center of the dance floor, men and women were grinding against each other.

In a corner booth.

Ethan Roscente was downing whiskey by himself.

Glass after glass.

It seemed less like drinking and more like venting.

Dim light fell across his face.

His sharp features were shaded with a cold aloofness.

It added a dangerously sexy aura.

Women passing by were drawn to his presence.

Ignoring his clear "stay away" vibe.

They inched closer, tempted.

"Handsome, drinking alone is so boring. Let me keep you company..."

The woman wore a low-cut top.

Leaning forward slightly revealed a generous view.

Her cleavage was enticing.

Any normal man would sneak a second look.

Ethan only gave a cold glance. "Get lost!"

His gaze was deep and frightening.

The woman fled in terror.

After shooing away the annoying pest.

He continued drinking.

A bottle of whiskey was soon finished.

He signaled a server.

In his daze, he caught a glimpse of a familiar figure.

He chased after it like a madman.

Grabbing the woman's arm roughly.

"Soph—"

The woman turned. Seeing a handsome man, her anger melted into a sweet smile as she pressed closer. "Looking for me, handsome?"

Only then did Ethan realize he'd mistaken her.

He frowned, pulling his hand back.

Sophia would never be so forward.

"Sorry, wrong person."

The woman pouted, disappointed.

Watching his retreating back, she muttered, "Turning down an offer like that... is he even a man?"

This place was foul and chaotic.

He couldn't stand it any longer.

He finished the last of his drink.

Picked up his jacket and stood to leave.

Just as he reached the exit, someone called out—

"Ethan!"

Julian Winston excitedly clapped his shoulder. "When did you get here? Why didn't you say hi? We have a private room upstairs, join us for a drink?"

Ethan rubbed his temples. "No more. You guys have fun."

Watching him leave, Julian was puzzled.

He never missed these gatherings before.

Could it be... he made up with Sophia Sullivan?

Right, just got back together, probably can't mess around.

"Julian, what are you looking at? We're only missing you."

Someone called from near the stairs.

Julian shook his head, not thinking further.

He turned back into the noise.

...

He returned to the Beverly Hills mansion by 10 PM.

The bedroom and walk-in closet had been tidied by Martha.

Sophia's things were neatly put away again.

He turned and went to the study.

The wall-to-wall bookshelf was filled with biology textbooks.

Although Sophia didn't pursue a Master's degree.

She never slacked in her field.

She often spent entire days sitting in this study.

These books were all left by her.

She had once proudly boasted.

Which books were out of print.

Which were original editions she had photocopied.

How painstakingly she had categorized them.

She always smiled with curved, happy eyes when talking about her achievements.

He stared heavily at the wall of books.

Suddenly, his eyes darkened, and he smirked coldly.

Ethan went downstairs and found Martha, who was about to leave. "Lend me your phone."

Martha instantly became wary. "Young Master, you broke my phone last time..."

"Didn't you buy a new one?"

Martha hesitated.

"Hand it over."

"I just bought it..." It would hurt if it got smashed!

Ethan said, "I'll have someone deliver two iPhone 16s later."

"Alright!" Martha immediately beamed and handed over the phone.

He turned and called Sophia Sullivan.

Before she could speak, he said first:

"Since you want a clean break, come take away that junk in the study. You have one day. If you don't move it by tomorrow, I'm throwing it all out."

Sophia was stunned.

She quickly understood he meant the professional books.

"...Okay."

She hung up after saying that.

Ethan held the phone.

Hearing the busy tone.

The line of his mouth tightened more and more.

...

Sophia remembered the books were very heavy.

She couldn't move them alone.

She called Olivia Lopez.

"Olivia, are you free tomorrow? I have some books at Ethan Roscente's mansion. Can you drive over and help me move them?"

Olivia naturally agreed. "Sure. You put so much effort into those books. Leaving them with that bastard is a waste. I'll pick you up tomorrow morning."

"Okay."

The next day.

She didn't wait for Olivia.

Instead, Alexander Laurent arrived.

Alexander usually wore dress shirts and slacks.

Exuding a scholarly air.

But today, he wore a simple white T-shirt with light blue jeans.

His soft black hair fell across his forehead.

He looked like a young college student.

"Why is it you? Where's Olivia?" Sophia asked, surprised.

"She overslept. Asked me to come help at the last minute."

Sophia sighed.

No need to guess.

That girl definitely partied too hard last night and couldn't get up.

Well, some help is better than none.

"Thank you for your trouble."
###Chapter 33
Alexander Laurent's car glided smoothly down the road.

Silence filled the interior.

Sophia Sullivan turned her head to gaze out the window.

Her mood was visibly low.

Alexander slowed the car.

He glanced at her through the rearview mirror.

The security guard at the gated community recognized Sophia.

"Miss Sullivan, you're back?"

Sophia offered a strained smile.

Alexander didn't press further.

The car stopped in front of the Beverly Hills mansion.

Sophia unbuckled her seatbelt.

"I'll just grab my books. I'll be quick."

Alexander nodded. "Need any help?"

"No, it's not many books."

She pushed the door open and stepped out.

Martha opened the door, her face lighting up with surprise.

"Miss Sullivan!"

Sophia explained softly, "I'm just here to pick up a few things."

Ethan Roscente appeared at the top of the staircase.

He was wearing pajamas and holding a coffee mug.

"Coming alone to move your books?" His tone was laced with sarcasm.

Sophia ignored him, walking straight toward the study.

Ethan followed close behind her.

The books in the study were neatly arranged.

Sophia pulled out a canvas tote and began packing the books.

She handled them carefully, avoiding any damage.

Ethan leaned against a bookcase, watching her coldly.

After ten minutes, she tightened the drawstring of the bag.

Just as she was about to leave, Ethan suddenly snapped.

He kicked the bag away and grabbed her shoulders.

"Sophia Sullivan, do you think I'm dead?"

She winced in pain, struggling. "Let me go!"

Ethan's eyes were red. "You refused to come back before, but now you show up for some stupid books?"

"You're the one who broke up with me!" She shoved him away forcefully.

Ethan, provoked by her resistance, advanced on her.

Sophia stumbled backward, falling onto the couch.

He loomed over her, looking down at her flushed cheeks.

Memories of their intimate nights together flooded his mind.

He lost control and kissed her.

Sophia turned her head away in panic. "We're broken up!"

Ethan pinned her down on the couch.

He tore at her clothes.

Sophia desperately clutched the hem of her shirt. "Don't do this…" Her voice trembled with fear.

Ethan's hand slid under her skirt.

"What kind of woman do you want that you don't have?"

"I can call Isabella Langley for you…"

Ethan sneered. "Stop playing the chaste virgin. It's not like we haven't slept together before."

Sophia shook with anger. "You bastard!"

He gripped her chin. "What man would want a woman who's been with someone else?"

Tears streamed down her face.

She looked at the man she had loved for six years and felt only strangeness.

Ethan bent down to kiss her again.

He ripped open her blouse.

She was crying. He was smirking.

Sophia gave up resisting, overwhelmed by despair.

Suddenly, the weight on her lifted.

Alexander had pulled Ethan off of her.

Ethan crashed into a bookcase before steadying himself.

Alexander had grown concerned after her long absence and came inside to check.

Hearing the commotion, he rushed upstairs.

The scene he witnessed shattered his composure.

He took off his coat and draped it over Sophia's shoulders.

As he helped her sit up, she was still trembling.

"Sophia!" he called out, his voice steady.

Her gaze was unfocused, unresponsive.

He called her name a third time before she finally registered his presence.

"Professor Laurent…" Her voice was choked with sobs.

Alexander gently stroked her back, offering comfort.

Ethan watched them with a dark expression.

"So it's you. What number backup are you?"

Before he could finish his sentence, a fist connected hard with his face.
###Chapter 34

Ethan Roscente threw a punch at Alexander Laurent.

"Who the hell do you think you are?" he roared. "When she and I were together—"

Alexander caught his fist with ease.

He was unnervingly calm compared to Ethan's fury.

Only his eyes held a glacial coldness.

"And you?" Alexander's voice was icy. "The persistent ex? Or the criminal?"

Each word was a knife, plunging into Ethan's heart.

"You're dead—" Ethan struggled violently.

Alexander's grip didn't budge.

"Enough." Sophia Sullivan stood up.

She pulled Alexander's coat tighter around herself, her fingertips still trembling.

She didn't look at Ethan.

Facing Alexander, she kept her eyes downcast. "Professor Laurent, I'm sorry you had to see this."

Alexander frowned. "Should we call the police?"

Sophia was silent for a moment.

"...No," she said softly. "Let's just go."

"Alright." Alexander respected her decision.

He didn't want to intrude too much into her personal affairs.

"These books..." Sophia pointed to the burlap sack on the ground. "Could you help me carry them? I don't have the strength right now."

Alexander lifted the sack with one hand.

His other hand supported Sophia.

Ethan stood rooted to the spot, watching them leave.

He viciously kicked over a nearby potted plant.

In the car, Sophia watched in the side mirror.

The mansion grew smaller and smaller.

Six years, ended just like that.

When she first moved in, her heart was full of hope.

They picked out furniture together. They planted a garden...

She never imagined it would end this way.

From now on, that house had nothing to do with her.

The person inside it was now a stranger.

Sophia rolled down the window.

The wind tangled her long hair.

Exhausted, she leaned back against the headrest and closed her eyes.

Alexander remained silent.

He glanced at her occasionally in the mirror.

Noticing she had fallen asleep, he pulled over near MIT.

He quietly looked out the window.

Sophia's sleep was light.

But she was too tired. She needed the rest.

Sensing his consideration, she opened her eyes.

"Earlier... thank you," she said quietly. "I've troubled you again."

Alexander replied, "It was nothing."

Sophia pressed her lips together.

She wanted to thank him for more than that.

No matter how disheveled she was, he never pried into her privacy.

He preserved her last shred of dignity.

"Gurgle—"

A faint sound emerged.

The tips of Sophia's ears turned red. She covered her stomach.

She hadn't eaten anything since morning.

The adrenaline had masked it, but now she was ravenous.

Even though she tried to hide it, Alexander heard.

"It's been a while since you ate at the MIT cafeteria, right? Would you like to try it?"

Sophia blinked.

Fifteen minutes later, they walked into the cafeteria.

The MIT cafeteria was famous.

Three buildings, covering cuisines from all over.

It even had international food.

Sophia used to love the Chinese food on the second floor.

The server there always smiled and gave her an extra scoop of meat.

From a distance, she could see that window.

The server was still there.

Three years after graduation, she wondered if the woman would remember her.

Sophia got in line.

The server was busy dishing out food, not looking up.

But the plate she handed over was piled high.

Sophia smiled. "Thank you."

Alexander paid.

They found a place to sit.

"It still tastes just as good," Sophia remarked.

The chef's skills might have even improved.

"I always missed meal times because of experiments," she recalled. "She would always save a drumstick for me."

Alexander remembered the server's expression warming the moment she saw Sophia.

Sophia stirred her food, suddenly feeling like talking.

"I didn't get along well with my roommate," she said. "Besides Olivia and Professor Watson, the cafeteria server was the kindest to me."

"And now, there's you."

Alexander's movements paused slightly.

Sophia continued, "School is better. Quiet. Pure. Deciding to go back for my master's might be the best decision I've ever made."

...

After eating, they took a walk around campus.

They followed the gravel path, passing under the grape arbor.

A cool breeze brushed their faces. The lake shimmered with light.

They found themselves at the unnamed lake.

The lotus flowers had wilted, but their leaves still floated on the water's surface.

Tired, Sophia found a stone bench and sat down.

Alexander silently sat beside her.

"The wind here feels so nice," she said softly.

She leaned back on her hands, watching the lotus leaves drift on the waves.

Her mood gradually calmed.

Alexander said, "MIT has good environmental policies. The lake is clean. It is pleasant to sit here and enjoy the breeze."

Sophia was quiet for a moment.

"About what happened earlier..." she began.

"He was your ex-boyfriend?" Alexander asked.

Sophia turned to look at him.

The man adjusted his glasses, his gaze frank. "My apologies. I couldn't help overhearing your conversation before I entered the study."

Sophia gave a faint smile. "Yes. We just broke up. It was very ugly. Sorry you had to witness that."

Understanding flickered in Alexander's eyes behind his lenses.

Remembering the mention of six years during the argument, he had a guess.

But he didn't press further.

He just suddenly understood that the Henry Lorenz he saw that day wasn't her boyfriend.

As the sun set, they drove back.

Alexander helped her carry the books to her door.

As they parted, he handed her a tube of ointment. "I bought this on the way. It will help you heal faster."

Sophia was taken aback.

She guessed he bought it while she was asleep.

She took the ointment and pressed her lips together.

"Thank you."
###Chapter 35

Sophia Sullivan carefully arranged the bag of books.

She placed each volume on the shelf, a fine sweat beading on her forehead.

After her shower, the ointment sat quietly on the coffee table.

She unscrewed the cap and stood before the full-length mirror.

A cotton swab dabbed with ointment gently smoothed over the bruise.

The minty fragrance spread, the pain gradually fading.

She intended to read, but a splitting headache took hold.

She slipped beneath the covers and quickly fell into a deep sleep.

Deep in the night, a nightmare struck.

Ethan Roscente lunged at her. She struggled desperately.

She woke with a start, her chest heaving.

In the darkness, she fumbled for her phone.

She called Olivia Lopez's number, but no one answered.

Fingers trembling, she glanced toward the neighboring balcony.

The light was still on.

After a moment's hesitation, she opened WeChat.

["Are you asleep?"]

The wait felt eternal. Just as drowsiness reclaimed her, the phone vibrated.

["Yeah."]

Another message popped up.

["Look out your window."]

Sophia looked up. Stars glittered in the night sky.

["Straight ahead, the zigzag shape is the Gemini constellation."]

Her phone continued to buzz.

["Ancient Greek legend says twin brothers hatched from a golden egg. The elder brought misfortune, the younger was blessed by the goddess of love."]

["The elder grew jealous of the younger, plotting against him multiple times. The younger willingly sacrificed himself, leading to the elder's remorse."]

["After death, they became a constellation. Twelve stars connected, the most beautiful yet hardest to find."]

["You're seeing a rare sight. Feeling any better?"]

A slight smile touched Sophia's lips.

That text must have taken ten minutes to write.

But indeed, her mood had lifted.

She replied: ["Thank you. Much better."]

Alexander Laurent looked at his phone, a faint smile gracing his mouth.

He was about to return to his report when another vibration came.

["Under the same sky, watching the stars with you makes me happy. Goodnight—"]

…

The study in the Beverly Hills mansion was brightly lit.

Ethan Roscente stared at the empty bookshelf, the scene from daytime replaying in his mind.

Sophia Sullivan leaning into Alexander Laurent's embrace.

He violently smashed a glass.

A WeChat notification chimed. A message from Isabella Langley.

["Babe, finished work? Miss you so much, haven't seen you in days~"]

["I made plans for our date next week, okay?"]

A final message popped up:

["Can I come over now?"]

Ethan froze.

Sophia had said it was over.

What was he holding onto?

Isabella was his girlfriend.

["Come over."]

Isabella saw the message and sat up in surprise.

She’d hinted before, but he’d always been indifferent.

This time, he agreed.

She quickly changed and headed out.

Her roommate asked curiously, "Isabella, where are you off to so late?"

"‘The spring night is worth a thousand pieces of gold.’ Only that tall, rich, handsome boyfriend gets our campus belle this eager," her gaming roommate teased.

Isabella's cheeks flushed.

Ethan had never touched her, fueling her insecurity.

If tonight succeeded…

She would truly be his woman.

She’d specifically worn matching lingerie.

The taxi stopped before the villa.

The gate swung open automatically. A hand pulled her inside.

The man pressed her against the wall, his kiss descending.

Isabella froze for two seconds before responding awkwardly.

They kissed their way to the living room, tumbling onto the sofa.

Ethan pressed down, his kisses growing fervent.

His hand slid under her shirt, roaming and caressing.

Isabella's heart raced, anticipating the next step.

When his fingers brushed the black lace, Ethan suddenly stopped.

"What's wrong?" Isabella asked, bewildered.

The man rolled off and sat up. "Sorry. Get up."

Isabella felt like she’d been plunged into ice water.

"Ethan… did I do something wrong?"

She reached for him, but he caught her wrist.

Ethan's cold gaze swept over her. "Don't make me repeat myself."

Isabella pressed her lips together and sat up, not daring to utter a word.

Ethan straightened her dress, his tone softening. "Be good. It's late. The driver will take you back."

The driver arrived swiftly.

Isabella looked at the man's retreating back. He never turned around.

Biting her lip, she left.

Ethan lit a cigarette, smoke curling around him.

Sophia's face surfaced in his mind.

He closed his eyes and dialed a number. "Where are you?"

Julian Winston was with a girl and signaled for quiet.

"Can't sleep at this hour?"

"Find me a clean woman. I need to blow off steam."

Julian was stunned.

Weren't he and Sophia back together?

Daring to play with fire like this?
###Chapter 36

"Finally came around?" Julian Winston sprang up from the couch.
"Done playing monk?"

Ethan Roscente didn't look up.

His fingers tapped the sofa armrest.

"Just playing a part."

Julian clapped.
"I'll arrange it for you right away. Absolutely clean."

The call ended.

Five minutes later, an address arrived.

[Golden Jade Palace 1080]

[Been watching her. Untouched. A gift for you.]

Ethan smirked.

He grabbed his jacket and left.

The night was thick as ink.

A night of pleasure was worth a fortune.

The next noon.

Julian emerged from the next room, ruffling his hair.

His bathrobe hung loosely.

Golden Jade Palace was a Winston family property.

This exclusive suite was larger than a standard apartment.

He was desperately thirsty.

Pouring a glass of red wine, he paced the living room.

He encountered a woman's slender back.

Her snow-white shoulders and neck were marked with ambiguous red traces.

Her gaze at Ethan was sorrowful and heartbroken.

The man remained unmoved.

He handed her a check and sent her away.

Ethan looked up.

He met Julian's teasing eyes.

Julian leisurely lit a cigarette.

"That look would melt any heart. How could you be so cold?"

Ethan scoffed.
"Payment settled. No pity needed."

"True." Julian raised his glass.
"Want some?"

"No."

Drinking in the early morning.

Only Julian would do that.

The tobacco glowed.

Ethan took a deep drag.

His features were indifferent amidst the swirling white smoke.

A night of indulgence.

Yet no sense of release was found.

Julian leaned in.
"Not afraid Sophia Sullivan will cause a scene?"

Ethan frowned.
"Just an ex-girlfriend. Is she worthy?"

Hiss!

So they really weren't back together.

"What about Isabella Langley? Fresh and right in front of you, yet you go for outsiders?"

That girl's figure and looks weren't bad.

Though her气质 couldn't match Sophia's.

She was young and tender.

But he.

Preferred wild game.

Ethan blew a smoke ring.
"Good girls are trouble."

Julian laughed.
"Why weren't you afraid of Sophia being trouble back then? She seemed the type to take things seriously."

Ethan froze.

After a long moment.

"Yeah. That's why it took six years to shake her off."

Julian burst out laughing.

"Only you would say that."

...

Mid-October.

Sophia Sullivan received an email about her SCI preliminary review passing.

Olivia Lopez shrieked.
"Oh my god! Miaobao, you're amazing! That's SCI!"

Sophia sighed.
"It's just the preliminary review. There's a long way to go."

"With your level, the re-review will definitely pass. Don't worry."

"Well... To celebrate passing the preliminary, let me treat you to a meal?"

Sophia smiled.
"I should be treating you."

Olivia raised an eyebrow.
"Sisters don't keep score. It's settled. I'll pick you up right away."

The call ended.

Sophia opened her wardrobe.

She chose a V-neck floral dress.

Two months had passed.

Her hair had grown to her collarbones.

The weather was hot.

She tied it up with a matching hairband.

Half an hour later.

A message from Olivia said she was downstairs.

Changing shoes and grabbing her bag, she went down.

The car was parked at the alley entrance.

While waiting, she glanced up unintentionally.

She saw Alexander Laurent approaching.

A boy with a crew cut walked beside him.

His backpack looked sunny.

The two were talking softly.

Alexander nodded occasionally.

After finishing, the boy turned and left.

Olivia waved.
"Bro!"

Alexander looked up.

His gaze behind his glasses was calm.
"What are you doing here?"

"Taking Mia out to eat. That just now... your student?"

That boy was handsome and gentle.

His dimples when he smiled hit all her aesthetic points.

Alexander glanced at her.
"A graduate student from another school. Came to ask some questions."

She wanted to ask more.

Footsteps sounded on the stairs.

Sophia had arrived.

Alexander adjusted his glasses.
"You guys eat. I'll head out first."

Olivia tried to stop him.
"Join us?"

"Need to get back to the lab."

He had come back to retrieve something.

Sophia hadn't reached the first floor yet.

But she had already heard Alexander's voice.

After their last meeting, he had been buried in the lab.

It had been a month since they last saw each other.

In the stairwell.

Alexander stood on the third step.

Sunlight filtered through the diamond-shaped wall patterns.

Dappled light fell around him.

His cool eyes seemed warmed.

Their eyes met.

Sophia said softly,
"I washed your jacket a long time ago. Just haven't had a chance to return it."

The floral dress made her skin seem whiter than snow.

Nude high-heeled sandals.

Fresh and clean.

Alexander was momentarily dazed.

Then he remembered that jacket.

His voice was slightly hoarse.
"I've been staying at the lab recently. Came back today to get something."

Sophia noticed his tiredness.
"Go ahead with your work then. Remember to rest."

"Okay."

As they passed each other.

Sophia hadn't worn heels in a long time.

She missed a step.

Her body lurched forward.

Alexander swiftly steadied her.

His hand supported her waist.

Sophia, startled, patted her chest.

Belatedly, she caught a scent of pinewood.

It was his unique fragrance.
###Chapter 37

His jaw was nearly touching the top of her head.

If he hadn't reached out to steady her in time, she would have tumbled right into his arms.

Sophia Sullivan took two quick steps back.

Alexander Laurent's Adam's apple bobbed. He withdrew his arm, his voice low. "Heels are easy to trip in."

He paused. "Flats are safer."

A soft laugh escaped Sophia. "Thank you."

Olivia Lopez's voice called from outside the stairwell. "Clara? Is that you?"

Sophia glanced toward the sound. "I should go."

"Mm."

Alexander's hand clenched at his side. He turned and went upstairs.

His footsteps echoed in the empty stairwell.

Clear voices drifted up from below.

"What took so long?"

"A minor mishap."

"Did you see my brother?"

Olivia only knew Alexander lived nearby, not that they were neighbors.

Sophia gave a noncommittal hum.

Seeing her expression was normal, Olivia didn't press. She eagerly began discussing dinner options.

They settled on a Thai restaurant.

Over the meal, Olivia brought up the aftermath of her blind dates. "Those trust fund brats are utterly insufferable."

Everyone in their circle knew she loved to party. Her sudden turn to arranged meetings had many waiting for a spectacle.

The reluctant bachelors forced to meet her weren't pleasant either, hinting she should settle down and be a proper homemaker.

She had scoffed. These useless men, with no ambition of their own, thought everyone else was just coasting through life?

"In a fit of anger, I aired all their dirty laundry." Olivia snorted. In the same social circle, everyone knew each other's secrets.

Sophia wasn't surprised. Olivia had always been swift to exact revenge. "No wonder the gossip columns have been so lively lately."

News of infidelity scandals and tax evasion had reached even her, buried in her studies.

"Serves them right." Olivia sighed. "My family is among the top tier, and I have an older brother to carry the legacy. Yet my parents still nag me constantly about marriage."

"Don't even get me started on my aunt. She's practically gone gray worrying over my cousin's marital status, trying every trick to push him."

Sophia faltered. Alexander was being pressured to marry?

She found it hard to picture.

"But my cousin is hardly ever home. My aunt doesn't even get the chance to pester him." Olivia shrugged. "I'm just curious what kind of woman could ever capture the heart of someone so... detached..."

Sophia suddenly remembered the scene in the stairwell.

He seemed aloof and distant, yet he was attentive and considerate. The warmth of his palm had been startling.

Just how exceptional would the person who won his affection be?

...

Time flew.

It was already December.

The day of the graduate entrance exam arrived.

The winter in the city was damp and bitterly cold. A week of predicted rain and snow finally materialized. After last night's freezing rain, a thin layer of ice coated the roads.

On exam day, Sophia bundled up in a thick down coat, scarf, and gloves. She specifically wore anti-slip winter boots before heading out.

She did a final check of her admission ticket and stationery, ensuring everything was in order.

Olivia had joked about wearing a qipao for good luck, a play on words for a successful start. But after pulling two all-nighters for work, she couldn't get out of bed.

Sophia scanned the area outside the exam hall. As expected, no sign of Olivia, but she wasn't disappointed.

True friendship never needed forced maintenance.

The exam lasted two hours. Upon handing in their papers, some looked thrilled, others worried. Sophia walked out with a calm expression.

A light drizzle fell outside. Taxis were scarce, so she decided to take the subway home.

She had only taken a few steps when someone called her name.

"Sophia Sullivan?"

She looked up to see Amelia Roscente standing under the eaves. "I thought it was you."

Amelia hadn't seen her since the incident where she tried and failed to take her to the hospital.

Over half a year had passed. Her brother and Sophia truly hadn't gotten back together.

Even their mother, Victoria Roscente, who initially believed they wouldn't really break up, was starting to waver.

Amelia often heard her mother mutter—

"Why does Ethan keep having stomach problems lately? He didn't end up in the hospital this often when he was with Sophia Sullivan."

"Amelia, do you think it's really over between them this time?"

"Is that Sophia Sullivan out of her mind? There's a limit to playing hard to get. Does she even want to marry into our family?"

Victoria had looked down on Sophia for years, but now that they had truly split, she felt oddly uncomfortable.

Amelia also found it hard to accept.

It wasn't that she supported the relationship. She just couldn't accept that Sophia was the one who ended it.

She had learned the details of the breakup from Charlie Lowell. Her brother had flaunted his new girlfriend right in front of Sophia. No wonder she snapped.

Now she truly believed these two would not reconcile.

"Amelia." Sophia smiled in greeting.

Amelia noticed the clear plastic pencil case in her hand, recalling their chance meeting at the library. "You actually went through with the exam..."

Like her mother, she thought Sophia was just putting on a show to win her brother back. She never expected her to actually go through with it.

Sophia nodded. "Graduate school was always my dream. I missed my chance before. I'm trying to fight for it now."

Amelia studied her, a frown forming. "You only started studying after the breakup, right?"

"Yes."

"In such a short time, I'm afraid..." She thought the chances were slim.

This year saw a record number of exam takers. Competition for a top school like MIT was fierce.

Sophia had been out of school for years and hadn't worked in her field. Cramming at the last minute would likely yield predictable results.

A story of self-improvement after a breakup was nice, but success in these exams required more than just determination.

Amelia didn't have the heart to crush her hopes and left her sentence unfinished.
###Chapter 38
Sophia Sullivan caught the underlying meaning in her words and offered a faint smile.

Amelia Roscente asked, "You did your undergrad at MIT, right? Where are you aiming for grad school?"

"Still MIT," Sophia replied.

"Masters or PhD track?"

"Masters."

"What field?"

"Biology."

Amelia raised an eyebrow. It was the same specialization she had chosen. "Have you picked a target advisor?"

Sophia nodded calmly. "Professor Watson."

"Eleanor Watson?"

"Yes."

Amelia recalled seeing Sophia working as a housekeeper at Professor Watson's home last time. Her expression turned subtle. "You don't actually think... cleaning her house will make her more likely to accept you, do you?"

"That was an unexpected situation," Sophia stated.

"Unexpected? Let me be frank. Professor Watson is a titan in her field. Her standards are extremely rigorous. She's advising many PhD candidates lately, with very few spots for Masters students."

Amelia paused. "It's incredibly difficult to become her student. I'm applying to her program too. You might think I have an ulterior motive, but I'm advising you to consider another advisor. Your scores aren't out yet. There's still time to contact other professors."

She felt she had done her due diligence.

"Thank you," Sophia said with a slight nod. "I should get going."

She turned and left.

Amelia was left speechless. That was it?

...

Warm air circulated through the subway car at five PM. Sophia's frozen fingers gradually thawed.

Her phone rang from inside her bag. She pulled off her gloves and saw the caller ID. A smile touched her lips. "Professor."

"How did the exam go?" Professor Watson's voice was gentle, like a casual inquiry.

"I answered everything I knew," she replied honestly.

"I never worry about your exams," the professor said with a laugh. Sophia's undergraduate major courses were nearly perfect. Her foundation was solid.

"It's cold out. Head home early. Don't catch a chill."

"I'm on the subway now. I heard your leg is acting up again? I bought some medicine. I'll bring it by after my exams."

Eleanor Watson had injured her leg when she was younger. It pained her terribly every winter.

It had improved after acupuncture two years ago, but the pain had returned this year.

"Alright, I'll be home all week."

Professor Watson glanced at her calendar. Saturday would be perfect for dinner.

Sophia looked up. Her stop had arrived.

She ended the call and pushed through the rush hour crowd, exiting through Gate 2.

The moment she stepped out, a bitter wind hit her, nearly knocking her off her feet.

A pair of hands steadied her firmly. A shadow fell over her. She looked up and saw Alexander Laurent. Her eyes lit up. "What are you doing here?"

"Had to pick up some documents from home. The roads are slick, so I didn't drive. Took the subway instead," Alexander said, helping her regain her balance.

They walked side by side.

"How was the exam?"

"It went pretty well," Sophia replied.

Alexander gave a faint smile and didn't say more.

Winter nights came early. The streetlights flickered on before seven, casting a warm glow on the chilly evening.

The walk from the subway to MIT led through a commercial street lined with various small stalls.

As they crossed the overpass, they heard a vendor calling out, selling sweet potatoes. Sophia rubbed her wind-stung eyes and turned to Alexander. "Wait for me a second."

Alexander stood still. Two minutes later, she returned holding two steaming sweet potatoes.

"Here."

The hot potato released puffs of steam as she broke it open. She took a careful bite. It was scaldingly sweet. She blew on it gently, tasted a small piece, and her eyes curved into happy crescents upon tasting the sweetness.

She turned and asked, "Is yours sweet?"

Alexander nodded. It was the first time he'd had a sweet potato this sweet.

Sophia felt a small surge of pride. "I've always been lucky. I always pick the sweetest ones."

Her smile was infectious. The corners of Alexander's lips lifted slightly, a faint warmth shimmering in his eyes.

They reached home by seven. The warmth from the radiant floor heating greeted them as they entered.

Sophia carried her books and pens into the study.

Several books lay on the desk. She organized them one by one onto the shelves. Among them, she found a German original text Alexander had lent her last week.

She took the book and knocked on his door next door.

Alexander had just showered. His hair was still damp. He came to the door at the sound of knocking.

"The book you lent me last week. I forgot to return it," she said.

A faint scent of mint lingered in the air. Sophia's heartbeat quickened inexplicably.

Alexander took the book and noticed a note贴 attached. He was very familiar with her handwriting. A determined-looking Q-version character, wearing a headband, was drawn in the lower left corner.

Sophia saw the smile on his face and noticed the bookmark she'd left. She hurriedly pulled it off. "Just a silly doodle."

Seeing his smile deepen, she changed the subject. "Are you free soon? Now that exams are over, I'd like to treat you to dinner. To thank you for all your help lately."

She hadn't properly thanked him for his help with the grad school applications, or the matter with the mansion before that.

Alexander looked at the girl's earnest expression and didn't refuse. "How about at home? I prefer your cooking."

Sophia smiled. "How about tomorrow? My last exam is in the afternoon. I'll go grocery shopping after, and you can come over after you finish at the lab."

"Alright."

The rain had stopped the next day. As Sophia emerged from her final specialized exam, she saw a few rays of sunlight breaking through the clouds.

She went to the supermarket first, then took a cab home.

At six o'clock, a knock sounded at the door.

Sophia opened it. Alexander changed into the men's slippers she had prepared and walked familiarly into the kitchen to help.

Sophia handed him the vegetables that needed washing. "Same as always. Your department."

She turned to start chopping.

Alexander watched her back, a slight curve forming on his lips. "Okay."

He suddenly realized that this kind of life, though unfamiliar, felt strangely... anticipated.
###Chapter 39

The Saturday sun was bright.

Sophia Sullivan had worked up a sweat during her morning run.
She returned home, took a quick shower, and changed her clothes.
Then she gathered the medicine and headed to Professor Eleanor Watson's house.

"Professor, this medicine needs to be taken three times a day."
"It doesn't require refrigeration in cool weather."
"Remember to heat it up before drinking."

Professor Watson feared nothing in the world.
Except the bitter taste of herbal medicine.

She stared at the bowl of dark brown liquid.
She silently inched backward.
She couldn't help but try to protest one more time.

"Is it absolutely necessary?"

"It is mandatory," Sophia stated firmly.
"I've already instructed the housekeeper."
"She will supervise you to ensure you take it on time."

Professor Watson's face fell immediately.
"Fine."

She couldn't just disregard her student's thoughtful gesture.

Seeing the professor's childlike expression, Sophia's lips curved into a subtle smile.
"The medicine is quite bitter, I know."
"That's why I specially brought Mung Bean Cake from that bakery on Newbury Street."

"Have a piece after you finish the medicine."
"It will help counteract the bitterness."

The previously sullen expression instantly brightened.
"That's more like it."

After some casual conversation, Professor Watson got down to business.

"Next year, MIT's School of Life Sciences plans to form an experimental research team."
"Three spots have already been confirmed."
"Two more are needed."

"The selection criteria are extremely strict."
"Applicants must have excellent grades and a high overall GPA."
"They must also have received an 'A' grade on at least two separate experimental score."

Sophia was surprised.
She hadn't realized the barrier to entry for the team was so high.

Professor Watson noticed her hesitation and patiently explained.
"Being selected for the team offers extra credit at the end of the semester."
"Outstanding members can qualify for direct admission to the Ph.D. program."
"Alternatively, they might receive an offer from Ninhai Biotech's R&D company."
"They could join their laboratories."

Ninhai Biotech was highly prestigious.
Its reputation extended beyond the country, reaching international acclaim.

Their labs boasted the most advanced equipment and top-tier research teams.
They had produced numerous significant research result.
They were revered as a "sanctuary for scientific research."

Sophia recalled Alexander Laurent's previous hints.
So he had known about this opportunity all along.

"I am well aware of your academic record."
"I have never had concerns about your capabilities," Professor Watson said gently, looking at her.
"What you currently lack is hands-on laboratory experience."

Sophia had barely set foot in a lab these past few years.

Her operational proficiency, technical dexterity, and familiarity with new equipment were all potential issues.

Beyond innate talent, extensive practice time was crucial.

There was a reason Alexander spent all his time buried in the lab.

Skill improves with practice.

Experience accumulates over time.

Suddenly, a pair of warm hands grasped hers.
Sophia looked up into the professor's encouraging eyes.
"Starting now is still perfectly manageable."

A wave of warmth spread through Sophia's heart.
She nodded solemnly.

"I'm not worried about your graduate school entrance exams."
"The test is still months away."
"First, focus on thoroughly mastering the materials I've given you."

Professor Watson also had an experiment that had been initiated five years ago.
It had yet to yield any significant results.

She planned to have Sophia join it once the new semester began.
This project had originally been tailor-made for her.
It was just that things had taken an unexpected turn...

Fortunately, everything was finally getting back on track.

Sophia understood the professor's deep care and high expectations.

"Please don't worry."
"I will absolutely not disappoint you."

…

Upon returning home, she immediately began studying the materials she had brought back.

Compared to standard exam preparation textbooks, these materials involved specific operations and research findings.
They demanded a higher level of practical lab experience.
They were also considerably more difficult to comprehend.

Before she knew it, she was reading late into the night.

Sophia rubbed her tired, sore eyes.
She was just about to rest.
She had just lain down when she heard frantic pounding on her door.

"Sophia Sullivan—Open the door! I know you're home!"

Even through the living room and bedroom doors, Ethan Roscente's voice came through clearly.

"Bang—Bang—Bang—"

The knocking grew louder and more insistent.

Remembering how he had almost forced himself on her last time at the Beverly Hills mansion, Sophia's lips turned pale.

She clenched the corner of the quilt tightly.

"Sophia Sullivan—"

"Open the door—"

"Clara—"

She covered her ears, hoping he would leave if he got no response.

But five minutes passed, and Ethan was still pounding on the door.
He made it clear he wouldn't stop until she opened it.

The old apartment building had poor soundproofing.
Causing such a disturbance in the middle of the night was bound to anger the neighbors!

Sure enough—

"Who is it? Making such a racket in the middle of the night! Don't you people need to sleep?!"

"Where did this mad dog come from, barking like this?"

"Get lost now, or we're calling the police!"

Helpless, Sophia threw off the covers and got out of bed.
She dragged her slippers and walked to the door.

"Ethan Roscente, what is wrong with you?!" she hissed through gritted teeth.

"...I knew you were there."

"So what?!"

"Open the door. Let me in."

"On what basis? Who do you think you are? You can't just come in whenever you want!"

Ethan gave a wry smirk.
"Fine. Then I'll just keep knocking."

"You—"

"I'm knocking—"

Left with no choice, Sophia unlocked the door.

Ethan shoved it open violently, afraid she would change her mind a second later.

The man reeked of alcohol.
His cheeks were flushed.
He swayed unsteadily, looking like he might collapse at any moment.

Sophia frowned and took three cautious steps back.

"What do you actually want?"

Ethan stared at her with bleary, drunken eyes, saying nothing.

After what felt like an eternity, he suddenly spoke softly.
"Clara, come back..."

Sophia shook her head, pulling her coat tighter.
"You know that's impossible."

"It's been six months. Isn't that enough?"

"Ethan, I'm not throwing a tantrum. Do you understand that?"

"I don't get it—What do you want? Just tell me! An apology? Atonement? Kneeling on a keyboard? Kneeling on a durian?"

This was the furthest limit of his concession.
It was his greatest act of humility.

In past arguments, he had never softened his stance like this.

Yet Sophia still shook her head.

"Enough! Don't push your luck!"

Ethan roared, then gasped for breath.

"You were willing to open the door. That means there's still a chance for us."
"Tell me, name your conditions! I'll agree to anything!"

Ethan gritted his teeth.
He has already conceded this much.
What more did she want?

Sophia: "I let you in to avoid disturbing the neighbors. That's the only reason."

"You were the one who said breakups should be clean and decisive."
"So what are you doing now?"

Ethan advanced two steps, trying to grab her shoulders.

The woman recoiled in horror, her eyes filled with fear.
"Don't touch me—"
###Chapter 40
Ethan Roscente stood frozen.

Fear flashed in Sophia Sullivan's eyes.

She took two steps back.

"Don't come any closer!"

"Sophia..." Ethan's voice was hoarse. "That day, I..."

"Shut up!" Sophia cut him off. "Please leave."

The man's eyes reddened.

He remained rooted to the spot.

"I'm sorry."

"I shouldn't have treated you that way."

"I just missed you too much."

"Come back with me, okay?"

Sophia let out a cold laugh.

"Go back to being the other woman?"

Ethan said urgently, "I'll break up with Isabella Langley."

Sophia shook her head.

"I refuse."

Ethan took a step forward.

Sophia quickly retreated into her bedroom.

The door slammed shut.

Everything outside gradually grew quiet.

Sophia cautiously opened the door to check.

Ethan was asleep, leaning against the wall.

...

Morning sunlight streamed into the living room.

Ethan opened his eyes.

His head was splitting.

He looked around.

The room was small but tidy.

Sophia emerged from the bedroom.

Their eyes met.

"Awake?"

Ethan rubbed his temples.

"Last night..."

Sophia's expression was blank.

"You showed up drunk, banging on the door in the middle of the night."

"You disturbed the neighbors."

Ethan frowned.

He didn't remember any of it.

Sophia's lips curved into a cool smile.

"Please don't ever do that again."

"Adults should know better."

Ethan scanned the room.

A mocking smile appeared on his face.

"This dump."

"I wouldn't come back even if you begged me."

He grabbed his jacket and stormed out, slamming the door.

...

At the mouth of the alley.

Ethan made a call.

"Come out for a drink."

Charlie Lowell soon arrived at the bar.

"Bro, were you up all night?"

Ethan continued pouring drinks.

"Cut the crap."

Charlie raised his hands in surrender.

They drank from day into night.

Charlie hailed a cab to take him back to the Beverly Hills mansion.

While settling him in, he heard drunken muttering.

"Sophia..."

Charlie shook his head helplessly.

He should have thought of that sooner.

...

Sophia gave the room a thorough cleaning.

Her study schedule was completely disrupted.

She managed to complete two sets of practice problems at home.

For dinner, she made herself some sushi rolls.

By the time she finished cleaning up, it was already eight in the evening.

Her phone suddenly vibrated.

A friend request notification appeared.

The note read: Sebastian Evans.

Sophia accepted, puzzled.

There was no message for half an hour.

She returned to her studies.

...

Back at the bar.

Sebastian put his phone away.

Charlie had returned.

"Get him home safe?"

Charlie nodded and took a drink.

"Almost ran into Mrs. Roscente."

"She's been visiting the mansion a lot lately."

Sebastian swirled his glass.

"Come join us when you're done."

Charlie suddenly remembered something.

"Is Sophia done with her exams?"

Sebastian replied casually.

"She finished the day before yesterday."

Charlie laughed.

"You remember clearly."

Sebastian smiled.

"I've always paid attention to details."

Charlie gave a thumbs up.

"True financial elite."

"Are those two still not back together?"

Sebastian's tone was flat.

"It's inevitable."

Charlie's eyes lit up.

"Should I organize a celebration?"

"Maybe help patch things up between them."

Sebastian took a sip of his drink, hiding a smile.

"Good idea."
###Chapter 41

Charlie Lowell dialed Sophia Sullivan's number.

"Sophia, how have you been? There's something I'd like to discuss with you…"

He explained his reason for calling.

Silence lingered on the other end of the line.

Charlie quickly reassured her. "Don't worry, Sophia. It's just a casual dinner among friends. I won't invite Ethan."

"...Alright." Sophia finally agreed.

He ended the call and raised an eyebrow.

That's what he said, but if they happened to "bump into" someone, it wouldn't be his fault.

Sebastian Evans volunteered. "I'll notify Julian."

"Perfect! It's settled then!"

Charlie rubbed his hands together, already envisioning himself as the chief architect of this success.

…

Sunlight broke through the clouds, casting a golden glow.

Charlie had reserved a private room at Taste of Home in advance.

This place used to be their old haunt.

The moment Sophia entered, Charlie waved enthusiastically.

A server guided her to her seat.

"Sophia, congratulations on finishing your exams."

"I've already ordered. All your favorites. We must celebrate today."

Though Charlie's family background wasn't as prominent as the others, he was the most outgoing.

He had helped her a few times, and their friendship had gradually deepened.

"Thank you. I've always remembered your kindness."

Charlie laughed. "It's been so long. Why so formal?"

He snapped his fingers, and the dishes began to arrive.

"Charlie? What a coincidence." A deep voice came from above.

Charlie looked up, his smile freezing instantly.

His eyes moved to the person behind Sebastian.

Where was Ethan?

What about the planned "chance encounter"?

Why was there a different person?

"...What a coincidence indeed!" Charlie forced a smile.

Sebastian asked, "You don't mind if I join you?"

Question marks practically floated above Charlie's head, but he said, "...Not at all."

Sebastian had already taken a seat, his gaze sweeping over Sophia. "What's the occasion for coming out today?"

Charlie gave a strained laugh. "Celebrating for Sophia…"

His eyes screamed silent questions: Where's Ethan? Where's the person you promised?

Sebastian raised an eyebrow, turning his attention to Sophia. "What are we celebrating?"

Sophia replied softly, "I just finished my exams."

Sebastian pondered. "Timing suggests... graduate entrance exams?"

Charlie thought to himself: He's putting on quite a show…

Sophia nodded.

"Which university are you aiming for?"

"MIT."

"What's your major?"

"Bioinformatics."

Sebastian said, "An interdisciplinary field based on biology, mathematics, and information science?"

Sophia looked up at him, curious. "You know about this?"

"I took an elective, but I'm no expert. I've always been curious about the differences between Applied Life Sciences, Bioinformatics, and Biology."

Sophia explained seriously. "Applied Life Sciences researches the practical applications of biological molecules. Biology studies the functions and properties of living organisms. Bioinformatics uses computers to study big data in biology. Is that clear enough?"

Sebastian thought for a moment. "So, could it be said that Biology is the theoretical foundation, Applied Life Sciences is the practical application, and Bioinformatics leans towards computer science, using math and statistics to solve biological problems?"

Sophia looked at him with newfound respect. "That's very accurate."

"Really?" Sebastian chuckled lightly. "You explained it well. I just summarized and phrased it in more common terms."

Sophia reassessed the man across from her.

In her memory, Sebastian was always seen at restaurants and bars, like a carefree playboy.

She never expected him to have an understanding of biology.

You really can't judge a book by its cover.

She had been with Ethan Roscente for six years, and he never really understood her field of study.

They never discussed these professional topics.

Their time together was spent either at bar gatherings or in the bedroom.

Hearing professional terminology from Sebastian was a genuine surprise.

Charlie, sitting beside them, looked completely lost. The unfamiliar terms gave him a headache.

He barely made it through the meal before rushing off to pay the bill.

Sebastian watched him leave, a slight smile playing on his lips, then turned to see the light in Sophia's eyes.

They continued their casual conversation. He glanced at his phone. "Charlie says something came up last minute. He asked me to see you home."

Sophia checked the time. It was getting late. "There's no need for trouble. I can take a cab."

"A gentleman doesn't let a lady go home alone. Besides, a promise is a promise."

Sophia pressed her lips together. "Well... thank you, then."

"The pleasure is mine."

They left the restaurant. Sebastian took his gloves and opened the car door for her. "After you."

He truly played the part of a gentleman.

"Thank you."

The twenty-minute drive was quiet.

Sebastian drove smoothly, with almost no sense of movement.

Sophia was captivated by the scenery outside the window: snow-laden branches, bare twigs, a cool, gentle breeze…

Sebastian turned the steering wheel, his peripheral glance taking in the woman beside him.

She was very pale, very quiet.

Sitting there, she exuded a scholarly air.

Her nose was straight and delicate, her lips cherry-red, her eyelashes like fans…

Gazing absently out the window, she unconsciously revealed a charming, innocent sweetness.

She used to have long, curly hair. Pretty, but unremarkable.

Now, her straight hair casually tucked under a scarf made her stunningly beautiful.

A flicker of amusement passed through Sebastian's eyes, gone in an instant.

He tightened his grip on the wheel, eyes forward, as if completely focused on the road.
###Chapter 42

The black sports car cruised down the Outer Harbor Road.

The night sky was illuminated by countless drones.

They arranged themselves into shifting patterns.

Sebastian Evans slowed the car.

He rolled down the window.

Cold air rushed into the cabin.

Sophia Sullivan followed his gaze.

The drones formed a brilliant Milky Way.

"Guess how many there are?" he asked.

Sophia shook her head. "Too many to count."

"Ninety-nine," he stated with certainty.

"Why?"

"For eternity."

As the words left his mouth.

The drones spelled out "Marry me".

Sophia was slightly stunned.

Sebastian pointed towards the viewing platform.

A man in a tailored suit was on one knee.

He held a bouquet of red roses.

"Impressive," she murmured softly.

In this moment, Sebastian.

Was completely different from the playboy she remembered.

Professional, sharp, perceptive.

During dinner, when Ninghai Tech's stock price was mentioned.

He had pinpointed the key issue with a few words.

His trading methods were extremely sophisticated.

Ethan Roscente's friends.

Were indeed all extraordinary characters.

That world was far too complicated.

She just wanted to extract herself in time.

"Just stop here," she pointed towards the alley entrance.

The headlights illuminated the narrow lane.

Sebastian didn't insist.

He watched her enter the building's entrance.

He waited until her figure disappeared.

Then he pressed the accelerator.

His phone screen lit up.

Charlie Lowell's caller ID flashed.

"Where did you guys go?" The background noise was chaotic.

Sebastian put on his Bluetooth headset.

"Sophia had something to do. I took her back first."

"What about Ethan? Weren't we supposed to run into him?"

"Couldn't reach him," his tone was flat.

Charlie muttered about it being a shame.

The call ended.

Sebastian pulled over to the side.

A crisp transfer notification sound rang out.

An unknown number sent a thank you text.

He called back.

A woman's voice answered with a laugh. "So generous, Mr. Evans."

"Keep your mouth shut."

"Don't worry~ But why did you need to keep Charlie occupied?"

Sebastian's eyes turned cold.

"Curiosity killed the cat."

The other end of the line fell silent instantly.

He pressed the end call button.

His fingertips tapped lightly on the steering wheel.

…

Sophia stepped out of the bathroom, drying her hair.

Research papers and materials covered the entire desk.

Her phone screen suddenly lit up.

Sebastian had sent a photo.

A pair of beige leather gloves lay on the passenger seat.

[You left these in my car]

She then remembered forgetting them when she got out.

[Please just mail them COD]

He replied quickly.

[Couriers aren't allowed in your complex]

[How about we set a time? I'm doing my MBA at MIT]

[I heard you're an alum. Would you mind showing me around?]

Sophia hesitated for a moment.

It was her oversight after all.

[Okay]

[Next Friday at eleven?]

She replied with an OK hand emoji.

…

The café was filled with a rich aroma.

Sebastian sat by the window.

Sunlight streamed through the glass, falling on his shoulders.

Sophia was five minutes late.

"Sorry, traffic was bad."

He pushed a brown paper bag towards her.

"Your gloves."

A record player flowed with jazz.

He had ordered an iced Americano.

She chose a hot latte.

"Come here often?" he asked.

Sophia shook her head. "Occasionally."

The river was covered with a thin layer of ice.

Willow branches were dusted with remnants of snow.

"Miles' tune," he said suddenly.

"Not many people know this one."

Sophia looked up. "You know a lot."

"Jack of all trades, master of none," he smiled.

Remembering Charlie's mention of his musician mother.

She fell silent at the appropriate time.

When their coffee cups were empty.

Sebastian stood up.

"Let's go."
###Chapter 43

Sophia Sullivan walked alongside Sebastian Evans, a paper bag in her hand, as they entered the MIT campus.

They strolled down the tree-lined path, chatting casually.

Sophia noticed Sebastian was remarkably knowledgeable, effortlessly engaging with any topic.

His tone was gentle, his manners impeccable. Being with him felt like a warm spring breeze.

As they passed a stone wall covered in ivy, Sophia turned her head and caught sight of a familiar figure.

Professor Alexander Laurent had just finished his class and was heading to the lab. He looked up and met Sophia's smiling eyes.

He paused briefly, his gaze sweeping over Sebastian beside her.

"What a coincidence. Just finished class?" Sophia initiated the conversation.

Alexander nodded. "Heading to the lab. And this is?"

"My friend, Sebastian Evans. I'm showing him around campus." She turned to Sebastian. "This is Professor Alexander Laurent."

Their eyes met. Sebastian's lips curved into a slight smile as he extended his hand. "I've heard so much about you, Professor Laurent."

Alexander shook his hand. "Likewise."

Both the Laurent and Evans families were prominent in their circles. They had heard of each other long before this meeting.

A subtle, unspoken tension hung in the air, unnoticed by Sophia, who only thought their handshake lasted a bit too long.

Alexander was the first to release his grip. "I should get to the lab."

Sophia watched him leave. Sebastian studied her thoughtfully. "You two are close?"

"Not really," she replied dismissively.

Sebastian didn't press further.

That evening, Sophia received a text from Sebastian.

[Thanks for showing me around campus today.]

She replied: [Anytime.]

She put her phone down and sank into her soft pillow.

The pillow still carried the faint scent of sunshine and clean laundry.

She fell asleep quickly.

Without intense studying, Sophia slept in until eight—a rare luxury.

The old neighborhood was full of life. Downstairs, she ran into neighbors returning from grocery shopping and walking their dogs.

Everyone greeted her warmly.

Sophia smiled and returned their greetings.

She turned into the adjacent old street. At the corner was a breakfast shop known for its rich soy milk and crispy fried dough sticks.

As soon as she entered, she spotted Alexander's back.

She crept up behind him and playfully tapped his shoulder, then quickly slid into the seat opposite.

Seeing his completely unfazed expression, Sophia raised an eyebrow. "Aren't you surprised at all?"

"Second time," Alexander said, dipping his fried dough stick into the soy milk. "You did the same thing last week. Besides, you're not much quicker than Erbai."

Sophia glanced at the large yellow dog tied up by the door. "..."

Before she could retort, the elderly woman wrapping wontons came over, smiling. "Here again, sweetie? The usual?"

Sophia nodded. "One fried dough stick, twelve wontons."

The old woman worked deftly, soon bringing over the wontons, the fried dough stick, and a side of pickles Sophia loved.

Sophia's eyes curved into smiles. "Thank you, Grandma."

"Eat it while it's hot," the old woman said warmly.

The wontons had thin wrappers and generous fillings, served in a milky-white bone broth with a sprinkle of green scallions. The aroma was irresistible.

Sophia looked at Alexander. He always ordered the same two things. It seemed so monotonous.

"Maybe try something different next time?"

Without waiting for his answer, she fetched a clean bowl, put two wontons in it, and pushed it toward him. "Want to try?"

Alexander hesitated for a moment, then picked one up and tasted it carefully.

Sophia blinked expectantly. "Well?"

Seeing her eager expression, he nodded. "Not bad."

Sophia raised her eyebrows triumphantly. "Of course it's good. I recommended it."

Alexander gave a light chuckle.

...

Charlie Lowell: "Hey, Sebastian. Birthday's coming up, right? How are we celebrating this year? Racing? Cabaret show? Or something wild—strippers everywhere?"

Julian Winston immediately chimed in: "Great idea."

They both looked at Sebastian.

When it came to partying, he was the expert.

Despite his polished, suit-and-tie appearance, he partied harder than anyone.

"Keeping it simple this year. Just a birthday party."

Charlie: "??"

Julian: "???"

Sebastian: "Problem?"

"That doesn't sound like you, man," Charlie said, looking him over. "You feeling okay?"

Julian raised an eyebrow. "A birthday party? Sounds like something my old man would throw."

Who even had birthday parties these days?

"Unless..." Charlie's eyes lit up. "It's that kind of party?"

Julian immediately sat up straight, eyes gleaming.

Sebastian: "Get your minds out of the gutter. It's a proper gathering. Private estate on Goldcrest Road. Invitations will be sent out in a few days."

With that, he stood up and left.

Charlie and Julian exchanged a look, then both turned to the window—

The sun wasn't rising in the west, was it?

...

Sophia was surprised to receive Sebastian's call.

Hearing his birthday party invitation made her even more astonished.

"Me?"

"Yes."

Sophia frowned.

Ethan Roscente would likely be at Sebastian's birthday party. She didn't want to see him.

"It's just a small gathering with friends. Charlie will be there too. Not going to grace us with your presence?" Sensing her hesitation, Sebastian pressed, "Or are you afraid of something?"

Sophia tightened her grip on her phone, silent.

"You and Ethan are over. He's serious with his new girlfriend now. Are you scared to come because you're not over him?"

Sophia frowned. "Of course not. We're completely done."

Sebastian's lips curved. "Then there's no need to avoid him. I'll text you the address. Remember to come."

He hung up before she could respond.

...

On the day of the party, the estate was elaborately decorated and buzzing with excitement.

Ethan arrived late with Isabella Langley.

Isabella handed her coat to a waiter and entered arm-in-arm with him.

Goldcrest Road was prime real estate. Sebastian had pulled strings to acquire this private estate.

It was designed by a renowned architect and carefully arranged by a feng shui master.

They passed through a courtyard with rockeries and entered the banquet hall.

Ethan offered his congratulations first.

"Happy birthday."

He tossed Sebastian a set of yacht keys, a gift tailored to his taste.

Sebastian caught them. "Thanks."

Ethan smiled and was about to say more when his gaze shifted and abruptly landed on a familiar figure.
###Chapter 44

Sebastian Evans's birthday party was grand.

Crystal chandeliers refracted dazzling light.

Amid the perfumed crowd and elegant attire, Isabella Langley held onto Ethan Roscente's arm, her smile sweet.

She was whispering something.

Ethan suddenly stiffened.

He jerked his hand back.

Isabella froze, looking up.

Sophia Sullivan stood not far away.

She wore a simple black dress, her face free of makeup, yet she was still striking.

Ethan frowned at Sebastian Evans. "You invited her?"

Sebastian swirled his wine glass, smiling casually. "We're all friends. Of course I did."

"Why didn't you tell me beforehand?"

"Forgot." Sebastian shrugged. "Is it that important?"

Sophia had already walked over.

She handed a gift box to Sebastian. "Happy birthday."

Sebastian took it, his fingertips brushing the back of her hand.

Sophia quickly withdrew her hand.

"A drink?" Sebastian picked up a glass from a waiter's tray. "Bottoms up."

He threw his head back and drained it.

Sophia had no choice but to pick up a glass as well.

The red wine went down her throat, and she frowned slightly.

"I have things to do. I should go."

Sebastian stopped her. "In such a hurry? At least stay for the cake."

Sophia checked the time and nodded in agreement.

The alcohol was slowly taking effect.

The warm air was making her dizzy.

She headed to the garden for some air.

Ethan watched her retreating back, his expression dark.

Isabella leaned against him softly. "Ethan, I don't feel well. Could you take me to the lounge?"

Her voice was sweet, but her eyes flickered toward the garden.

Ethan pulled his gaze back, his tone irritable. "Let's go."

Sophia walked along the garden path.

The cold air cleared her head considerably.

The Evans family garden was astonishingly luxurious.

Rare, expensive trees were everywhere.

She took a deep breath and prepared to go back.

Suddenly, someone embraced her from behind.

Hot breath fanned her neck.

It carried the scent of alcohol.

Sophia stiffened, thinking it was Ethan.

She was about to struggle when she heard a low chuckle.

She whirled around to meet Sebastian's amused eyes.

"Why is it you?" She stepped back in alarm.

Sebastian advanced a step. "Who did you think it was?"

"You're drunk."

"I'm perfectly sober." His gaze was intense. "I want to kiss you."

Sophia stood frozen.

Her mind went completely blank.

Sebastian curled his lips into a smile. "Scared?"

"You... Do you know what you're saying?"

"Of course." His tone was certain. "I like you."

Sophia was utterly bewildered.

"That's impossible..."

"Why is it impossible?" Sebastian took another step forward. "You've already broken up."

"Even so, you're his friend!"

"So what?" Sebastian chuckled lightly. "I can't pursue you?"

Sophia shook her head. "I don't like you."

"That's alright." He didn't seem surprised. "I can wait."

"Please don't do this."

Sebastian suddenly reached out to grab her.

Sophia hurriedly stepped back.

She bumped into a solid chest.

Ethan's face was livid as he threw a punch at Sebastian.

Sebastian staggered back, blood immediately gushing from his nose.

Ethan grabbed him by the collar and threw another punch.

"Sebastian Evans! Are you even human?!"

Sophia was shocked into stillness.

Ethan's eyes were bloodshot as he pointed at her and roared, "She's my woman! How dare you touch her!"
###Chapter 45

Ethan's gaze was dark and menacing.

He stared intently at Sophia.

And you! He suddenly turned to her.

Of all people, why him?

Are you happy now?

Sophia's chest heaved.

Anger and humiliation twisted inside her.

What had she done wrong?

Why did she have to endure this?

Sebastian touched the cut on his nose.

A cold smile touched his lips.

What were we doing? You saw it all, didn't you?

Ethan's face was expressionless.

So, you have no explanation?

Explain what?

Explain that I like Sophia?

That I want to pursue her?

Sophia's face instantly paled.

Fire burned in Ethan's eyes.

He swung his fist at Sebastian.

You bastard!

You like her?

You want to pursue her?!

How dare you?!

Sebastian turned his head.

He immediately moved to shield Sophia.

What?

Is that not allowed?

Ethan gritted his teeth.

Of course it's not!

What's your status?

An ex-boyfriend who's ancient history?

Ethan sneered.

It's only history if I say it is.

Who the hell do you think you are?

Sebastian's eyes darkened.

You were the one who broke up with her.

We were all there.

Have you forgotten so quickly?

Ethan nodded.

So this is your trap?

A flicker of guilt crossed Sebastian's face.

I'm sorry, but you let her go first…

That doesn't mean you can pursue her!

Sebastian, are you that desperate?

Even a rabbit doesn't eat the grass by its own burrow!

Ethan, calm down.

In this world, people break up and move on.

You and she are over.

Does that mean Sophia can never be with another man?

If it's not me, it will be someone else.

Images flashed through Ethan's mind.

Sophia being intimate with another man.

Having children.

Something inside him snapped.

His fist flew uncontrollably.

Sebastian dodged quickly.

But protecting Sophia, he took a few hits.

Ethan didn't fare well either.

Sebastian knew his weaknesses.

Soon, Ethan's lip was split.

His forehead was bleeding.

Isabella had composed herself.

She came downstairs looking for Ethan.

She told herself not to dwell on it.

Her mood had improved.

But after searching the main hall, she couldn't find him.

A server pointed towards the small garden.

She saw Ethan fighting.

The other person was Sebastian!

Isabella was shocked.

Seeing Ethan's injuries, she rushed forward.

Stop it!

Stop fighting!

This is dangerous!

She reached out to pull Ethan back.

But he shoved her away.

She fell to the ground, disheveled.

Charlie and Julian heard the commotion and ran out.

Holy shit! What's going on?

Are you two insane?!

Stop it now!

Ethan!

Sebastian—

Each of them pulled one man apart.

Charlie spoke.

Ethan, calm down, take it easy!

Julian frowned.

Sebastian, stop this madness!

Can't we talk this out?

Why resort to violence?

Ethan and Sebastian struggled simultaneously.

Let me go!

Get off!

Charlie and Julian held on tightly.

Julian's gaze swept over both of them.

Talk. What exactly happened?

Charlie tried to mediate.

Whatever it is, we can discuss it.

We're all brothers here. Don't ruin the friendship!

Julian looked at Ethan.

It's Sebastian's birthday today.

Whatever huge issue this is, put it aside for now.

Sebastian wiped the blood from his lip.

His eyes swept over Ethan.

Everything I said earlier was serious.

This decision was made after careful thought.

You have no right to interfere.

He turned and walked towards Sophia.

He took off his jacket and draped it over her shoulders.

Are you okay?

Were you scared?

Let me take you home first.

Charlie and Julian were stunned.

Sebastian and Sophia?

What's going on?!

Is this why Ethan lost his mind?

Sophia came back to her senses.

She stepped back, avoiding Sebastian's hand.

She took off the suit jacket and returned it to him.

No need, I'll go back by myself.

Your issues, don't drag me into them.

I'm not a toy for you to fight over.

She looked up, enunciating each word clearly.

Let's not contact each other anymore.

This was directed at Sebastian.

And also at Ethan.

Sophia…

Sebastian lowered his eyes.

I'm sorry, I didn't think things through today.

That's why it turned into this mess.

If I've caused you trouble, I'll make it up to you…

Sophia interrupted.

If you really want to make it up to me, then stay away from me.

She had calmed down.

This wasn't her fault.

Sebastian acted on impulse.

Ethan was furious out of shame.

And she was completely innocent?

She refused to carry their negative emotions.

She just wanted to end the trouble.

But Sebastian wouldn't let her have her way.

He went through great lengths to run into her.

Creating chances to be together.

Finally breaking through the barrier.

How could he allow her to withdraw?

Sophia, you can choose to refuse.

But pursuing you is my right.

Sophia was speechless.

Did he think the situation wasn't chaotic enough?

That the fire wasn't burning fiercely enough?

Ethan's face grew darker.

Sebastian, do you think I'm dead?!

Sebastian shrugged.

You've hit me. You've yelled at me.

Just accept reality.

Sophia turned around.

You two chat slowly. I'm leaving.

Sebastian chased after her.

He reached out and gripped her shoulder.
###Chapter 46

Sebastian Evans's wrist was seized abruptly.

His movement halted.

He looked up, his gaze turning icy. "You?"

Sophia Sullivan looked up, dazed. "Professor Laurent..."

Her voice held a faint tremor.

Alexander Laurent's eyes swept over her red-rimmed eyes. "Are you alright?"

She shook her head slightly.

Her fingernails dug into her palms.

"I'm heading that way," Alexander said calmly. "I'll give you a ride."

Sophia agreed softly.

He shielded her as they turned.

Her teetering heart finally settled into place.

Sebastian quickly caught up.

"Don't you think you're overstepping, Professor?"

He smirked coldly. "The conference is at the hotel next door. This is my private property."

Alexander paused.

Sophia stopped with him.

Sebastian's expression darkened. "I'll see my own guest home."

Alexander glanced up mildly. "That depends on whether the guest is willing."

Sophia spoke immediately. "I'm going with Professor Laurent."

Sebastian's face tightened. "Sophia..."

Alexander placed a hand on her shoulder. "Let's go."

They began to turn.

"Stop!" Ethan Roscente stepped forward abruptly.

Rage churned in his eyes. "Sophia Sullivan, you're leaving with him?"

"Going home."

"Which home?" He pointed at Alexander, his lips curling in scorn. "Found a new place that fast?"

"No wonder the breakup was so clean. You were already tangled up with him?"

"You even dare to touch someone close to me? You've got some nerve!"

Anger burned away his reason.

Ethan spat out words without thought. "Is my cast-off really that good? Worth fighting over?"

"Is she even worthy?"

Sophia trembled.

The words were like poisoned daggers, stabbing deep.

So this was the point where pain turned numb.

She looked at Ethan's twisted face, her teeth chattering with cold.

She felt plunged into an icy abyss.

Alexander frowned.

The woman's slender frame shook in the wind.

As if it might shatter at any moment.

"Six years..." Her voice choked. "I thought there was at least some sincerity."

"Now I know how worthless I am in your eyes."

A self-mocking smile touched her lips. "It was wrong from the start. One wrong step, then another..."

Her face was pale, her eyes red.

Tears fell silently.

Ethan's chest constricted violently.

He wanted to speak, but no sound came out.

Finally, his voice was hoarse. "Why?"

He turned his furious gaze to Sebastian. "You knew she was mine! Why did you do this?!"

Sebastian met his gaze coolly. "Wasn't it you who told me to pursue her? Why the act now?"

Ethan's face went pale.

Sophia staggered back.

Alexander steadied her.

"I'm taking her now."

Sebastian narrowed his eyes, blocking the path. "This place belongs to the Evans family. You don't just come and go as you please."

Ethan also stepped closer.

His gaze was fierce, like a wolf's.

Alexander looked up.

His gentle eyes suddenly turned sharp. "The symposium at The New Yorker Hotel was initiated by Chairman Laurent. He is present today."

"A call would bring him here in two minutes."

"If you don't want this brought before the Evans and Roscente elders, know when to stop."

The Laurent family's influence far surpassed that of the Evans and Roscente families.

Especially when it involved the elder generation.

Sebastian's expression shifted slightly.

Ethan also frowned.

"The cooperation between the Laurent and Roscente families continues," Alexander said calmly. "You cannot afford the responsibility of letting personal matters damage that relationship."

A lightly spoken warning.

Yet it silenced them both.

Alexander spoke mildly. "Step aside."

Ethan stood his ground, face dark.

Sebastian narrowed his eyes for a long moment, then finally stepped back.

Alexander led Sophia away.

"Damn it!" Ethan kicked a pebble away.

Rage seethed in his chest.

Charlie Lowell and Julian Winston exchanged a look, not daring to speak.

Isabella Langley approached cautiously. "Ethan..."

"Get lost!"

...

It started raining on the way back.

Raindrops tapped against the car window.

Drawing watery trails.

The wind howled relentlessly.

Sophia stared out the window, her heart hollow and cold.

Her body wouldn't stop shaking.

A warm coat was gently draped over her shoulders.

The clean, woody scent of cold incense enveloped her.

Her emotions broke.

Tears fell silently.

Alexander heard the soft weeping.

His chest felt tight.

He asked the driver to pull over.

Raised the partition.

Giving her space to release.

After a long time, Sophia gradually calmed.

Her fingers unconsciously clutched the coat. "Earlier... I'm sorry..."

Alexander looked at her seriously. "You don't need to care about those words."

"Don't take biased opinions to heart."

"You are good. I've always thought so."

"Don't punish yourself for others' mistakes."

His tone was gentle.

His gaze sincere.

Sophia slowly stopped crying.

She looked up.

Meeting his deep, thoughtful eyes.
###Chapter 47

Sophia Sullivan looked up at him. "Really?"

Alexander Laurent nodded. "Mm-hmm."

She took a deep breath. "Thank you. I feel a bit better."

A flicker of relief passed through Alexander's eyes as he saw her mood improve.

"Are you hungry? There's a good Sichuan place nearby."

Sophia hesitated for a moment, then nodded.

The restaurant was famous for its spicy hot pot.

Alexander couldn't handle extreme spice, so he ordered a split pot.

The red oil broth bubbled and boiled, steam rising with an aromatic scent.

Sophia's spirits were still low, but the surrounding noise chased away some of the gloom.

Tender beef, crisp vegetables—even someone with no appetite felt tempted.

Outside, the rain poured down. Inside, it was warm and cozy.

Amid the laughter and chatter around them, Sophia gradually calmed.

She looked up. The man across from her had barely touched his food. His elegant demeanor seemed less about dining and more about keeping her company.

She remembered another rainy night when he had silently stayed by her side. Gratitude washed over her.

"Thank you... for today." She hadn't expected to end up in such an awkward situation. If Alexander hadn't shown up, she might not have escaped.

"That kind of scene is literally my nightmare."

Even if she tried not to care, how could she truly remain unaffected?

She snapped out of her thoughts and met Alexander's calm gaze. A light laugh escaped her. "Good thing you came. Like... a savior."

"Savior isn't the right word for this," Alexander said with an amused smile.

Sophia looked into his eyes behind his glasses, his words echoing in her ears—

"You are far stronger than you think."

It wasn't just comfort. It was affirmation.

Sophia paused, then suddenly laughed. "Your glasses are fogged up. Can you even see?"

The lenses were covered in a thick layer of condensation, looking rather endearing.

Alexander took off his glasses with a resigned sigh and wiped them with a tissue. "This is why I don't come to hot pot places often."

Sophia raised an eyebrow with a light smile. "So you don't like hot pot."

"It's not that I dislike it. It's just inconvenient."

He cleaned the lenses and put his glasses back on.

Sophia nodded, recalling that he never seemed picky during meals at home.

Alexander picked up some beef. "This is good. Try it..."

"Thank you, I can serve myself..."

Alexander had to return to the lab and only walked her to her building.

The rain had stopped. The ground was wet and chilly. Sophia shivered, instinctively pulling her coat tighter. She caught the familiar scent of sandalwood.

She looked down at the dark overcoat she was wearing and smiled.

She remembered Alexander was only wearing a thin sweater. He should be... fine, right?

The next day, hearing his constant sneezing, Sophia concluded: men aren't that much more resistant to the cold.

"The coat is at the dry cleaner. I'll get it back in a few days."

Alexander waved a hand. "No rush."

It was just a coat. He had plenty.

"I came back to get some clothes. Heading right back to the lab."

His voice was thick, and he wore a mask. His cold was clearly bad.

"Wait."

Sophia turned and went inside, returning with a thermos.

"Ginger tea I made yesterday. Drink it while it's hot."

At the mention of ginger, Alexander's brow furrowed almost imperceptibly. Sophia didn't notice and handed him a bag. "There's also cold medicine. The instructions are on the box."

Alexander rarely got sick. He paused, almost wanting to hand the thermos back.

But Sophia added, "After all, you caught this cold because of me."

He withdrew his hand.

He checked the time. He was almost late.

"Thank you. I'll drink it."

Watching his hurried departure, Sophia closed the door and went back inside.

Her thesis needed more work. She had been researching for days.

The original German books and papers Professor Watson gave her were full of technical terms that required careful translation.

Sophia was deeply immersed in her writing when her phone rang.

Interrupted, she frowned and answered.

"Hello?"

"I'm sorry about yesterday, but we need to talk in person."

It was Sebastian Evans.

Sophia was silent for a moment. She wanted closure too.

They agreed on a time and place. She hung up.

Ethan Roscente's angry face flashed in her mind. She shook her head, dismissing the thought, and returned to her thesis.

...

They met at the same café as before.

It wasn't far from MIT.

She pushed the door open. Sebastian was in his usual spot.

His back was to the door, but he seemed to sense her arrival, turning when the bell chimed.

His overcoat was draped nearby. Sebastian wore a Gucci dress shirt, the top buttons undone, revealing his throat and collarbone.

It drew stolen glances from girls at nearby tables.

Ignoring the looks, Sophia sat down. Sebastian asked what she wanted to drink.

She got straight to the point. "I'm here to make things clear."

Sebastian understood her meaning but wasn't annoyed. Instead, he smiled. "I meant every word I said."

Sophia frowned. "Then you should know I don't like you. There's no future for us."

Sebastian shrugged. "I've long understood there are no undefeated generals in this world. But a good outcome is what matters, right?"

He had always been persistent. Once he set a goal, he never gave up.

He was also patient. He could wait for Sophia to soften.

Just like how Ethan Roscente had persisted back then.

Didn't he succeed in the end?

If Ethan could do it, why couldn't he?
###Chapter 48

Sophia frowned at him.

She was about to speak.

A surprised voice suddenly cut in. "Sophia?!"

Charlie Lowell had just finished a dinner engagement.

He spotted the two figures through the café's floor-to-ceiling window while passing by.

Sebastian Evans and Sophia Sullivan?

He thought his eyes were deceiving him.

He rubbed his eyes.

He confirmed it was them.

A complex expression crossed Charlie's face as he pushed the door open.

His gaze shifted between the two of them.

Sophia abandoned her intention to continue the conversation.

She forced a faint smile. "What a coincidence."

She picked up her bag and stood. "I should get going."

Charlie slid into the seat she had just vacated.

He looked across at Sebastian. "Are you actually serious about this?"

Sebastian took a slow, deliberate sip of his coffee.

"Serious about what?"

"Sophia would never accept you." Charlie shook his head.

Sebastian paused. "Why not?"

"First, you're not her type. Second, there's your history with Ethan."

Sebastian let out a soft, derisive sound.

Charlie leaned closer, lowering his voice. "When did you start having designs on Sophia?"

Sebastian looked out the window.

"A long time ago," he said evenly. "Roughly around the time she first got together with Ethan."

"You animal!" Charlie gritted his teeth. "Coveting your friend's woman!"

"What did I do while they were together?" Sebastian retorted coldly. "They're broken up now. Am I not allowed to have feelings?"

"Just having those feelings back then was wrong!"

"Weren't you and Julian Winston both into the same girl in high school?"

Charlie was stung. "That was... immature... You can't control who you like..."

"And I can control it?"

Ethan Roscente didn't know how to cherish her.

Naturally, someone else would.

He hadn't stolen her away.

He waited until now to make a move.

That was already showing considerable regard for their past friendship.

Charlie ran a hand through his hair in frustration. "Just give up. Forced fruit isn't sweet."

Ethan had already turned against Sebastian.

He declared their friendship over.

He demanded that Sebastian be excluded from any gathering he attended.

Their circle didn't dare comment much.

Rumors about the reason for their fallout varied.

Some said a business collaboration failed due to uneven profit distribution.

Others guessed there was tension between their families.

There was even a rumor about them fighting over an escort.

This last rumor was the most widespread.

Charlie brushed it off outwardly.

But inwardly, he blamed Sebastian for being dishonorable.

Sebastian shrugged indifferently. "Save your breath. You don't know if it's sweet until you taste it."

...

Sophia left the café.

She went to the mall and bought a new scarf and a cashmere coat.

Then she went grocery shopping.

By the time she emerged, the sky was dark.

Winter nights came early.

She quickened her pace home.

It was completely dark by the time she reached her apartment building.

A figure suddenly rushed out from the shadows of a nearby alley.

She thought it was a homeless person.

A chill ran down her spine, her hair standing on end.

She only relaxed when she recognized Ethan Roscente.

But he reeked of alcohol and was swaying unsteadily.

Her frown returned.

Ethan had been waiting a long time.

The cold had turned the tip of his nose red.

Emboldened by drink, he grabbed her wrist.

"Mimi..."

"Let go." Sophia tried to pull away.

She didn't know when it started.

But she could no longer stand his touch.

"I won't! Not unless you come back!"

Sophia didn't know what had gotten into him.

"You're drunk."

"Mimi... I'm serious..."

He was the second man today to say he was serious.

Ethan continued, "Before, you asked if I came back to be the other man? I've broken up with Isabella Langley now. I can pretend what happened with Sebastian never happened."

"I spoke out of turn yesterday. I apologize. You can hit me, yell at me, whatever you want."

The night was deep, and few people were around.

The weather forecast said today was the coldest day of the winter so far.

A chill seeped into Sophia's back, and the air she breathed felt icy.

"I'm sorry." Her lashes fluttered slightly as she looked down. "We can't go back."

This stubborn, proud man was finally yielding.

But she no longer cared.

"Your stomach is weak. You should drink less."

She pulled her hand free and turned to leave.

Drink less...

She still cared about him!

Ethan's eyes lit up with hope. He chased after her and grabbed her arm.

He pulled her tightly into his embrace.

"Mimi, you still care about me, don't you? Can we start over?"

He urgently tried to kiss her.

Sophia's eyes widened. She pushed him away.

She wiped her mouth with disgust. "Don't touch me!"

Ethan froze completely.

Her disdainful gesture, her disgusted look —they were like sharp knives, stabbing him until he bled.

The alcohol-induced warmth vanished instantly, leaving only a cold sober.

Sophia spoke calmly. "The truth is, I knew all along. During all those years we were together, you slept with more than one other woman. You thought you hid it well. But a woman in love is a detective. Did you really think I couldn't see all those traces you failed to clean up?"

The first time she noticed something was wrong was when he returned from a business trip.

She found a corner of a condom wrapper while unpacking his suitcase.

It was smaller than a fingernail.

But she recognized instantly it wasn't the brand they used.
###Chapter 49
That night, she claimed she wasn't feeling well and slept alone in the guest room.

She was afraid that if she stayed one more second, she would vomit.

The night was deep and dark.

A biting cold wind cut through the air.

Tears soaked her pillow.

The next day, she went to Massachusetts General Hospital for a full gynecological exam.

Fortunately, everything was normal.

From that day on, she deliberately avoided Ethan Roscente's touch.

And he didn't even notice.

Then again, why would he notice the home fires had gone cold when he was well-fed elsewhere?

"You disgust me," Sophia Sullivan said. "Stay away from me."

Ethan's breath hitched. His throat tightened. He couldn't look her in the eye.

So she knew...

A light drizzle began to fall again.

The wind wailed, cold and piercing.

Ethan stood in the rain, letting it soak him completely. He stared like a stone statue at Sophia's retreating back.

Isabella Langley rushed into the downpour. Seeing his pale lips and chilled body, she cried out, "Ethan, don't do this to yourself! You'll get sick!"

She was also soaked and shivering. "You're standing out here, but does Sophia even care? I'm the one who loves you! I don't want to break up. Please, let me stay!"

Ethan ignored her, his eyes red as he pushed her away. "Get lost!"

"If you won't leave, then I'll stay with you!" Isabella gritted her teeth, determined.

Ethan didn't care what she said or did.

He stubbornly stared in that direction, hoping she would look back.

But she left without a single glance.

Drunkenness and cold overwhelmed him. Ethan finally collapsed in the rain.

Isabella panicked. "Ethan! Ethan! Don't scare me..."

She rushed to the roadside and hailed a cab. The female driver helped her carry Ethan into the car.

Back at the Beverly Hills mansion, her first priority was changing him into dry clothes and drying his hair. She ignored her own soaked state.

The family doctor arrived to administer an IV. His complexion didn't improve until midnight.

Exhausted, Isabella drifted in and out of sleep. She heard the man's muddled dreams. Leaning closer, she made out the name "Sophia."

Remembering his cold proposal to break up that day, her worst fear had come true.

But she refused to accept it. She had worked so hard to get close to him, to finally push his ex away. How could she let go now?

Isabella looked at the sleeping man in the bed, her eyes growing dark.

She made a decision.

She took off her clothes. She rummaged through the closet and put on the nightgown Sophia had left behind.

Then she carefully lay on top of Ethan.

Ethan felt a soft touch. He smelled a familiar scent. He forced his eyes open.

In his blurry vision, he saw Sophia!

She had come back!

Wearing that sexy nightgown. Her breath was warm. She was enchanting.

This time, he wouldn't let her go.

He flipped over, pinning her beneath him. He kissed her urgently. "Sophia... Sophia..."

You've finally forgiven me.

...

A night of passion lasted until the early hours.

The man, satisfied, fell into a deep sleep.

Ethan woke the next morning, rubbing his throbbing temples.

His elbow brushed against a warm body. He froze.

He turned his head and saw Isabella lying beside him.

They were both naked, under the same blanket.

Red marks dotted the girl's neck. Her cheeks were flushed. Clearly, she had been thoroughly loved.

Ethan shook his head. The erotic memories of last night slowly came into focus.

He smacked his forehead in frustration. How could he have been so foolish?

Isabella had been awake for a while. She felt him stir and slowly opened her eyes, feigning a sleepy, innocent look. She seemed startled, then blushed.

She shyly pressed her lips together and hugged Ethan from behind. "Baby, you hurt me last night. I kept saying no, but you wouldn't stop..."

Ethan frowned. "What happened last night?"

He only remembered watching Sophia walk away without looking back from her building...

How he got home, how he ended up in bed with Isabella—he couldn't remember any of it.

Isabella saw his dark expression. Her eyes darted away. Two seconds later, tears fell. "You passed out in the rain yesterday. I got a cab and brought you home to take care of you. I was going to leave, but you held me and wouldn't let me go. You pinned me to the bed... I kept crying that it hurt, but you ignored me. And then... this happened."

She bit her lip and looked up, her eyelashes fluttering pitifully. "Last night was my first time. You're my first love. My first man. I just like you. I went to find you because I wanted to stay by your side."

"If you really want to break up, I'll leave now..."

She threw off the covers, picked up her clothes, and began dressing while crying.

Ethan's headache worsened.

As the girl bowed her head, the love bites on her neck silently accused him.

Isabella's hands trembled so much she couldn't fasten her bra. After several failed attempts, she shivered like a drenched kitten.

Forget it.

Ethan's heart softened in the end. "Let's not talk about breaking up for now. We'll leave things as they are."

"Get dressed. I'll take a shower and then drive you back to school."

The bathroom door closed. Isabella immediately dropped the pitiful act. A smug smile played on her lips.

That nightgown of Sophia's had already been quietly returned to the closet.

She hadn't expected "the other woman's clothes" to work so well.

If you're going to play, play for keeps.
###Chapter 50

Ethan closed his laptop.

His phone screen lit up.

Charlie's name flashed.

"Ethan, wanna grab a drink at the usual spot?"

"Sure."

He picked up his jacket.

He was halfway down the stairs.

A noise came from the foyer.

Isabella was bending over to change her shoes.

Their eyes met.

They both froze.

Ethan frowned. "What are you doing here?"

Isabella gripped her backpack strap. "Are you going out?"

"Yeah."

She bit her lip until it turned white. "Did I... disturb you?"

The man didn't answer.

"I just got out of class... I didn't skip... Last night you were too rough... I'm a little inflamed... It hurts..."

Her voice grew softer.

Her face grew redder.

"There are some ointments in the first aid kit... I wanted to use one..."

She stared down at her toes.

Her fingers twisted together.

"I'll leave right now!"

She turned to pull the door open—

"Come back."

Her eyes lit up instantly.

Then she quickly lowered her lashes. "Ba—"

Ethan pulled out the first aid kit.

He read the instructions carefully.

"These won't work."

Isabella's eyes welled up. "Then what... The people at the pharmacy will laugh at me..."

He rubbed his temples.

He grabbed his car keys.

"To the hospital."

"Will it delay your plans..."

"Charlie can wait."

"Then... after the doctor, can I go with you?"

"Suit yourself."

...

The hospital hallway lights were harsh.

Isabella's ears were bright red.

Ethan handed her the medicine bag. "Sorry."

"I like being with you," she said, lifting her face. "Any way is fine."

Her eyes were startlingly bright.

So pure it made him feel guilty.

Ethan looked away.

Misplaced guilt gnawed at his heart.

Breaking up now would be too cruel.

"Get in the car."

"Where are we going?"

"Didn't you want to come along?"

"Oh." She obediently fastened her seatbelt.

...

The music in the private room was deafening.

Charlie swayed his hips, holding a glass. "Feel the rhythm—hey!"

Julian kicked him. "Get away from me."

"No appreciation for art!" Charlie pouted. "Is Sebastian here?"

"What do you think?"

Everyone knew those two were at each other's throats now.

"I asked earlier. That's why I invited Ethan—"

The door suddenly swung open.

Charlie's smile froze on his face.
###Chapter 51

Ethan was standing there with Isabella.

"Ethan... sit!"
He hurriedly poured a drink.

While Isabella was in the restroom.
Charlie leaned in. "Dude, I thought you broke up?"

Ethan downed his whiskey.
"She's young."

Charlie winced.
A college student is young?

"What about Sophia..."

"I'll handle it."

"So you're two-timing?"

"Just keeping Isabella calm for now."

Charlie swallowed his words.
This was heading for disaster.

...

The party broke up in the early hours.
Charlie drunkenly signed the tab.
Julian headed straight for the hotel.

Only the two of them were left on the curb.
Isabella snuggled closer.
"Should we go to the mansion tonight?"

The implication was clear.

Ethan was silent for a moment.
"You have class tomorrow. Go back to the dorm."

Her smile faded.
She still nodded obediently. "Okay."

The gates of Caltech slowly closed.
Ethan withdrew his gaze.

The driver waited for instructions.
But he suddenly pushed the car door open.
"Drive it back yourself."

The night breeze was cool.
His feet moved on their own.
Stopping before a familiar school gate.

A place he once waited day and night.
Just to catch one more glimpse of her.

The alley was narrow and dark.
Beer bottles clattered.
The sour smell of garbage filled the air.

He knocked on the metal door.
The sound echoed in the night.

"Sophia, open the door."
I know you're in there.
Open the door.
We need to talk.

Sophia Sullivan!
Do you hear me?

Fine.
Sophia Sullivan.
You're something else.
Won't open the door?
You think I can't get in?

Ethan Roscente's voice shifted from pleading to calm.
Then it finally erupted in full-blown rage.

His patience snapped.
He turned to leave.

He abruptly met a pair of cold, sharp eyes.

Ethan froze.
He frowned deeply.

The narrow stairwell was dimly lit.
Alexander Laurent stood on the steps.
He had just reached this floor.

His appearance here, at this hour, spoke volumes.

After Sebastian Evans's recent drama.
Now Alexander Laurent shows up.
Amid his irritation, Ethan finally realized the men around Sophia weren't simple.

He had calmed down and immediately looked into Alexander's background.

Turns out he's the third son of the Laurent family.
No wonder Sebastian backed off.

Ethan: Here for Sophia?

Alexander spoke coolly: What if I am?
What if I'm not?

You should know what my relationship with her is.

So?

Ethan narrowed his eyes: If you know what's good for you, you'll stay away from her.

Sorry.
I'm famously bad at knowing what's good for me.

Sophia is mine!
She always was.
She's just throwing a tantrum now.
In the future, she'll still only be mine.

Alexander frowned: She's a person.
Not an object.
She doesn't belong to anyone.
If you must say she belongs to someone.
Then she only belongs to herself.

Ethan sneered: Professor Laurent, you've read a lot of books.
But you don't understand women.
The deepest love breeds the fiercest hate.
The reason Sophia is causing such a scene with me.
Is because she loves me too much.

If you don't believe me, knock.
She won't open it for you either.
Stop coveting things that aren't yours.
It's a waste of energy.

Finished speaking.
Ethan pushed past him and strode down the stairs.

Alexander watched him leave.
His gaze swept over Sophia's door.
He frowned in confusion.

Of course he knew Sophia wouldn't open the door.
To be precise.
She wouldn't open it for anyone.

Because—
She simply wasn't home.

...

Maldives.
Blue skies, white clouds.
The sound of waves.

The turquoise water was crystal clear.
Fish were visible, swimming about.

The sun was warm.
The breeze gentle.
Waves lapped.

Three days ago.
Sophia got a call from Olivia Lopez.

Her project was finished and delivered.
Her boytoy had gone back to his hometown for winter break.
She had slept for two straight days at home.
Bored out of her mind.
She proposed an impromptu trip to Sophia.

As for the destination…
Olivia rested her chin on her hand: Let's do the Maldives.

Sophia thought for two seconds: Okay.

Partly to avoid the mess with Sebastian and Ethan.
Partly to relax.

Sophia loved reading and delving into research.
But she also knew being wound too tight wasn't good.
A balance of work and rest was necessary for the long haul.

Right now.
The azure sea stretched under a cloudless sky.
She lay on a beach chair, listening to waves crash against the rocks.
She enjoyed the warm sun.
Feeling more and more that this trip was the right decision.

She picked up her mango juice and took a sip.
Not too sweet, not too bland. Just right.

Not far away.
Olivia, dressed in something sexy, walked across the sand.
Seeing Sophia's lazy look, she simply lay down on the adjacent chair: So comfortable~ You really know how to enjoy yourself.

She put on her sunglasses.
Took a sip of coconut water, imitating Sophia's pose.
A content smile touched her lips.

Sophia crossed her long legs and turned over leisurely: Weren't you off on a date?

Olivia made a disgusted face: That blond guy was all muscle.
Thought he'd be impressive.
Turned out to be all show.
Not as good as my boytoy.

Sophia smiled: The last one… Kevin?

Switched him out ages ago.
This puppy is the sunny type.
Cute looks, cute personality.
Smells amazing all over.
And the key point? He can cook!
Unbelievably good!

What about you?
Olivia looked at her through her sunglasses, teasing: Not planning to find someone new?

Hanging yourself on one tree is so boring?
Dating different people is what's fun!

Sophia looked out at the vast sea: Not considering it.
No time, no energy, no need.

True.
Olivia clicked her tongue: Men just mess with a top student's problem-solving efficiency and drag down exam scores.

She stretched, her gaze drifting: Saw a blue-eyed hottie earlier.
I'm going to catch up with him for a chat.
You entertain yourself for now.
Bye~

Sophia raised her glass in a toast: Have fun.

...

Did you find out?
Ethan stood by his office's floor-to-ceiling window.
His sharp gaze landed on his assistant.
This time it's not wrong again, is it?

The assistant was apprehensive: Sorry, Mr. Roscente.
Last time… I was careless.
It's clear now.
Miss Sullivan didn't fly to Harbin.
She went to the Maldives.

Sure?

Here's the flight boarding information.
Miss Sullivan's name is on the passenger manifest.

Ethan didn't look closely.
He believed it wouldn't be wrong this time.

The last mistake wasn't entirely the assistant's fault.
Who could have guessed Sebastian would be so underhanded.
He actually swapped Sophia's information with another passenger's.
Intentionally misleading the investigation.
Giving false information.

Ethan: Book me the earliest flight.

The assistant took out his phone to check: Mr. Roscente.
The earliest flight is tomorrow morning at seven.

Then that one.

Okay.
If there's nothing else.
Shall I step out?

Ethan waved his hand.

The assistant turned to leave.
Remembering to close the door respectfully.

Assistant Lin.
Why are you sweating so much?
Did Mr. Roscente yell at you?

Lin Ming waved his hand: Don't even ask.
By the way.
Help Mr. Roscente book a ticket for the seven AM flight to the Maldives tomorrow.
I'm out of time.
I have to go.

Okay.
Don't worry, go to Emma's parent-teacher conference.
I've got this here!

Lin Ming chuckled: You've only been here a few days?
Don't boast, it's easy to get slapped in the face.

Relax.
How could I mess up booking a ticket?
You're really underestimating me.

Alright.
Get it done quickly.
Won't chat anymore.
If I'm really late.
Emma will nag me for a month...

The female assistant immediately took out her work phone and started booking the ticket.

Her phone happened to have saved traveler information.
At checkout, it showed two tickets were about to be booked.

Her first instinct was to call Lin Ming and clarify.
Was it just for Mr. Roscente alone?
Or should she book two tickets, including the other saved traveler, Isabella Langley.

But the phone only rang twice before the call was dropped on the other end.

The female assistant didn't dare ask Ethan directly.
Coupled with Lin Ming's earlier implication that this ticket was needed urgently.
After much internal debate, she booked two tickets.

Her reasoning was sound—

Mr. Roscente going to the Maldives couldn't be for business, right?

Since it's a vacation, he must be taking his girlfriend.

Right.
Two tickets shouldn't be wrong!
###Chapter 52

Ethan Roscente sat in the airport VIP lounge.

His fingers glided over his phone screen.

Thirty minutes until boarding.

His brow furrowed slightly.

Flight information flickered on the display.

Suddenly, his movements stilled.

Sebastian Evans had updated his social media with a new photo.

Azure sea, clear blue sky, a setting sun.

The caption read—

["The weather in the Maldives is perfect. Most importantly, I got to meet the person I wanted to see."]

The comments section was already exploding.

User A commented: ["Seb, off on a holiday to hunt?"]

Sebastian Evans replied: ["Hunting is casting a wide net. I prefer precision fishing."]

User B chimed in: ["Sounds like someone's got a target, Mr. Evans?"]

Sebastian Evans responded with a grinning emoji.

...

Ethan's expression darkened.

Teasing remarks from mutual friends kept flooding the feed.

His fingertips pressed into the phone, turning white.

The boarding announcement echoed through the lounge.

He put his phone away and picked up his jacket.

Just as he pushed open the lounge door, a figure flung herself into his arms.

Isabella Langley looked up at him, her eyes sparkling with delight.

"Baby, you're the best."

She waved her boarding pass.

"I just mentioned once that I'd never been to the Maldives. You actually remembered."

Ethan's body went rigid.

Isabella continued excitedly, "The overwater bungalows open right onto the sea. Falling asleep to the sound of waves, waking up to watch the sunrise…"

He cut her off. "I need to use the restroom."

He turned and walked toward a corner.

The moment the call connected, his voice was icy.

"Liam Evans. Just say it if you want to be fired."

His assistant panicked. "Mr. Roscente, what do you mean?"

"I only booked one ticket."

Liam immediately apologized. "I'm sorry, it was an oversight."

Ethan ended the call.

Isabella waited by the door, rushing to meet him as he emerged.

"It's almost time to board."

Ethan's face was impassive. "Let's go."

The mistake was made. He had to roll with it.

Isabella skipped happily behind him.

She had applied meticulous makeup.

Her suitcase was stuffed with sexy swimwear.

He hadn't touched her since that one accidental night.

This trip might be a chance to change that…

The plane landed. A seaplane transferred them to the resort island.

Isabella held up her phone, constantly filming.

Suddenly she realized they had never taken a picture together.

She discreetly turned the camera toward Ethan.

The man was yawning, looking tired.

Noticing the lens, his face fell. He raised a hand to block it.

"Baby, let's take a photo together?"

"I don't like having my picture taken."

He closed his eyes, ignoring her.

Isabella bit her lower lip. The light in her eyes dimmed.

Hotel staff greeted them warmly.

Ethan walked toward the elevators, then stopped dead.

Sebastian Evans stepped out of an elevator.

A floral shirt and board shorts, worn with an air of effortless style.

Their eyes met.

Sebastian raised an eyebrow and approached, sunglasses hooked on his finger.

"Hi. Here for vacation?"

Ethan's expression was blank. "What a coincidence."

"Fate?" Sebastian chuckled lightly. "Though I arrived a day earlier."

Ethan's gaze turned frosty. "The false intel bought me some time. But you being early doesn't seem to have helped your cause?"

Sebastian's smile tightened slightly.

"No amount of scheming will work." Ethan's tone was definitive. "As long as I'm here, you two will never happen."

Sebastian glanced at Isabella, his meaning clear. "You never know until you try. People change."

He reached out to clap Ethan's shoulder, but Ethan moved away.

"Enjoy your vacation." Sebastian wasn't offended.

Ethan smirked coldly. "Some people probably won't enjoy it much."

He turned and entered the elevator.

Isabella hurried after him, her fingers tightening nervously.

The elevator doors opened.

Ethan withdrew his arm from her grasp. "Entertain yourself."

He walked away without looking back.

...

Sophia Sullivan examined the fox mask in her hands.

Intricate carvings, complex craftsmanship.

The eyes were strikingly lifelike.

"Where did this come from?" She looked at Olivia Lopez.

The mask fit perfectly, covering the upper half of her face.

It complemented her jawline flawlessly.

"The hotel is hosting a masquerade ball tonight." Olivia smiled. "I picked this little fox especially for you."

Sophia wore a red and white maxi dress today.

A pearl hair clip tucked behind her ear, a red pendant dangling near her temple.

It harmonized beautifully with the mask.
###Chapter 53

"A Masquerade Ball?"

"Exactly. The hotel hosts one every six months, each with a different theme."
"Last time was a costume party. The time before that was a Halloween horror party."
"This time it's a masquerade theme. Everyone loves it."

Christmas was approaching.
The hotel was decorated with festive lights and Christmas trees, brimming with holiday cheer.

Olivia Lopez excitedly shook the mask in her hand.
"I saw the staff wearing masks when I came in. Tonight is going to be so much fun!"

She had chosen a Fox Mask for Sophia Sullivan.
For herself, she picked the Lion Mask—the king of the jungle, utterly majestic!

Sophia chuckled softly.
"Why didn't you pick the tiger?"

"Why a tiger?"

"Isn't a tigress even more formidable?"

Olivia glared.
"...Are you asking for a fight?!"

Sophia grabbed her mask and ran, putting it on as she went.
"Hurry up, we're going to be late!"

"Stop right there! Who are you calling a tigress?! You are!"
...

The 23rd-floor ballroom.

The elevator doors opened.
Sophia instantly felt numerous gazes turn her way.

She never liked crowded places.
But wearing a mask made her feel considerably more at ease.

Olivia pulled her through the crowd to the bar.

"One Martini. What'll you have, Mimi?"

Sophia said, "Lemon water."

Olivia was speechless.
"Could you try to have a little more fun?"

"I want lem—"

Olivia cut her off directly.
"Get her a Bloody Mary!"

The bartender smiled and nodded.
"Certainly."

Sophia: "..." She couldn't smile.

Unbeknownst to her, a gaze from the shadows was intently following her figure...

Ethan Roscente leaned against the wall near the ballroom entrance, checking his watch intermittently.

He wore a Luciano Pavarotti Mask.
Its cracked black and gold design, adorned with musical notes, accentuated his cold, noble demeanor.

The collar of his white shirt was slightly open.
The hint of his collarbone added an air of restrained allure, drawing frequent sidelong glances from passersby.

After waiting five minutes, Ethan was already impatient.
Just as he was about to leave, Isabella Langley tapped his shoulder from behind.
"Baby, I'm here!"

The girl wore a Rabbit Mask.
Its fluffy ears paired with rabbit-eye makeup gave her a pure, adorable look.

"I got lost. I'm only two minutes late, don't be mad."

She took his hand and gave it a gentle shake.
"I heard there's a raffle tonight. With my luck, I'm sure to win the big prize."

Most of Ethan's displeasure vanished the moment he saw her.

"Let's go. Didn't you want to try the raffle?"
...

Elsewhere, Olivia had just set down her glass when a guy who perfectly matched her taste walked by.

Before she could even speak, Sophia said proactively, "Go on. Be careful."

Olivia blew her a kiss.
"Okay, I'm off then."

Sophia shook her head helplessly and looked around.
Most guests were dressed up, fully embracing the ball's atmosphere.

Exotic music began to play.
People paired off and stepped onto the dance floor.

Sophia took some snacks and found a quiet corner to sit.
She ate while reading a paper on her iPad.

Suddenly, a hand with distinct knuckles appeared before her.
A deep male voice followed.
"May I have this dance, beautiful lady?"

The man wore a black suit with striking sapphire blue cufflinks.
A vintage Patek Philippe graced his wrist, complementing his Phantom of the Opera Mask perfectly.

Sophia met his smiling eyes and instantly recognized him.

Sebastian! Evans!

"Sorry, I don't dance."

Sebastian stated confidently, "I've seen you practice in the school auditorium."

Sophia froze.

He was referring to the solo for the senior year graduation gala.
She had practiced for two months but couldn't perform due to a calf injury.

Even she had almost forgotten.
Yet he remembered.

Just then, the host's voice rang out.
A spotlight swept across the crowd.

Screams erupted throughout the venue.

The beam suddenly stopped, fixed on the two of them.
It enveloped them in a halo of light.

Sebastian's lips curved into a slight smile.
"Ball rules. The man and woman chosen by the spotlight must share a dance."
"Even heaven can't bear to see me rejected. Would you disappoint everyone?"

He bowed gracefully, extending his hand in invitation.

Cheers rose around them.
"Say yes—say yes—"

"Dance—dance—"

Gritting her teeth, Sophia could only place her hand in his palm.

Sebastian immediately guided her onto the dance floor.

Advancing, retreating, spinning, embracing, parting.
The tall Phantom had finally caught the elusive little fox.

His suit trousers and her skirt swirled together.
When their eyes met, Sebastian's were full of amusement.

Not only could Sophia dance, but she danced very well.

She had her mother to thank for that.
Her mother had her learn dance, painting, music, and etiquette from a young age.
She raised Sophia to be cultured, reasonable, and multi-talented.

Unexpectedly, Sophia showed greater aptitude for academics.
She competed in every subject, from preliminary rounds to provincial, then national competitions.
Finally, she stood on the podium at the International Science Olympiad.

That year, Sophia astonished the entire school, even the whole country.

Countless prestigious universities offered her places.
Yet she insisted on taking the college entrance exams.
She eventually entered MIT as the top science student.

"What are you thinking about?" Sebastian's voice sounded by her ear.

Sophia returned to the present.
"Just some memories from the past."

"College days?" His eyes darkened slightly. That period contained someone he'd rather not mention.

"No." Sophia shook her head.

The man chuckled low, his chest vibrating.
He led her into a spin, making her skirt flare.

Gasps of admiration sounded around them.

Though he led the dance, his movements remained restrained and gentlemanly.
He carefully protected her.

The hand at her waist was polite and proper, never overstepping.

"You look beautiful today. The fox mask suits you," he said, his voice laced with a smile.

Sophia raised an eyebrow.
"What a coincidence. You're here on vacation too?"
###Chapter 54
The lights were dim and hazy.

During the partner swap, Sophia Sullivan clearly saw the stunned expression on Isabella Langley's face.

The next second, her wrist was gripped tightly.

Ethan Roscente's palm was warm, his other arm possessively encircling her waist.

He shot Sebastian Evans a challenging glance before looking down at her, his gaze softening.

"Sophia, are you still angry?"

Sophia lowered her eyes, offering no response.

"I went to your place. No one answered." His voice was low and hoarse, tinged with hurt. "If Sebastian hadn't changed your flight details, I would have found you sooner."

She remained silent.

"I'm late. You're upset, aren't you?"

Ethan looked at her, his tone gentle.

Under the spotlight earlier, he had recognized Sophia immediately.

Seeing her dance with Sebastian, his hand on her waist, was agonizing.

Six years, and he had never shared a dance with her.

So when the chance to switch partners came, he didn't hesitate to let Isabella go.

He thought he could win her back like before.

With enough time and effort, she would always soften.

"Sophia, are you really going to be this cruel?" His grip tightened. "I know Sebastian and Alexander Laurent are just ways to make me jealous. It bothers me. It really does."

Words like that used to thrill her.

Now, they just felt too late.

When she realized she was constantly anxious about losing him, she knew their relationship was already over.

"Six years of feelings, so many memories. Can you really just throw them all away?"

Sophia frowned. "You're hurting me."

Ethan immediately released her. "Sorry…"

The music stopped, and she quickly stepped out of his embrace.

"I've already forgotten the past." Her voice was calm. "Once you make a choice, you should stick to it. Don't make every woman who's with you feel disillusioned."

With that, she turned and walked away, her figure disappearing into the darkness.

Elsewhere, Sebastian danced distractedly with Isabella, his eyes never leaving Sophia.

Seeing their unhappy parting, the corner of his mouth lifted.

He knew all too well how Ethan tried to win people over.

Gifts, apologies, sweet talk.

Unfortunately, it didn't work anymore.

"Sebastian seems pleased?" Isabella spoke suddenly, her expression innocent.

Sebastian raised an eyebrow. "Of course."

"Because Ethan was rejected?"

He looked at her properly for the first time. "Isn't that what you wanted to see too?"

Isabella admitted freely. "Yes. I want to stay by his side."

"Then I wish you a happy union." Sebastian released her hand and stepped back.

She smiled and nodded. "I also wish Sebastian success in winning his beauty."

Sebastian turned away, casting a sympathetic glance at Ethan.

He thought he'd caught a little rabbit, but it turned out to be a viper.

As the two men passed each other, Ethan spoke coldly. "Stay away from her."

Sebastian paused. "You have no right to say that."

"At least I was legitimate once. What are you?" Ethan's eyes were dark. "Without me, she wouldn't have given you a second glance."

Sebastian gave a light laugh. "Don't forget, you're in the same boat as me now. An ex and a pursuer. Both strangers to her."

He said no more, leaving through another exit.

…

Sophia returned to her room, removed her mask, and showered.

She walked out to the second-floor balcony, her hair still damp.

The night breeze carried the salty scent of the sea.

The sound of the tides rose and fell, soothing her restless heart.

In the distance, lights stretched into a continuous line, like fallen starlight.

The gentle night healed all unease.

The balcony of the next overwater bungalow lit up.

Sebastian appeared by the railing.

He stared blankly at her silhouette under the light, her fair skin seeming to glow softly.

Sophia seemed to sense something and turned her head.

Sebastian snapped out of it and opened his palm. "Your earring."

She instinctively touched her earlobe. She had noticed one missing when she removed her makeup.

"Thank you." She took it, but he didn't leave.

"I've been to many places, but only the Maldives makes me feel relaxed." He looked out at the distant sea. "Like this ocean. Vast. Accepting."

Sophia felt the same.

Before coming, the pressure from her thesis and Ethan's persistence had exhausted her.

After arriving here, her mood miraculously calmed.

Sebastian felt her gaze and asked softly, "Do you have something to say to me?"

Sophia looked at him with a complex expression. "Let's make a deal. Can you stop pursuing me? Knowing it's hopeless and still trying is just a waste of time."
###Chapter 55

A faint smile touched Sebastian Evans's lips.

His gaze rested on her face.

"I'll pursue you my way."

"Don't feel pressured."

Sophia Sullivan frowned. "Even if you're destined to be disappointed?"

Sebastian's eyes were deep and intense.

"I accept that."

Sophia pressed her lips together, silent.

The sea breeze brushed through her hair.

Sebastian said no more.

They stood quietly, listening to the waves.

He didn't leave until late into the night.

Sophia thought about his persistence.

Sebastian always knew his boundaries.

His pursuit was gentle and measured.

It never made her feel uncomfortable.

Unlike Ethan Roscente.

He had been relentlessly persistent before.

Now it was even worse.

He lost control and acted crazy at the slightest provocation.

Sophia sighed softly.

She turned to walk back.

A figure suddenly emerged from the shadows.

Silent and ghostlike.

Sophia stepped back, startled.

The man stepped out of the darkness.

The light illuminated his face.

"Ethan Roscente!"

Her heart was still racing.

"What are you doing standing here?"

Ethan had followed her out.

The ball had lost all meaning for him.

But Isabella Langley kept clinging to him.

He completely lost his patience.

He finally managed to find her room number.

Only to see the two of them standing side by side on the balcony.

Sophia's long dress flowed gracefully.

Sebastian stood tall and straight.

The sight was painfully sharp.

He stood there for a long time.

Waiting until Sebastian left.

Then he approached.

His eyes beneath the mask were dark and unreadable.

Sophia's brow furrowed.

"I've said all I need to say…"

Her wrist was suddenly gripped with force.

"Why is he allowed?"

Ethan's eyes were red-rimmed.

Sophia tried to pull away without success.

"What's wrong with you now?"

"I saw Sebastian Evans."

Ethan's voice was low and tense.

"Do you even know what kind of man he is?"

Sophia took half a step back.

"What are you trying to say?"

Her distance made him lose control.

"He isn't sincere at all!"

"Don't be fooled by him."

Sebastian was raised as the heir.

His mind was deep and hard to read.

His sudden change must have an ulterior motive.

He might even be using Sophia.

Sophia's expression remained indifferent.

"Whatever his motives are."

"It's none of my business."

Ethan's expression softened slightly.

But then she continued.

"You are also none of my business."

"It's very late now."

"If you don't leave, I'll call security."

Ethan wanted to say more.

But Sophia already had her phone out.

"Three, two…"

He could only leave, unwilling.

On the restaurant balcony.

Isabella Langley watched everything quietly.

Her expression was unreadable in the darkness.

Early the next morning.

Olivia Lopez finally returned to the room.

Sophia was having breakfast.

Simple and tasty milk and bread.

The electronic lock beeped softly.

Olivia was wearing a new dress.

She hummed a tune as she entered.

She picked up a sandwich and took a bite.

The bread was perfectly toasted.

Sophia looked at her radiant face.

"Did you have a good time last night?"

Olivia's eyes curved into smiles.

"Met a little sunshine."

"Great abs and everything."

"An absolute specimen."

The young man was from Korea.

Handsome with a great body.

He was still there when she woke up.

His milky skin marked with red traces.

His damp eyes looked like a puppy's.

She almost lost control again.

Luckily, she remembered the diving appointment.

And rushed back in time.

"Remember the deep dive today."

"We leave at ten."

The Maldives waters were brilliantly blue.

Famous for its deep-sea diving.

Fish and coral visible a hundred meters down.

Sophia felt both excited and afraid.

Curiosity ultimately overcame fear.

The instructor had excellent local reviews.

He was especially enthusiastic seeing two beautiful women.

He patiently explained the precautions.

Hand signals and equipment use underwater.

Olivia had experience and listened easily.

Sophia carefully memorized every detail.

She was a bit nervous practicing the hand signals.

The instructor patted her arm gently.

"Just relax."

"Imagine the underwater world."

"It will be beautiful."
###Chapter 56

Sophia Sullivan tried to picture it.

Her imagination offered only vague images.

But the instructor's words did help her relax.

The afternoon sun was perfect.

The water had warmed to an ideal temperature for diving.

There were two-piece and one-piece wetsuits.

Olivia Lopez chose a sexy bikini style.

Sophia picked a conservative one-piece.

Even so.

They drew plenty of attention when they emerged from the changing room.

Someone even whistled at them.

The instructor had them acclimate to the water temperature first.

"Don't be nervous."

"I'll take you to the safe zone first."

"Rescue personnel are nearby."

"Use the distress signal if anything happens."

"He will come immediately."

Sophia nodded.

Her gaze drifted to the azure sea.

A spark of anticipation shone in her eyes.

"Alright, ladies."

"Welcome to the underwater world."

"Hope you have a great time."

The instructor's hearty laugh was infectious.

A slight smile touched Sophia's lips.

She couldn't help feeling nervous as she strapped on the oxygen tank.

Olivia took her hand.

She pointed her thumb at herself.

Signaling that she was there, so no need to worry.

Sophia steadied herself.

She watched Olivia jump into the water with practiced ease.

She followed.

Her body sank slowly.

The light gradually dimmed.

Water pressure made her movements sluggish.

Olivia descended faster than her.

The current almost obscured her figure.

The instructor gave a hand signal.

Indicating they had reached fifty meters.

Sophia exhaled softly.

She began to relax and take in her surroundings.

A school of fish swam past.

A translucent jellyfish floated before her.

Like a tiny opening and closing umbrella.

She reached out to touch it.

The jellyfish instantly curled into a ball.

And vanished.

She couldn't help but smile.

Her tension melted away.

Olivia looked back and saw her lingering among the fish.

Her eyes bright, trying to catch them.

But the fish always slipped through her fingers.

Olivia swam back and took Sophia's hand.

She led her in another direction.

Soon.

A vibrant coral reef came into view.

Like a colorful little mountain.

The coral formations seemed endless.

Tropical fish darted and played among them.

It was beautiful, like a dream.

She finally understood how enchanting the underwater world was, just as the instructor had said.

She followed a school of fish through a coral tunnel.

While chasing a starfish.

A massive dark shadow suddenly blocked the light.

Sophia looked up.

A shark was hovering directly above.

She gasped.

The instructor said this was a safe zone.

No large creatures should be here.

She looked around frantically.

But she couldn't find Olivia or the instructor.

The shark was about to notice her.

If she didn't escape now, it was over!

Sophia turned and swam for her life.

The school of fish scattered in panic.

She gritted her teeth and glanced back.

The shark was already chasing her.

It was incredibly fast.

Coral was everywhere.

A dark hole for hiding was not far away.

She immediately changed direction and swam downward.

The shark's presence grew closer.

At the critical moment, she dodged into the hole.

Thump—

The shark crashed into the coral.

The impact shook the cave walls.

The force wrenched her arm backward.

Excruciating pain shot through her.

She tried moving her arm.

It still worked, thankfully.

She could surface once the shark left.

But within minutes.

Her oxygen suddenly grew thin.

Something was wrong.

The instructor said the tank lasted three hours.

How long had it been?

The oxygen was depleting rapidly.

The shark hadn't left.

Sophia broke into a cold sweat.

Just as she was about to give up, the shark finally swam away.

She desperately swam upward.

Making the distress signal.

Pressing the emergency button.

But there was no response.

She could only swim up with all her strength.

Her oxygen was nearly gone.

If she didn't surface now, it was over.

She didn't know how long she swam.

Her movements grew slower.

The feeling of suffocation set in.

Her limbs went weak, and her body sank.

Her eyelids grew heavy.

The surface was so close.

Just a little more to survive.

But she couldn't hold on any longer.

Tears welled up.

In the moment she gave up.

A familiar face approached from the distance.

A hand reached out for her.

"Sophia!"

"Sophia, wake up!"

Olivia dragged her onto the boat.

Quickly removed her oxygen tank.

Unzipped her wetsuit.

Air rushed into her lungs.

Sophia breathed deeply.

The next second, her lungs felt pierced by needles.

She broke into a violent coughing fit.

Choking up several mouthfuls of water.

The suffocating feeling finally faded.

She felt herself coming back to life.

"You scared me to death!"

"I thought you wouldn't wake up!"

Olivia pounded her shoulder while wiping away tears.

Sophia's voice was hoarse. "I'm okay."

"I saw your distress signal and came looking for you."

"You were already unconscious when I found you."

"My mind went completely blank."

Olivia patted her chest, relieved.

She didn't dare think about what would have happened if she'd been a second later.

Thankfully, she was safe.

Olivia hugged her, sobbing.

"I was so scared doing CPR on you."

"I was afraid you'd never wake up."

Sophia coughed lightly and laughed.

"So it was you nibbling on my mouth."

"I wondered who it was."

"You're awful—"

Olivia scolded playfully.

"How can you joke at a time like this!"
###Chapter 57

"She looks very pale. Does she need to go to the hospital?" The diving instructor, who had been ignored until now, suddenly spoke.

Sophia Sullivan finally noticed the crowd gathered around her.

Everyone wore expressions of immense relief.

Olivia Lopez snapped back to attention. "I've already called for an ambulance. Are you hurt anywhere else?"

"I think my hand is injured." Sophia tried to move it.

It had worked underwater.

Now it was completely immobile.

"What happened? Why did you suddenly sink?"

Sophia was silent for a moment. "I think there was a problem with my oxygen tank."

Olivia immediately picked up the discarded tank.

The exterior looked fine.

The bottom…

There was a tiny hole!

It was only the size of a pinprick.

But it was definitely there!

Olivia's sharp gaze turned to the diving instructor.

"That's impossible! Our equipment is replaced annually and rigorously checked before every use. We've never had an issue!"

The instructor looked serious, quickly defending himself.

"Even if there was danger, the safety zone allows for rapid rescue. Drowning should never occur here."

Olivia grew angrier.

"Are you calling my friend a liar? If I hadn't rushed over on the yacht, do you know what could have happened?"

Sophia glanced at the instructor.

His nervousness and anxiety seemed genuine.

He appeared just as confused.

Amid the arguing, Sophia spoke quietly. "I encountered a shark."

Olivia was stunned.

The instructor was incredulous. "That's impossible!"

"Blacktip Reef Sharks exist outside the safety zone, but they typically stay in deep waters over two hundred meters down. They're timid, avoid humans, and rarely initiate attacks."

Sophia said softly, "The camera on my diving suit should have recorded everything. You can check the storage card if you don't believe me."

The instructor was momentarily speechless.

"My God, what happened?"

The lifeguard arrived late.

He looked shocked, seemingly completely unaware.

The instructor scowled. "Kim, where were you? Why wasn't there an immediate rescue?"

The lifeguard raised his hands, smiling awkwardly as he stepped back. "Hey man, I went to the restroom. What's going on? Why does everyone look so serious?"

Olivia was furious. "Aren't you the lifeguard? My friend had an accident and was desperately calling for help. You weren't even here. I suspect you deliberately delayed."

In deep diving areas, the lifeguard is crucial.

His absence, had Olivia not noticed in time, could have cost Sophia her life!

The lifeguard, not wanting to take blame, shrugged it off shamelessly. "I just had a bad stomach. Nobody says you can't use the restroom during work. Accidents happen at sea. Your friend is fine, isn't she?"

He shrugged, his tone dismissive, infuriating to witness.

A chill ran through Sophia.

A sea breeze blew, making her shiver. "Achoo—"

Olivia saw they were just making excuses.

She wanted to pursue the matter, but hearing Sophia sneeze and cough, she couldn't bother anymore. She prioritized getting her onto the air ambulance.

At the hospital, a nurse, seeing she was soaked, brought dry clothes for her to change into.

Olivia, worried about her hand, specifically asked the doctor for a thorough examination.

Fortunately, the results showed no major issues. No bones were broken, just a sprain. A couple days of rest would suffice.

After getting some bruise-reducing ointment, the two took a seaplane back to the resort.

Olivia, still fuming, found the hotel manager.

The manager's attitude was acceptable, but his words constantly deflected, refusing to admit any fault on the hotel's part.

During the argument, Ethan Roscente returned from his outing.

Hearing them mention Sophia's name.

He learned what happened, that Sophia had encountered trouble while diving.

Though not present, he could piece together the harrowing sequence of events. A sense of fear for her washed over him.

He thought of how timid Sophia was, how she used to call him when home alone, needing to hear his voice to fall asleep.

Having just escaped death, she must be terrified.

He wanted to offer some comfort, but then noticed Sebastian Evans had arrived at some point.

He was now hovering around Sophia, being overly attentive.

Ethan fumed for two seconds, adjusted his expression, and walked over.

"Mimi, I just heard what happened. The ocean is dangerous. What if there's an unnoticed injury? The Roscente family has invested in a private hospital in Malé. Let me take you for a full check-up?"

Sebastian's eyes lifted slightly, his tone cool. "The hospital's report is on the table. Didn't you see it, Ethan? The downtown hospital is quite good. No need to waste time on another exam. Mimi just had a scare. What she needs now is rest. Understand?"

"It seems, Ethan, you're still not attentive enough." He paused, implying something. "You never really know what a woman needs most."

Ethan glanced at the report and sneered. "It's just a small clinic. How can you be sure the results are accurate? The Roscente体检中心 has top-notch equipment. The exam won't take half an hour. Seeing the results with your own eyes is most reassuring!"

Sebastian said, "I don't want to argue with you. If you truly care about her, let her rest now."

"Don't I want what's best for her? It's you, with your self-righteous tone. Sophia isn't your employee. She doesn't need to prioritize your demands."

Sophia watched the two men go back and forth.

From barely civil to sparks flying.

She just had a headache.

Too tired to watch them argue, Sophia returned to her room first.

...

In the darkness, Sophia looked around blankly.

A deep,幽 light enveloped her.

Her body swayed gently with the light.

She felt unwell, tried to raise her hand, but found her limbs heavy.

As if weighted down by stones, completely out of her control.

The terror of being dragged down, on the verge of plunging into the abyss, jolted her upright in bed.
###Chapter 58

The room was dark.

A deathly silence filled every corner.

Sophia Sullivan sat up abruptly.

Cold sweat soaked through her back.

It was just a nightmare.

She took deep, ragged breaths.

It felt like she had just fought her way up from the depths of the ocean.

Wind chimes tinkled softly.

A sea breeze drifted through the entryway.

The sound of the night waves was unusually clear.

The lingering sense of dread wouldn't fade.

She threw on a jacket.

And pushed the door open.

The late-night sea air carried a chill.

Sophia pulled her shawl tighter.

Her bare feet sank into the sand.

There were no stars tonight.

Only a few scattered street lamps lit the coastline.

The day's accident replayed in her mind.

Something felt off.

Some details had been overlooked.

Each incident seemed like an accident.

But their simultaneous occurrence was too coincidental.

The lifeguard insisted he was delayed in the restroom.

But that very insistence felt deliberate.

Sophia looked up.

Her steps halted.

Sebastian Evans stood with his back to her at the water's edge.

He was on the phone.

"...Attorney Chen, how should this be handled?"

"...A private settlement? Impossible. We'll proceed with an international lawsuit, no matter how troublesome."

He understood the hotel's attitude.

A seven-star international resort.

Occupying the best private island in the Maldives.

Even royalty stayed here exclusively.

They certainly had the capital to be arrogant.

Unfortunately, they picked the wrong person this time.

The call ended.

He turned and met Sophia's gaze.

Sebastian was momentarily taken aback.

Then a slight smile touched his lips. "Can't sleep?"

"Couldn't sleep. Came out for a walk."

The sea air was moist.

And carried a chill.

Sophia asked softly, "Just now... was that about me?"

Sebastian nodded. "Liability laws are different overseas. Consulting a lawyer is more prudent."

Sophia pointed to a sand house not far away.

A 24-hour convenience store was lit up.

"Want a drink? My treat."

Surprise flickered in Sebastian's eyes.

He thought she would avoid him like she did this afternoon.

He didn't expect an invitation.

He smiled faintly. "Alright."

Her invitation.

He never refused.

Sebastian got an ice-cold beer.

Sophia chose coconut water.

They sat on beach chairs.

Sophia said, "Thank you."

Sebastian ran his fingers over the bottle. "I'm just glad you're not angry."

He had already decided to have the corporate legal team file an international lawsuit.

She had a right to know.

"Am I that ungrateful?" Sophia laughed softly. "Besides, this probably wasn't the first time."

Sebastian raised an eyebrow.

Listening as she continued.

"They weren't shocked at all. Their first instinct wasn't to comfort the guest, but to make excuses. The whole process was handled with practiced ease."

Sebastian listened quietly.

Then handed her a business card. "Someone might contact you for follow-up. Call this number if you have any issues."

Sophia glanced at it.

Mrs.Smith.

Senior Partner at Morning Star Law Firm.

A top lawyer who exclusively served the Evans family.

She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear.

And thanked him again. "Thank you."

The Evans family's legal team was elite.

It would save countless headaches.

This was no longer an issue money could solve.

Sebastian turned to look at her.

His gaze was deep and serious. "I'm not a good man, Sophia. I'm not even a nice one. I'm only involved because it happened to you..."

The sea breeze brushed past.

Sophia avoided his eyes.

She looked out at the ocean. "What did you say just now? I didn't quite catch it."

Sebastian smiled. "It's alright if you didn't hear. I can say it again. Would you like to hear it?"

Sophia: "..." That won't be necessary.

...

Under the same night sky.

In an overwater villa.

Isabella Langley applied a face mask in front of the mirror.

You get what you pay for.

Skincare she could never afford before.

Now she could swipe without a care.

Ethan Roscente's supplementary card was in her possession.

No questions, no interference.

Using high-end products.

Even her skin texture had improved.

Ethan sat on the sofa.

His phone kept vibrating.

It grated on his nerves. "Isabella, your phone is ringing."

"Just hang up for me. It's definitely the academic advisor. So annoying!"

"Your advisor?"

"Yeah, I submitted a leave request before we left. Still calling. Is it really necessary?" She rolled her eyes.

Ethan: "...Was it approved?"

"Should be? Doesn't matter if it wasn't. We're already abroad. Everyone does this."

Ethan fell silent.

"I'm going out for a bit."

"Hey—wait for me, I'll be right ready…"

The only response was the sound of the door closing.

Ethan thought of Sophia again.

During university, their rare dates.

Were always interrupted by ringing phones.

Professor Eleanor Watson calling.

Once or twice was fine.

But it was incessant.

Data issues.

Citation errors.

Ethan would get angry.

She would pacify him while taking the call.

Her attitude always respectful.

"Doesn't it bother you?" he asked, frustrated.

She was surprised. "Why would it? It's my mistake. The professor is kindly pointing it out."

Yes.

Her emotions were always steady.

Even during arguments, she initiated communication.

Seeking solutions.

Never making unreasonable demands.

Sometimes Ethan felt her calmness was abnormal.

Her rational demeanor showed no trace of caring.

Isn't there a saying?

If a woman shows no emotional fluctuation around you.

She doesn't love you.

But Isabella was different.

Her emotions were easily swayed by him.

His glances.

His actions.

His words.

Made her insecure.

She used his mood as a benchmark.

Unconditionally accommodating.

Obedient to any request.

So.

After six years of mutual respect with Sophia.

Meeting Isabella.

Seeing her worshipful, admiring gaze.

Ethan was instantly captivated.
###Chapter 59

Ethan Roscente stood by the sea.

The night wind carried a salty dampness.

His gaze fell not far away.

Sophia Sullivan and Sebastian Evans sat side by side on lounge chairs.

They raised their glasses to each other.

Laughing and chatting animatedly.

Isabella Langley hurried over in her stilettos.

The sand made her steps unsteady.

"Babe, why did you suddenly stop?"

She followed Ethan's line of sight.

A naive smile curved her lips.

"Sophia and Mr. Evans seem quite close."

Ethan's expression remained blank.

"From a distance, I almost thought they were a couple."

Isabella chuckled lightly.

"Honestly, they look good together."

She looped her arm through his.

"Did they plan this vacation together?"

The sea breeze swept past.

She shivered.

"It's so cold…"

Ethan withdrew his arm.

He turned and walked away.

Isabella was left standing alone.

She bit her lower lip hard.

Soon, she hurried after him.

She glanced back toward Sophia.

Muttering under her breath.

"Tough luck…"

Back at the villa.

The shower was running.

Isabella studied her reflection in the mirror.

Her slip dress accentuated her curves.

Her skin was pale and smooth like jade.

Ethan emerged wrapped in a bathrobe.

Water droplets fell from his hair.

He headed for the liquor cabinet.

A pair of soft hands suddenly slipped inside his robe.

A warm body pressed against his back.

Isabella nuzzled his ear.

Her voice was seductive.

"Babe, it's been so long since you touched me."

"Don't you want me?"

Her fingers trailed toward the tie of his pants.

Ethan shoved her away abruptly.

"I'm tired."

Isabella froze in place.

The man turned and entered the guest room.

The door clicked shut.

Her chest heaved violently.

Her nails dug deep into her palms.

How many times had he rejected her now?

Ever since that incident.

He refused to lay a finger on her.

It was like he was saving himself for someone.

Absurd!

Inside the guest room.

Ethan turned off the light and lay down.

But the scene from the beach replayed in his mind.

Sophia's smiling face.

Sebastian's attentive gaze.

He tossed and turned, unable to sleep.

In the morning restaurant.

Dark circles shadowed Ethan's eyes.

Isabella carefully held his arm.

The elevator doors opened.

Sebastian Evans walked toward them.

The atmosphere instantly grew tense.

Sophia Sullivan and Olivia Lopez appeared from another entrance.

Sebastian immediately went to them.

"Good morning. Did you rest well last night?"

Olivia nodded.

Sophia smiled lightly. "Just too many mosquitoes."

"Care to join me for breakfast?"

"Sure."

The three walked directly to the buffet.

Completely ignoring Ethan.

His face darkened instantly.

He was about to step forward.

Sebastian suddenly turned back.

"Forgot something. You two go ahead."

Olivia waved her hand.

Sebastian approached Ethan.

"Come with me."

Inside the emergency stairwell.

Sebastian got straight to the point.

"Legal has taken over the hotel matter."

Ethan sneered. "Bragging?"

"The timing yesterday was too convenient."

"What are you implying?"

Sebastian's gaze was intense.

"You know exactly what I mean."

Ethan narrowed his eyes.

"I saw the footage. No signs of tampering."

His tone was mocking.

"Not everyone is two-faced like you."
###Chapter 60

He wasn't a fool.

After Sophia Sullivan's accident, he had considered this possibility.

He had pulled the surveillance footage immediately.

The results, however, showed it was all a coincidence.

The shark was an accident.

The oxygen tank was also an accident.

Sebastian Evans gripped his shoulder. "Listen to me…"

Ethan Roscente shook him off.

His gaze was icy cold.

"Stay away from Sophia Sullivan."

"Or else, don't blame me for being rude."

Sebastian watched him turn and leave.

A thoughtful look flashed in his eyes.

He hadn't mentioned Isabella Langley at all.

Did he genuinely not suspect her?

Or was he deliberately covering for her?

Isabella Langley stood there, anxious and uneasy.

She saw Ethan approaching with a dark expression.

She immediately put on a sweet smile.

She reached out and linked her arm with his.

"Baby, I've been waiting for you forever."

"Let's go get breakfast? I'm starving…"

She pouted her cheeks, feigning wronged.

She was being both delicate and playful.

Ethan gave a noncommittal grunt.

For once, he didn't pull his arm away.

He lifted his eyes and scanned the surroundings.

Sophia had already left.

As expected.

Sebastian's talk with him had an ulterior motive.

…

Sophia had been staying on the island for a few days.

She discovered it wasn't just incredibly beautiful.

The atmosphere was also open and free.

Tourists from all over the world gathered here.

Different skin colors.

Different languages.

It didn't hinder communication in the slightest.

One early morning.

She had just stepped out of the restaurant.

She ran into a "Black Beauty" head-on.

Fiery dreadlocks paired with a fluorescent green bikini.

Her beauty was bold and wild.

Sensing Sophia's gaze.

She enthusiastically blew her a kiss.

Sophia was struck by such direct, stunning beauty.

Her cheeks flushed.

She nearly choked on her own saliva.

Olivia Lopez turned to her with concern. "You okay? Do you have a cold?"

"No…" Sophia cleared her throat lightly. "I'm just a bit curious. Why are so many people wearing bikinis today?"

Plenty of people on the island wore bikinis.

But seeing them appear in such crowds.

This was a first.

"You actually don't know?!" Olivia exclaimed.

Sophia was bewildered. "Know what?"

"Oh my god, you came to the Maldives without doing any research? Today is the famous 'Bikini Day'."

"Ladies wear bikinis to the beach."

"Men each hold a rose."

"Surfing, drinking, dancing, all sorts of socializing."

"At sunset, the men give their rose to the woman they find the most attractive."

"The woman who receives the most roses becomes the princess of the evening."

"She gets a mysterious gift from the hotel."

Olivia winked mysteriously.

"I've already got mine ready."

"Guaranteed to make you slay everyone."

Sophia was stunned. "...Huh?"

Five minutes later.

Olivia urged her. "Are you changed yet?"

A small head peeked out from behind the door.

Sophia hesitated. "Isn't it… a bit too much?"

Olivia raised an eyebrow.

She directly pulled her out.

Pushed her in front of the mirror.

"Where is it too much? This is called beautiful, OK?!"

She nodded in satisfaction.

"Look at this tiny waist, these legs, this cleavage…"

"Hey!" Sophia hurriedly interrupted. "Stop talking!"

In just those few sentences.

Her cheeks were already bright red.

Sophia took a deep breath.

She looked at herself in the mirror.

A red bikini.

The boldest separate style with boy shorts.

The exposed skin was dazzlingly white.

The most embarrassing parts were the two pieces of fabric over her chest.

They were too small…

"No, I have to change."

"Don't…" Olivia's phone suddenly rang.

Sophia seized the chance to break free.

"Answer your phone, your blue-eyed puppy is calling!"

Olivia had no choice but to step outside.

…

"Baby, does this one look good?"

"Mhm." The man didn't even look up.

Isabella picked up another set.

"What about this one? Is the color too plain?"

"Not bad."

"This one is a bit sexier…" Isabella held it up against herself in the mirror.

She suddenly realized Ethan had been looking at his phone the whole time.

He hadn't been paying attention to her at all!

She frowned, ready to get angry.

But then she seemed to think of something.

Her expression quickly softened.

"Baby~" She fluttered into the man's arms like a butterfly.

"Help me choose from these three, okay?"

Ethan pointed randomly.

"That one."

"Ah! I like that one the most too, we're so in sync~" She bit her lip.

"I'll try it on for you, okay?"

"Mhm."

Isabella started taking off her dress right there.

As she unhooked her bra.

Ethan finally looked up.

The alluring sight before him might as well have been air.

He even frowned.

"What are you doing?"

Isabella froze on the spot.

Ethan: "Isn't there a dressing room?"

"...I'll go in now." Isabella picked up her dress and fled in panic.

When she came out after changing.

Ethan had already put his phone down.

He was massaging his temples tiredly.

This trip had been arranged in a hurry.

Work at the company had piled up.

Liam had sent an urgent document.

He had just finished dealing with it.

"Changed?" Ethan stood up.

Isabella: "Y-yes."

"Let's go." He walked out first.

He didn't even glance at her.

Isabella's enthusiasm was doused with cold water.

But she quickly adjusted her mood.

If he wouldn't look now.

Other men would look once they were outside.

He would naturally feel possessive.

Thinking of this.

She tugged the fabric on her chest down a little further.

"Baby, wait for me~"

…

The beach was crowded with people.

As far as the eye could see.

Men and women of all skin colors.

Bikinis and swim trunks in every color.

Isabella caught up to Ethan.

She deliberately didn't link arms with him.

They maintained a small distance.

Sure enough.

She received quite a few whistles and pick-up lines along the way.

Ethan, however, seemed not to hear.

He kept walking forward.

Isabella gritted her teeth in anger.

They arrived at the outdoor beach area.

Ethan lay down directly.

Isabella didn't know whether to stand or lie down.

Her limbs were stiff.

Her expression was awkward.

She was here for a vacation and romance.

Not to have her warm affection meet a cold reception.

But that "cold reception" was from Ethan Roscente.

She still felt it was worth it.

"Hey, beautiful, from China?" A handsome foreigner with brown eyes approached and started a conversation.

Isabella gave a sweet smile. "Yes, your Chinese is very good?"

"I'm a Mandarin teacher…"

The two chatted happily.

Isabella kept watching for Ethan's reaction out of the corner of her eye.
###Chapter 61
Ethan Roscente lay with his eyes closed, breathing steadily as if deep in sleep.

The surrounding noise meant nothing to him.

"My God! That is a work of art!" A foreign man suddenly exclaimed, his gaze burning as he looked toward the distance.

Sophia Sullivan followed his line of sight.

Olivia Lopez emerged from the changing room in a black two-piece swimsuit.
A white chiffon scarf was loosely tied around her neck.
The sea breeze brushed past, lifting it into a gentle arc.

"Like a black swan! Mysterious and elegant!"

Sophia Sullivan shot a cold glance at the man beside her. "Am I not beautiful?"

The foreign man nodded earnestly. "You are very beautiful."

"Compared to her?"

"Well..." The man frowned uncomfortably. "That young lady has more... allure."

Sophia Sullivan's face instantly darkened.

She was tall and fair-skinned, with wavy long hair full of charm.

Yet Olivia Lopez had chosen the most conservative style.
The black color made her skin appear even paler, like snow.
The semi-transparent white scarf added an Eastern subtlety that somehow drew more attention.

Just then, Ethan Roscente, who had been resting with his eyes closed, suddenly sat up.

The moment his eyes landed on Olivia Lopez, a flash of awe crossed his gaze.
It quickly turned into profound regret.

Sophia Sullivan trembled with jealousy, her fingertips shaking.

She's just a kept woman, a caged songbird.
How dare she steal my spotlight?

"Darling, would you be jealous if someone gave me roses?" she cooed sweetly, leaning against Ethan Roscente's shoulder to block his view.

Ethan Roscente frowned and pushed her away. "It's hot. Move away."

"Then I'll go buy you some juice?"

"Mmm."

The moment Sophia Sullivan left, his eyes immediately returned to Olivia Lopez.

...

"You really changed?" Isabella Langley looked over Olivia Lopez's outfit. "Black is too plain. The white scarf would be better with a one-piece."

Olivia Lopez adjusted her scarf. "This is more comfortable."

"Fine. Don't regret it later when no one gives you a rose."

"I'd prefer if they didn't."

But fate had other plans.

As the sun set, the rose-giving ceremony began.

Most of the men presented their roses to Olivia Lopez.

She tried to refuse at first, but the crowd's encouragement overwhelmed her.
###Chapter 62

She had to accept them.

She received more and more.

Isabella Langley stared, dumbfounded.

Olivia Lopez felt like crying.

Ethan Roscente's face turned stormy.

Sophia Sullivan looked at the few roses in her hand, her eyes reddening with anger.

Are these people blind?

Olivia Lopez even changed into a more conservative one-piece swimsuit midway. It was downright frumpy!

Yet, somehow, she held Ethan Roscente's captivated gaze.

A wide-brimmed straw hat with a light-colored ribbon accentuated her ethereal grace.

She simply stood there chatting and laughing with Isabella Langley, yet she attracted all the attention.

"Does it hurt?" Sebastian Evans appeared beside Ethan Roscente unexpectedly. "She never belonged to anyone."

Ethan Roscente clenched his fist, remaining silent.

"You can't hide her light."

Sebastian Evans withdrew his gaze, a faint smile curling his lips. "You lost your own rose. It's too late for regrets now."

A fist shot past Sebastian Evans's face.

Ethan Roscente sneered coldly. "You have no right to lecture me. She is the rose I nurtured. From her budding youth to her full bloom, every step bears my mark. Six years. Do you know all her preferences and habits?"

Sebastian Evans's eyes turned cold.

He knew Ethan Roscente was right. Over those six years, Olivia Lopez had left countless times, but she always returned to him.

This bond was far deeper than he had imagined.

Sophia Sullivan watched the two men vie for Olivia Lopez's attention, biting her lip in jealousy until it bled.

Why?

Why does everyone only see her?

...

Olivia Lopez received the most roses of the evening.

All eyes were fixed on her, as if she were the only source of light.

Isabella Langley took frantic pictures from the sidelines, jumping with excitement.

The blonde host announced with a smile, "Congratulations to this Eastern lady for becoming tonight's Rose Queen! Please unveil your mystery grand prize—"

An exquisite gift box was placed in Olivia Lopez's hands.

"Open it now?"

"Of course! Let's witness it together! Three, two, one!"

Olivia Lopez untied the ribbon as the countdown concluded.

Suddenly—
The helicopter's roar faded into the distance.

Sophia Sullivan stood still, the sea breeze tangling her hair.

She stared in that direction, unable to look away.

Olivia Lopez placed a concerned hand on her shoulder. "Sophia?"

Sophia snapped out of her daze and shook her head gently.

She tried to force a smile, but failed.

"Let's go back," she said softly.

Olivia nodded, linking arms with her as they walked back.

Sebastian Evans stood not far away, a slight smirk playing on his lips.

This game was getting more and more interesting.

…

In the hospital, Isabella Langley slowly opened her eyes.

Ethan Roscente immediately stepped closer. "How do you feel?"

She offered a weak smile. "Okay…"

The doctor finished the examination and confirmed she was fine.

They returned to the island via helicopter.

Ethan arranged for a doctor to accompany them and provide care.

In the room, Isabella leaned against the headboard, her face pale.

"Baby, I'm scared…" She clutched the hem of Ethan's shirt.

Ethan frowned but didn't push her away.

"The doctor is right outside. You'll be fine."

Tears welled in Isabella's eyes. "But it really hurts…"

Ethan was silent for a moment, his resolve softening.

He remembered how she had thrown herself in front of him without hesitation.

"Thank you," he said quietly.

Isabella shook her head. "I'd do anything for you."

She leaned against his chest, her voice soft. "You protect Sophia Sullivan. I protect you."

Ethan stiffened slightly.

Those words struck a chord deep within him.

He looked down at the girl in his arms, his expression complex.

Isabella looked up, her gaze firm. "I know you still love her, but I can wait."

Ethan didn't answer.

He only patted her back gently.

Outside, the sound of waves echoed.

The room was silent.

Isabella closed her eyes, a faint smile curling her lips.

She had won this bet.
###Chapter 63

My love for you is as profound as your love for Sophia.

You could never have her.

I can never have you.

So if you ask me what I want.

I only ask for a chance to stay by your side.

Her voice was soft as water.

Her eyes brimmed with sincerity and obvious humility.

Ethan felt a string in his heart plucked gently.

He promised solemnly, "Don't worry. I will take good care of you from now on. I won't let you get hurt again."

Isabella's lips curved into a slight smile.

She nestled into his embrace.

One arm wrapped tightly around his waist.

Her voice was sweet as honey. "I know. I've always trusted you."

Ethan tightened his arm around her.

Yet his heart felt inexplicably heavy.

For no apparent reason.

...

Such a serious accident occurred at the event site.

Hotel staff rushed over to handle the aftermath as quickly as possible.

Since it involved personal safety.

The person in charge directly called the police.

That very night, the police came to question everyone involved.

As expected.

They found out nothing.

In the end, they could only classify the incident as an accident.

After all, this was a tropical region.

There was a primeval forest right behind the hotel.

Snakes appearing was not unusual.

But a venomous snake? That's not so common, right?" Olivia spoke coldly.

The police were momentarily speechless.

"And it appeared on a crowded beach."

"That's even less common, isn't it?"

The police exchanged glances.

The hotel manager was also stumped on the spot.

Olivia let out a cold laugh. "This is the second time."

"My friend's life has been threatened twice on this island."

"Just wait. This isn't over!"

"Sophia, let's go!"

She finished, took Sophia's hand, and strode away.

"Alright, calm down. It's not worth it." Sophia advised softly once they were away from the crowd.

"You were almost hurt and you're this calm?!"

"It's like the emperor isn't worried, but the eunuch is frantic!"

Sophia smiled faintly. "Winning or losing isn't about a single argument."

"What do you mean? Do you have a plan?"

Sophia shook her head. "No."

Olivia: "..."

These repeated incidents were truly worrying.

What if something else happens...

Sophia, however, said, "I do have a plan for that."

"What plan?" Olivia blinked.

"Guess."

...

After all the drama and the scare.

Neither of them had eaten much.

Only now did they feel hungry.

They went straight to the restaurant for a full meal.

After eating, Olivia received a phone call.

She went off on a date, looking utterly delighted.

After leaving the restaurant, Sophia didn't return to her accommodation.

Instead, she walked north along the coastline.

After about five minutes.

Scattered lights formed a string-like line.

A scent wafted from afar.

It was a slightly pungent aroma of spices.

Like braising spices?

They eat braised food in the Maldives?

Sophia followed the scent to a shop front.

She looked up.

The three characters for "Taste of Home" in regular script came into view.

Opened by a Chinese person?

She pushed the door open.

Expecting a restaurant.

She found it was an antique shop.

The shop owner was braising chicken feet.

No wonder it smelled so good.

The shop was not big.

You could see everything at a glance.

Shelves lined all four walls.

Except for the shelf by the door which held antiques.

The others were all sorts of strange little trinkets.

Suddenly, a small sculpture, serious yet somewhat cute, caught Sophia's attention.

It was smaller than a palm.

But the craftsmanship was exquisite.

Every detail, from the folds on the shirt to the gold-rimmed glasses on the bridge of the nose, was lifelike.

Seeing she was Chinese, the owner became more enthusiastic. "You have a good eye, young lady. I made all these sculptures by hand. They'd make great gifts to take back home."

Sophia smiled and asked the price. "Okay, please wrap this up for me."

"Sure thing!" The owner packaged it and put a postcard into the bag. "If there's anything you want to say but can't find the words, just write it on this."

Sophia pursed her lips.

She initially wanted to refuse.

But it was a kind gesture, and it would be rude to decline.

Returning to her room and finishing her shower.

She saw the gift bag on the table.

She walked over and pulled out the postcard.

It depicted the most beautiful sea view in the Maldives.

She tossed it casually onto the table.

She wouldn't need it anyway.

...

Early the next morning.

Sebastian arrived at the restaurant right on time.

He circled around but didn't see Sophia.

Only Olivia was there eating breakfast.

A cup and a salad sat on the table.

"Morning, Sebastian!" Olivia greeted him with a proactive smile. "I've seen you circle three times, always looking my way. Want to have breakfast together?"

Sebastian raised an eyebrow.

He genuinely pulled out the chair and sat opposite her.

"Good morning, Miss Lopez."

"Morning."

Sebastian glanced at her cup. "That milk looks good."

"This is soy milk."

...

Awkward.

Olivia took a sip from her cup. "Do you have something to say, Sebastian?"

Sebastian dropped the pretense and got straight to the point. "Where's Sophia? I haven't seen her."

"Do you need her for something?"

"Can't I look for her without a reason?"

Olivia was both angry and amused. "Are you finance guys all this free at the end of the year?"

She had sensed something was off since Sebastian appeared on the island.

His various attempts to chat up and court Sophia in the following days.

His intentions couldn't be more obvious.

You could hear his scheming all the way back home!

Sebastian: "Not free. Very busy."

"Then how do you have time to come here on vacation?"

"Naturally, it's because there's someone here I want to see."

At this point, beating around the bush was pointless.

Olivia put down her fork, her smile fading as she sat up straight. "What are your true intentions towards Sophia? If I remember correctly, you and Ethan are supposed to be good brothers, right?"

Sebastian: "Every gentleman desires a fair lady. The intentions behind that are far too many to list, and not easily spoken of."

Olivia: "..."

"As for me and Ethan, we've fallen out."

Olivia: "I can see that. Because of Sophia?"

Sebastian remained silent.

Which was almost a confirmation.

"Haha..." Olivia couldn't help but laugh. "Serves him right! That bastard Ethan. It's high time someone shameless came along to put him in his place!"

Sebastian: "? Where are your manners?"

Olivia finished laughing, drank the last of her soy milk, and wiped her mouth. "Alright, I see. Then I wish you...early success in winning the fair lady?"

"I'll take that as a good omen." Sebastian nodded slightly.

"Then enjoy your meal. I'm off first."

"Wait, you haven't told me where the fair lady is."

Olivia checked her watch. "At this time, she should be... boarding her flight?"

Sebastian: "??"

Actually, even Olivia was surprised that Sophia's plan was to return home.

"You can't stay on guard forever. Since this island doesn't agree with me, I'll just go back home!"
###Chapter 64
Sebastian Evans left the restaurant, brushing past Ethan Roscente who was arriving for a meal.

Ethan's gaze swept across the room.

He didn't see Sophia Sullivan.

Isabella Langley looped her arm through his. "Looking for something?"

He withdrew his gaze. "You have a leg injury. You shouldn't be out."

"Lying down for too long is suffocating. I needed some air." She stuck out her tongue playfully. "Any longer and I'd grow mold."

Ethan gave a noncommittal hum. "What do you want to eat?"

"A sandwich and milk, please. Thanks, baby~"

By noon, Ethan had searched every restaurant on the island.

Sophia was nowhere to be found.

In the afternoon, he walked along the beach.

Still no sign of her.

At the Chinese restaurant that evening, he only saw Olivia Lopez.

Sophia was still absent.

Stranger still, Sebastian Evans hadn't been seen since morning.

Had they left together?

The thought made Ethan stand up abruptly.

He picked up the shawl draped over Isabella's chair.

A common style on the island. Sophia had one just like it.

He walked over to Olivia—

"This is the shawl Sophia left at lunch. Can you take it to her?"

Olivia was laughing with her male companion and answered without thinking. "Lunch? She's already back to—"

She suddenly stopped.

Her eyes widened. "Ethan Roscente, are you tricking me?"

The man's gaze was sharp. "She went back to the country?"

Olivia pouted irritably. "What's it to you?"

Ethan had his answer. He turned and left.

If Sophia was gone, Sebastian must have gone with her.

Olivia clapped a hand over her mouth in angry.

Ethan walked away, already on the phone. "Book the earliest flight back—"

Liam Evans asked, "Will Miss Isabella be joining?"

The man's steps faltered slightly.

"Baby, I heard there's a yacht gala the day after tomorrow. Let's go?" Isabella held his arm. "Since we can't go back yet, we might as well enjoy a few more days?"

Ethan was silent for a moment.

Liam's voice came through the phone. "Mr. Roscente?"

"...Cancel the booking for now."

"Understood."

Isabella looked apologetic. "You were on a call? I didn't notice..."

"It's fine."

She smiled. "The doctor said the wound isn't infected..."

Mention of her injury softened his expression slightly.

"Can we please go to the yacht gala?" she wheedled. "I've never been to one..."

He finally nodded. "If you wish."

"Thank you, baby~"

…

The wind at Kyoto Airport was bitterly cold.

Sophia Sullivan bundled her down coat tighter, but still couldn't suppress a sneeze.

After the freezing rain, the streets were glazed with ice.

Traffic was sparse late at night. The ride-hailing app showed a half-hour wait.

She blew on her hands, white puffs of air forming, and stomped her feet continuously.

A black sedan pulled up slowly.

The window rolled down, revealing Alexander Laurent's refined profile.

A grey turtleneck sweater accentuated his gentle demeanor.

"Taxis are scarce. I can give you a ride; it's on my way."

The car's interior was warmly heated.

Alexander handed her a hand warmer. "Warm up with this first."

Sophia's frozen fingers gradually regained feeling.

"I almost thought I'd freeze to death here," she sniffled. "Thank you."

Alexander adjusted the air vent. "There's a traffic control measure recently. Fewer cars are out."

She understood. "No wonder I couldn't get a cab..."

Then she grew curious. "What are you doing at the airport?"

"Picking up an elder relative, but she left already." He turned the steering wheel lightly. "I happened to see you."

The light turned red.

Alexander glanced at her. "Warmer now?"

"Much better." She smiled sheepishly. "Coming back from the tropics, it's taking some adjustment."

Suddenly remembering something, she took a small box from her bag.

"A gift for you."

Alexander seemed slightly taken aback. "A gift?"

"The Professor has one too." She handed over a sculpted doll. "It reminded me of you."

The doll wore gold-rimmed glasses and held a book, looking both cute and slightly absurd.

The man examined it for a moment. "Aside from the glasses, the resemblance seems slight."
###Chapter 65
Sophia Sullivan's eyes curved into crescents as she shook the small sculpture in her hand. "It looks just like you, honestly."

Alexander Laurent took the little figurine, a faint smile touching his eyes.

"Not anymore."

He accepted it anyway, thanking her softly.

Sophia waved a hand. "The light's green. You should go."

…

It was late at night by the time she got home.

Before her trip abroad, she had specifically hired a cleaner. The apartment was spotless, as if she'd never left.

Hot water washed away her weariness. She sank into the soft bedding, breathing in the familiar scent of her body wash.

Home really was the most comfortable place.

Alexander, however, had no time to rest.

His experiment had reached a critical phase. Even his trip to the airport had been squeezed into his schedule.

After a quick shower and change of clothes, he was ready to head back to the lab.

As he bent to tie his shoes, he glanced up and saw the small sculpture on the shoe cabinet.

The doll Sophia had given him occupied the most prominent spot on his bookshelf, surrounded by stacks of professional texts.

The corner of his mouth lifted.

It did bear a slight resemblance.

…

Mid-January brought a heavy snow to the city.

Sophia pushed open her window to a world blanketed in white.

It was just past eight, but the joyful shouts of children already floated up from downstairs.

A row of lopsided snowmen stood in the snow.

The largest one sported a pink pinwheel for a hat and fruit pits for eyes.

Returning from the market, Sophia paused. She took a small tomato from her basket and gave the snowman a red nose.

She studied her handiwork for a moment before nodding in satisfaction.

The beef at the market had been very fresh.

She selected some ribs, planning to make spicy beef strips. The rest would be perfect for a stew with sweet, fresh turnips.

"Knock, knock—"

The sound of rapping at her door.

Sophia wiped her hands and went to answer it.

Her neighbor from the third floor smiled and held out a basket of red eggs. "We've been blessed with a granddaughter. Wanted to share the joy."

The older woman had always been kind to her. Sophia was genuinely happy for her.

She offered some homemade mung bean cakes and salsa in return.

The neighbor tried to refuse, but eventually accepted.

"Oh, Professor Laurent is never home. Could you pass his share along to him?"

The auntie, in a hurry to deliver soup to the hospital, rushed off.

Sophia stared at the basket of eggs, feeling troubled.

Didn't Alexander dislike hard-boiled eggs?

…

By ten that night, it was snowing again.

Alexander shook the snow from his umbrella as he entered, weariness etched on his features.

The experimental data was finally corrected. With the minor holiday approaching, he had given the team two days off.

His key was just in the lock when he heard a door open behind him.

Warm, yellow light spilled out, illuminating the dim hallway.

Sophia's voice, warm and friendly, reached him. "You're home early today, Professor Laurent. The neighbor brought red eggs. Your portion is here with me…"

She handed him a small bamboo basket containing warm eggs and a thermos.

"The soup and eggs are warmed up. Have them while they're hot."

A cold draft swept in. She shivered slightly. "I'm going to close my door now."

Alexander murmured an acknowledgment.

The light vanished, and the hallway returned to silence.

His apartment felt emptier than usual.

He opened the thermos. The turnips were soft and tender, the broth rich and flavorful.

After a moment's hesitation, he peeled an egg.

Washed down with the hot soup, it wasn't so hard to eat.

Warmth spread from his stomach.

He leaned back on the sofa, enjoying a rare moment of relaxation.

His phone vibrated repeatedly.

He didn't need to look to know it was the family group chat.

In previous years, being abroad had allowed him to avoid family gatherings.

Now that he was back, there was no escaping them.

His mother sent her concern. His siblings offered their greetings in turn.

His father was brief and to the point, urging him to come home.

He replied to each one, promising to return as soon as possible.

The thermos was empty, save for two pieces of turnip.

It occurred to him that their next meeting would likely be after the New Year.

He wondered if she would be staying in the city for the holidays.

…

Alexander tried to return the thermos several times, but Sophia was never home.

She had already packed her bags and begun her journey home.

For the first time in six years.

Her finger hovered over the purchase button on the ticket page, opening and closing it repeatedly before finally confirming.

Some knots in the heart can only be untangled by facing them directly.
###Chapter 66

Eight in the morning.
The largest farmers market in the city was bustling.
Vendors' calls filled the air.

"Professor Sullivan, here for fish again?"
"Yes. Do you have sea bass today?"
"We do! Saved one just for you!" The middle-aged woman deftly scooped a fish and weighed it. "Just a moment."
David Sullivan took out his phone. "How much?"
"Oh, no charge! Please, take it! You've done so much for our Zachary…"
"I can't do that," David said, scanning the payment code. "A business must be paid."
His phone chimed, confirming a payment of thirty dollars.
It was significantly more than the actual price.

The woman started at the sound. "This is too kind…"
David picked up the fish. "It's what's owed. I'll take some scallions too."
"Wait, Professor Sullivan…"
"Is there something else?"
She wiped her hands on her apron. "I heard the second high school has recommendation spots for the physics Olympiad. A gold medal means guaranteed admission to MIT or Caltech?"
David nodded. "That's correct."
"Do you think our Zachary has a chance?"
David was silent for a moment. "The Olympiad requires knowledge beyond the standard curriculum. The questions are far more difficult than usual."
"The school typically recommends students with exceptional single-subject grades and an aptitude for competitive thinking."
The woman pressed, "Zachary is in the top twenty for his grade. Isn't that exceptional?"
"Grade ranking is based on overall performance," David explained patiently. "The Olympiad looks at a single subject. And the slots have already been finalized."
"I see…" The woman forced a smile. "Never mind then."
"I should be going."
"Take care. Come again soon."

Once David was out of sight, her smile vanished.
She spat in the direction he had gone. "Single-subject ranking, my foot! Pure favoritism! Such a hypocrite…"
"Mrs. Wang, what's the matter? Was that Professor Sullivan? I wanted to ask about my daughter's studies."
"Don't bother. He didn't even think Zachary was good enough."
"What happened?"
The woman sneered. "Said Zachary wasn't qualified for the competition. His own daughter entered so many back in the day. Why was it fine for her?"
"His daughter got into MIT, and now he can't stand to see others succeed!"
"Don't say that. Professor Sullivan isn't that kind of person!"
"I think he is! His daughter hasn't come home for years. Who knows what she's doing out there?"
"I heard she didn't go to grad school or get a job after college. She's some rich man's mistress!"
"You can't just say things like that!"
"If it weren't true, why wouldn't she come home? Ashamed, that's why!"

David Sullivan did not hear these whispers.
Even if he had, he would have remained silent.
In his eyes, his daughter was no different from a kept woman.

...

Sophia Sullivan stepped out of the train station.
A cold wind hit her face.
She tightened her down jacket.

The scenery outside the taxi window grew familiar.
The city had changed a lot over the years.
After the heavy industry moved out, tourism had flourished.
The streets were clean, lined with lush greenery.
The old town retained its original character.
The river divided the new and old districts.
In summer, people boated on it. In winter, a thin layer of ice formed.
Sunlight glittered on the ice like scattered diamonds.

An old arched bridge spanned the river.
The Sullivan home was right at the bridgehead.
Going through an alley, she saw the sign: "Faculty Residential Compound, City Second High School."

David Sullivan was a top physics graduate from Caltech.
He was specially hired to teach physics at the second high school.
He became head of the physics department within a year.
The Olympiad team he built produced many talented students.
They all received guaranteed admission to elite universities and were now highly successful.
His former students were everywhere.

His excellent teaching earned him the earliest housing benefit.
He was also the youngest teacher to receive it.

Thinking of her father, Sophia's eyes stung.
"...I taught you to study, and this is how you waste it?"
"For a man, you'd abandon your education?"
"I have no daughter like you!"
"Sophia, have you really abandoned your mom and dad?"
"If you leave, don't come back!"

...

"Miss, we're here."
Sophia snapped back to reality and scanned the payment code. "Thank you."

The Sullivans lived on the first floor with a small yard.
Her mother loved wisteria, so her father had built a trellis.
When it bloomed, the hanging purple flowers looked like a waterfall.
She loved relaxing in that yard.
Her father had built her a swing.
Later, the swing sat unused.
Six years had passed. She wondered about the wisteria and the swing.

Sophia blinked away the moisture in her eyes.
She stood before her home and took a deep breath.
She raised her hand and knocked on the door.
###Chapter 67

"Who is it?"

David Sullivan wiped his hands on his apron.

He glanced at the freshly braised fish.

He carefully placed it at the center of the dining table.

Then he turned to answer the door.

Isabella was trimming a potted plant in the living room.

She looked up at the courtyard. "Is that Ryan?"

"Ryan said he's coming tomorrow. It must be Mrs. Wang with the organic eggs. I asked her to bring some since your stomach's been upset—"

At the doorway.

Sophia Sullivan stood quietly, watching her father open the door.

Six years had silvered more frost at his temples.

Deep wrinkles now carved his once-square jaw.

She remembered watching the world from his broad shoulders as a child.

Now that strong back was slightly stooped.

Only his eyes remained clear and sharp.

Just as piercing as they were six years ago.

"Dad..." Her voice trembled.

David stared from shock to disbelief.

His face suddenly darkened. "You finally decided to come back?"

No sound came from the yard for a long moment.

Isabella put down her shears and walked out. "David? Who is it—"

Her words cut off.

A watering can crashed to the ground.

Sophia's eyes welled up.

Her mother was still elegant and beautiful.

Time had been kind to her.

Their eyes met.

She choked out, "Mom..."

Isabella's hands shook slightly.

Her lips parted several times.

But no complete words emerged.

Finally, she spoke hoarsely. "David... let her in first."

The living room felt as stifling as the air before a summer thunderstorm.

David sat stiffly on the couch, his face stormy. "Why are you back? Did you forget all your vows?"

Six years ago, Sophia had abandoned her combined Master's and Ph.D. program for a man.

He was the last to know.

That night, his blood pressure spiked, and he was rushed to the emergency room.

He had poured his heart into raising his daughter.

He never imagined she would throw away her future for love.

He still remembered traveling all the way to Kyoto to confront her.

She had stated firmly, without a hint of doubt, that she would never regret it.

The memory still made his chest tighten.

"I told you then. Go chase your love. We'll live our lives. It's like we never had a daughter!"

"Dad..." Tears streamed down Sophia's face.

"Don't call me that." David turned away. "I don't have the fortune to be your father."

His agitation caused his blood pressure to soar.

Isabella quickly patted his back. "You know you have hypertension! Why are you shouting?"

After scolding her husband, she looked at her daughter.

This child... her stubbornness was heartbreaking!

They had pleaded and scolded back then.

But she insisted on jumping into the fire.

Isabella had written about countless lovesick women.

She never thought her own daughter would be more stubborn than any character in her books.

Hopelessly ruled by her heart!

She hardened her own and said coldly, "Your father's health can't take this. If you still consider us your parents, you should leave now."

A sob caught in Sophia's throat.

Tears blurred her vision.

"Mom, Dad, I'm sorry. I know I was wrong..."

"Dad, I know you always wanted me to soar. I failed you."

She took a deep breath and turned to her mother. "Mom, you taught me a woman should be independent and strong. I'm sorry I failed at that too..."

"I came back because I missed you. And to beg for a chance to make things right."

All these years, she hadn't dared to come home.

She was afraid to see the disappointment in their eyes.

She also wanted to prove her choice wasn't wrong.

But reality had slapped her hard.

Not only was she wrong.

She was terribly, utterly wrong.

David's pupils trembled slightly.

She was finally admitting her mistake?

Isabella's nose stung.

If she hadn't suffered enough.

Her stubborn daughter would never lower her head and say "I was wrong."

"Do you really mean it?" David's voice had noticeably softened.

Sophia pressed her lips together. "I realized it a long time ago. I just didn't dare face you..."

She looked up cautiously. "Mom, Dad... can I stay for the New Year?"

David turned his face away to hide his tears.

He said gruffly, "Since you're here, you might as well stay."

Isabella let out a relieved sigh. "Why are you still standing there? Bring your luggage to your room! The food's getting cold..."

The tears Sophia had been holding back broke free again.

She cried and laughed. "I missed you so much. I finally found my way home."

Isabella's eyes glistened.

She reached out and pulled her long-lost daughter into her arms.

Six years of separation.

Their family was finally whole again.

...

They held each other and cried for a long time before gradually calming down.

David refused to admit he had been crying. "Haven't you seen someone with winter conjunctivitis before?"

Isabella rolled her eyes.

Pretend! Just keep pretending!

She gently touched her daughter's swollen eyes. "Look at you. You come home and make the whole family cry."

Sophia hugged her mother's arm. "I missed you... How have you been these past few years?"

David straightened up. "Perfectly fine! Don't you worry."

Sophia looked at them carefully.

Her father looked older, but his complexion was ruddy.

Her mother was so well-preserved she looked like she hadn't aged.

She unconsciously rubbed her eyes.

Isabella lightly slapped her hand. "How many times have I told you not to rub your eyes?"

"David, go boil some eggs for Sophia to help with the swelling. How is she going to see anyone tomorrow if her eyes are like walnuts?"

David nodded repeatedly.

The corners of his mouth turned up uncontrollably. "I'll go do it now."

He reached the kitchen and suddenly remembered. "I haven't finished cooking! After boiling the eggs, I need to hurry up and stir-fry—"

Isabella stood up, muttering. "Were you secretly trying to make my braised fish again? You never get it right, but you always insist on trying..."

"I saw you were busy. Three dishes aren't enough, are they? I'll go to the market and buy more—"

"Remember to get some pork belly."

"I know. It's Sophia's favorite."

Listening to her parents bicker.

A warm feeling spread through Sophia's heart.

She turned to look out the window—

The storm had passed.

The sky was clear again.

It felt good.
###Chapter 68
Evening.

A tempting aroma drifted from the kitchen.

David Sullivan walked out carrying a bowl of soup.

"Three Delicacies Soup. Just learned it. Try it."

The dining table was laden with dishes.

Braised pork belly with potatoes.

Stir-fried seasonal vegetables.

Steamed sea bass.

Braised pork meatballs.

All Sophia's favorites.

Isabella picked the tenderest meat from the fish belly.

She placed it in Sophia's bowl.

"Your father's fish is just okay. I tried this one. It suits your taste."

David immediately retorted.

"Just okay? I excel at being a person, not just cooking fish!"

Sophia couldn't help but laugh.

Isabella shook her head helplessly.

"Yes, yes. Your cooking is top-notch. You're amazing at dishes, fish, and being a person."

"That's more like it." David raised an eyebrow smugly. "Old Omelas next door even asked me for tips."

"Alright, alright. I'm secretly delighted." Isabella pushed his rice bowl toward him. "Eat now. Food can't even shut you up."

"You sound so dismissive." David turned to his daughter. "Mimi, isn't Daddy's cooking good?"

He placed another piece of fish in her bowl.

Sophia lowered her head and took a bite.

The fish was sweet and fresh, seasoned perfectly.

David knew she disliked strong flavors.

He only used ginger and scallions to remove the fishiness.

A light drizzle of soy sauce for steaming fish when it was done.

Enough to enhance the flavor without overpowering it.

In her memory, her mother rarely cooked.

Her father was the family chef.

After school, she would wait in his office for him to finish work.

He would ride his bike to take her home.

They passed the market, greeting vendors familiarly.

Isabella never bought groceries.

She didn't know how to pick them and found the market too noisy.

The only dish she could make was scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

Because her daughter loved it as a child.

Though she didn't cook herself, she loved critiquing her husband's skills.

David only became more determined.

He eventually mastered excellent cooking.

After leaving home, Sophia only had Ethan Roscente.

She cooked for him every day, waiting for him to return from work.

It was her father who had prepared everything for her before.

Now the roles were reversed.

She remembered she was also the baby her parents cherished.

"Dad's fish is still the best. Even a five-star chef can't compare."

David was both proud and emotional.

"Come back anytime you want to eat it. I'll make it for you."

Sophia held back the stinging in her eyes and nodded with a smile.

After the meal, Isabella brought a fruit platter.

The living room was empty.

She walked into the yard.

Father and daughter were gathered around the firepit.

The charcoal crackled, warm and bright.

Sophia sat by the fire, enveloped in warmth.

The flames danced on her face.

Isabella sat beside her and offered the fruit platter.

"The strawberries at home are ripe. You loved them as a child."

The strawberries glistened with water droplets, fragrant.

She took a bite, her eyes curving like crescent moons.

"Delicious."

Watching her smile, Isabella remembered how she looked when she first returned home.

Her heart softened. She held Sophia's hand.

Her fingertips gently brushed her daughter's cheek.

"You've lost weight."

Sophia puffed out her cheeks and shook her head.

"No, I haven't. I gained two pounds last week."

"Look, my hands are all flesh."

She pretended to be troubled.

"I was just thinking about going on a diet..."

David immediately frowned.

"Diet? You're already skinny as a bone. Is that attractive?"

Young people these days always copy influencers dieting.

Starving themselves, taking diet pills. It gave him a headache.

Sophia giggled and leaned into her mother's embrace.

"I was just saying it."

Isabella lightly tapped her forehead.

"Don't even say it. If you come back thinner next time, see how I deal with you."

Sophia laughed in agreement.

Isabella felt the weight of her daughter leaning against her.

Her fingers combed through Sophia's long hair.

Finally, she asked the question in her heart.

"These past few years... were you doing well out there?"

Sophia's gaze faltered slightly. She answered softly.

"I was fine."

"And that person? He didn't come back with you?"

It had come, after all.

Sophia lowered her eyelashes.

"We broke up."

After her father was discharged back then, her parents had visited her in the city.

But because of her stubbornness, they had a falling out and cut ties.

They hadn't spoken for six years.

Mentioning the past, Sophia expected to hear blame.

But in the firelight, David's expression was calm and accepting.

He only sighed softly.

"You were never on the same path. It's better this way."

Sophia's throat tightened.

...

New Year's Eve arrived in the blink of an eye.

Early morning, Isabella knocked on the door.

Sophia opened it in her pajamas.

Her eyes were sleepy, a strand of hair sticking up.

Clearly not fully awake.

"Who said they'd go grocery shopping with me yesterday? Look at the time. Hurry up, wash up, change, and come down for breakfast."

Isabella nudged her back into the room.

"It's only seven-thirty..." she mumbled, feeling like the sky wasn't even light yet.

Isabella laughed in exasperation.

"Seven-thirty is late? Hurry up. The soy milk will get cold."

With that, Sophia was fully awake.

She quickly got ready and went downstairs for breakfast.

On the table were soy milk, fried dough sticks, and the pork rib congee David had made.

The aroma was inviting.

Sophia nibbled on a dough stick, not seeing her father.

"Where's Dad?"

"The principal called him to school early. Said there was something to discuss. He'll be back later."

As Isabella spoke, her phone rang.

She walked into the yard to answer.

The call didn't seem pleasant.

Sophia had never heard her mother sound so impatient and wronged...
###Chapter 69

"You said my writing is worthless? Do you have any idea how damaging that is to a creator?!"

"...Yes, I acknowledge you're a professional editor. But that style simply doesn't suit me. Even if I need to pivot, I can't force it like this."

"...Let's both cool off. I'm hanging up now."

Isabella Sullivan ended the call and turned to meet her daughter's inquisitive gaze. She forced a smile. "It was the publishing house."

"Are you sure everything's alright?"

"Since when does your mother lie to you?" Isabella gently smoothed her daughter's hair. "Print media isn't doing well these days. Many writers are switching to online novels. My editor wants me to pivot too, but I haven't decided yet."

"Online novels?" Sophia Sullivan was taken aback. "What genre?"

Isabella's smile was strained. "Urban romance."

Sophia fell silent.

Isabella was a mystery writer. She had shot to fame early in her career with "The Weapon," which sold over half a million copies. Her subsequent publication, "The Deserted Village School," broke sales records.

That year was dubbed "The Year of Isabella Sullivan." She dominated the top five spots on the bestseller list alone.

Her current editor had sought her out during that time.

Isabella admired her editor's vision and boldness. Coupled with her sincere enthusiasm, Isabella signed a ten-year contract.

But after signing, Isabella's creativity hit a wall.

Her concepts were consistently rejected for not being marketable. Outlines that finally got approved were demanded revisions before she could even start writing.

After making changes based on her editor's feedback, she lost all desire to write.

She never stopped writing these ten years, amassing nearly a million words of practice work, but none of it was published.

It wasn't that she had no work.

Her editor had her write a young adult novel, aiming for film and television rights. Campus dramas were hot at the time.

But this wasn't Isabella's forte. The writing was agonizingly difficult, taking a full two years to complete.

By the time it was published, the market trend had already shifted.

Youth themes were being mocked as "whiny and self-indulgent."

Isabella was heavily criticized.

Her longtime readers accused her of "selling out." Critics panned her for "problematic values."

Netizens bluntly said she had lost her talent and suspected someone else was writing under her pen name.

Isabella nearly fell into depression during that period.

Fortunately, her family's support helped her gradually recover. But from then on, she stopped going online, even switching her phone to a basic model.

In ten years, aside from that one young adult novel, Isabella had no new publications.

"Let's not talk about this. Is the fried dough good?"

"It's good. Tastes the same as always."

Sophia looked at her mother, hesitating to speak. "The soy milk is just a bit too hot."

"Then let it cool a bit more."

...

With New Year's Eve approaching, the small town was filling with holiday spirit.

Red lanterns hung along the streets, and colored lights wound through the trees.

The local supermarket was crowded with scant supplies, so Isabella drove directly to the large downtown supermarket.

After parking, mother and daughter took the elevator to the first floor.

A large red "Fu" character sign stood at the entrance.

The supermarket was packed with shoppers stocking up for the New Year.

Their home had no children, but visiting relatives and friends during the holidays was a must. Students would come to pay New Year's respects, neighbors would drop by. Dried goods and fruit were essential.

Passing the snack aisle, Isabella picked up some brand-name candies and cookies.

Noticing the soy sauce, vinegar, and other condiments were running low, she restocked.

Reaching the seafood section, the live giant river prawns looked fresh. Isabella turned to ask her daughter, only to find her missing.

Pushing the cart back to look, she found Sophia loading raw chocolate ice cream into it.

Eating ice cream in the winter with the heating on had its own unique charm.

She had hoped to sneak a couple in, but was discovered so quickly.

Sophia blinked. "...Can we keep a couple?"

Isabella raised an eyebrow. "What do you think?"

In the end, Isabella left one in the cart.

"Mom, one is too few. Don't you and Dad want any?"

"We don't."

"Then I'll eat it!"

Isabella glared. "In your dreams. Just one."

Sophia pouted. "...Fine."

"Isabella?" A voice came from behind.

Mother and daughter turned simultaneously.

A woman around forty stood there. She wore a white suit, her hair swept up in a high bun secured with a hairpin.

She had a business-like yet artistic air. Her features were ordinary, but her highly arched eyebrows gave her a somewhat severe look.

"Editor Moore, what a coincidence." Isabella greeted her with a smile.

"Yes," the woman walked over to them, her gaze settling on Sophia. "And this is?"

Isabella: "My daughter."

"She's this big already? Last time I saw her, she was still in high school."

"Yes."

Nina Moore examined Sophia carefully. "She's getting more and more beautiful. Takes after you."

Isabella's smile widened.

What mother doesn't like hearing her daughter praised?

"By the way, about pivoting, which we discussed on the phone this morning. Have you thought it over?"

Isabella's smile froze.

Sophia finally realized this was her mother's editor.
###Chapter 70

Isabella Sullivan stopped abruptly.

"I forgot to get the thirteen-spice blend earlier. Clara, could you grab a packet from that shelf over there?"

"Sure." Sophia Sullivan nodded.

She understood her mother wanted a moment alone.

Once her daughter was out of earshot, Isabella turned to the woman opposite her.

"I told you this morning, I'm still considering it."

"Considering? I brought this up three months ago. You said you needed time, and I gave it to you. But you still haven't given me a definite answer."

Isabella frowned. "We've worked together for years. You know I only write suspense and thriller novellas, around two to three hundred thousand words. Now you want me to pivot to web novels? They're completely different genres."

"They're all fiction! Literature is universal!"

The woman's smile vanished, her tone turning sharp.

Isabella tried to explain. "Web novels are long-form, often over a million words. The popular genres are urban romance and billionaire marriage plots. Neither are my forte. How could I possibly write them?"

"Didn't you learn your lesson with 'Unripe Fruit'? How did that genre shift work out for you?"

'Unripe Fruit' was the young adult campus novel that had been brutally panned, tarnishing Isabella's reputation.

Editor Moore's eyes flickered. Her voice softened. "I know that book devastated your ratings. You've never gotten over it. You even withdrew from online platforms…"

"If you know I left that space, why are you pushing me to write cliché billionaire romance for the web novel market?"

"Isabella, please, don't get upset," Editor Moore said placatingly. "'Unripe Fruit' didn't break into the adaptation market because you were too slow. By the time you finished and it was published, three or four years had passed. The trends in film and TV had completely changed. Back when I first suggested the shift, young adult campus stories were genuinely hot."

"So you can't put all the blame on me, right? We both share responsibility. I'm not making excuses, just learning from past mistakes."

Isabella fell silent.

She admitted her pace was slow. But that genre was outside her expertise. Her thoughts were chaotic. How could she have written any faster?

Seeing her hesitation, Editor Moore pressed on. "This time is different. In the web novel market, urban romance and billionaire marriage plots are evergreen. It doesn't matter if you're fast or slow. The issues from last time, I promise, will absolutely not happen again."

Isabella's brow remained furrowed. "I read the web novels you sent. They're fast-paced, exaggerated for刺激. The beginnings are engaging, but they get progressively watered down. After a million words, even the protagonist's name might change. I'm not saying web novels are bad. Their popularity is justified. But they truly don't suit my creative style."

Editor Moore's gaze turned stern. "I've said all this, communicated for so long, and you dismiss it with just 'not suitable'?"

Isabella was puzzled. "What else? It genuinely isn't suitable."

"Heh," Editor Moore scoffed coldly. "Must I spell it out? Fine, let's be clear today. In the last decade, you've only published one novel. Its sales were abysmal. If you don't produce something new soon, what value do you have left as an author?"

"An author who can't produce works or generate sales—is she even still an author?"

Isabella grew angry. "I have many ideas, but you—"

Editor Moore cut her off bluntly. "Those ideas of yours lack distinction. They have no selling points. Publishing them would just waste ISBNs. They wouldn't sell at all! Do you still think you're the hot 'Queen of Suspense'?"

"To be blunt, you're outdated! Isabella, you need to face reality. And face yourself!"

"Mom—" Sophia couldn't listen any longer and stepped out from behind the shelf.

Isabella forced back tears, managing a strained smile. "Did you get it?"

Sophia held up the thirteen-spice blend. "Right here. It's getting late. Dad might be back from school already. Should we check out and head home?"

"Okay."

"Auntie White, we're leaving now." Sophia bid farewell on her mother's behalf.

She knew Isabella was too upset to face the woman right now.

Editor Moore smiled. "Alright, I'll browse a bit more." She looked at Isabella. "Think about what I said. Sigh. We're old friends, partners for so many years."

Isabella lowered her eyes, silent.

Sophia took the shopping cart and guided her mother away.

"Mom, did you sign a ten-year contract with Auntie White?"

"Yes."

"If I remember correctly, this is the final year?"

Isabella calculated silently. "It really is."

"What do you think of her as a person?"

Isabella paused for two seconds. "...Very professional."

Sophia smiled slightly. "Is the contract still at home?"

"Yes. Why?"

"Can you find it and show me tonight?"

Isabella: "What do you want to see it for?"

"Just curious. Can't I see it?"

"Of course you can! You can look at anything of mine!"

"Hehe... Mom, you're the best. Could you also send me copies of all the stories you've written at home over the years?"

Isabella was surprised. "They're just practice drafts, discarded manuscripts. Why would you want to read those?"

"I suddenly realized having a writer for a mom is really cool. I want to properly study your work. In case someone asks, I can actually talk about it! Otherwise, people might think I'm lying!"

As a child, Sophia had desperately wanted to read Isabella's bestselling novels, 'The Weapon' and 'The Deserted Village School'.

But Isabella always said they were "too bloody," "not suitable for children," and that she had to "wait until you're eighteen."

By the time she actually turned eighteen, Sophia had lost interest.

It was during countless nights after graduating college, waiting for Ethan Roscente to come home, that she finally read both books.

She had to admit, her mother was a suspense genius!

The logic, the suspenseful setups, the plot twists—all were flawless and impeccable.

No wonder these two books were still on the bestseller lists.

But in the last decade, her mother hadn't published any new suspense works. Sophia found it strange but never looked into the reason.

Until today, meeting her mother's editor, she seemed to understand the problem.

Since when could a publishing house editor afford full DIOR sets? And carry a Hermès crocodile skin Birkin bag?

What publishing house paid that well?

How come she never knew about it?
###Chapter 71

Her mother's voice came through the phone, but Sophia Sullivan felt only suffocation.

It wasn't an editor's care for an author. It was blatant control and suppression.

"Please? Just this once?"

"Understood. I'll send it when I get home. Don't complain it's too long to read later."

Sophia quickly promised, "I'll definitely read it this time!"

...

When she arrived home, her father was on a ladder putting up Spring Festival couplets.

He looked up, adjusting them for a long time, feeling something was off.

Sophia studied them from a distance. "Dad, the left side seems crooked."

"Adjust it a bit to the right."

Isabella Sullivan parked the car and walked over, squinting. "I think it's too high. Move it down."

David Sullivan obediently shifted the couplet downward.

Isabella shook her head again. "Too low now. Move it back up."

Sophia couldn't help but laugh. "It's perfect now."

Her father climbed down from the ladder, examining them left and right, his frown deepening.

Isabella suddenly clapped her hands. "Oh no! You put them up backwards!"

The couplets in the main hall didn't match the ones outside the door at all.

Her father coughed lightly, the tips of his ears turning slightly red.

Isabella said leisurely, "You've forgotten how to put up couplets after just a holiday..."

David Sullivan: "..."

Sophia turned her face away, her shoulders trembling slightly.

...

On New Year's Eve, the house was filled with the aroma of food.

Isabella had kneaded the dough herself, making her daughter's favorite pickled cabbage dumplings.

The thin wrappers held plump fillings. Dipped in aromatic vinegar, they made one's mouth water.

David prepared a full table of New Year's dishes.

There was chicken, duck, fish, and meat. Also local specialties like braised pork and steamed dumplings.

Symbolizing abundance year after year and continuous prosperity.

At five in the afternoon, the New Year's Eve dinner began on time.

The family of three sat around the table, filled with joy.

After dinner, Sophia offered to help clean up, but her mother quickly stopped her.

"Go watch TV. Your father and I will handle this."

Her father peeked out from the kitchen. "If you're restless, go play in the yard."

Sophia still insisted on clearing the dishes.

She washed fruit, cut it up, and arranged it on a plate. She opened snacks and put them in a basket.

By seven sharp, everything was tidied up.

Firecrackers gradually began sounding outside the window.

Sophia pushed open the window. Fireworks bloomed one after another in the night sky.

She rested her chin in her hand, enjoying this moment of peace.

Her phone suddenly vibrated.

It was a New Year's greeting from Olivia Lopez.

Sophia smiled and replied with a long message.

A video call popped up immediately.

On the screen, Olivia had curls cascading over her shoulders, adorned with a pearl hair clip, looking very proper.

Sophia smiled knowingly—this girl only dressed like this around elders.

But Olivia noticed her background. "Huh? You went back home? I thought you were spending New Year's in Kyoto again."

In previous years, Sophia would have been in Kyoto with Ethan Roscente.

Victoria Roscente had never liked her.

She felt Sophia wasn't good enough for the Roscente family. She never had a pleasant expression during their meetings, let alone invited her for New Year's.

At first, Sophia had been hurt. Later, she came to accept it.

If the other person didn't welcome her, she would keep her distance.

Ethan never involved himself in this.

He didn't mediate. He didn't ask. He always remained detached.

Looking back now, all those compromises and considerations seemed like a joke.

Men don't appreciate such things. They just take them for granted.

"I missed my parents, so I came back to see them," Sophia said softly.

Olivia understood how much courage that required.

"How are your parents? Send them my regards."

"We were just talking about you at dinner."

The Sullivan couple had known Olivia was their daughter's best friend since college.

Every holiday, they had Sophia bring back local specialties for her.

Olivia still remembered Mr. Sullivan's homemade salsa fondly.

"How long are you staying this time?"

"Probably for a while. I haven't spent much time with them lately."

Olivia understood. Her attention was suddenly caught by something.

"Oh, this is interesting." She chuckled. "Isabella Langley is showing off on social media. Ethan gave her a Hermès."

Olivia didn't even remember when she had added her.

"She called it a New Year's gift. The photo included two hands in the shot,生怕别人不知道 Ethan was spending New Year's with her."

"But then Charlie Lowell immediately called them out. He asked Ethan how he got home so fast after just leaving Morning Star Law Firm."

The comments section instantly became awkward.

Olivia pursed her lips. "Getting this excited over a bag? Didn't he give you anything you wanted?"

The best part was that Ethan had also posted two minutes ago.

In the photo, a wine glass was held tilted. The background was a bedroom nightstand.

On it stood a photo of him and Sophia at Beihai Park from two years ago.

The caption was only four words: 【Drunk. Missing her.】

"Serves him right! I hope he drinks himself to death!" Olivia cursed, then suddenly stopped. "It's the New Year. Let's not talk about this."
###Chapter 72

Sophia Sullivan's lips curved into a faint smile. "It's fine."

Despite her words, the air grew slightly tense.

Olivia Lopez's end suddenly became noisy. "Clara, I have to go. The family dinner is starting. My mom is looking for me."

"Okay."

The call ended. Her phone vibrated repeatedly.

It was a message from Sebastian Evans.

The international lawsuit and the acceptance receipt. Documents requiring her signature.

International litigation procedures were complex. The speed of this progress surprised Sophia.

She downloaded the files, signed them online, and sent them back.

He replied instantly, his tone teasing.

[Trusting me so much? Not afraid I'll sell you out?]

Sophia: [You wouldn't.]

Sebastian chuckled softly, his fingers tapping the screen.

[Relax. They're just necessary documents. Nothing more than filing the lawsuit.]

Sophia raised an eyebrow.

She had, of course, scrutinized the documents carefully.

If Sebastian truly wanted to scheme against her, he wouldn't use such clumsy methods.

Her phone vibrated again—

Sebastian: [Happy New Year's Eve. Hope your wishes come true next year.]

Sophia placed her phone face down on the bed.

His wishes had nothing to do with her.

"Clara, the dumplings are ready. Come eat—"

Isabella Sullivan called for her from downstairs.

She answered and went down.

At eight, the New Year's Gala began.

Sophia ate dumplings, sitting on the sofa with her parents, watching the show.

Her mother occasionally fed her a cherry.

Warmth overflowed.

At midnight, the countdown began.

Fireworks bloomed outside the window, dazzling and brilliant.

In the yard, David Sullivan prepared to set off firecrackers.

Isabella covered her ears, urging, "Be careful…"

The crackle of firecrackers erupted, heralding a smooth new year.

Sophia watched her parents. Her phone suddenly vibrated.

An unknown number. Area code: Kyoto.

She answered.

"Happy New Year."

A deep, mellow voice came through.

Sophia's lips curved into a smile as she watched the fireworks in the night sky. "Happy New Year, Professor Laurent."

…

Alexander Laurent guessed from Olivia's words that Sophia had returned to her hometown.

After the family dinner, he returned to his study to calculate data.

His pen paused. His gaze fell on his phone.

He dialed that familiar number.

The number they exchanged during their first meeting.

He had never initiated a call before.

The dial tone rang. His heartbeat quickened slightly.

The call connected. He blurted out, "Happy New Year—"

A soft response came from the other end, carrying a faint hint of laughter.

Alexander imagined her smiling face.

Fireworks illuminating her profile.

It must be beautiful.

…

On the first day of the new year, Sophia slept until eleven.

Sunlight streamed through the curtains.

She opened her eyes. Tree shadows swayed outside the window.

The sky had cleared.

She pulled open the curtains. Distant snow reflected the sunlight.

David and Isabella were basking in the sun in the yard.

Hearing the window open, David picked up his teacup. "Your mother spoils you. Sleeping this late. What about your stomach?"

Isabella stuffed a piece of orange into his mouth. "It's the new year. Stop nagging."

She looked toward the window. "There's breakfast on the table. Just heat it up."

Sophia smiled and replied, "Got it."

The sunlight was perfect. She joined them for tea.

"Dad, this tea is fragrant."

A light jujube aroma, sweet and mellow.

"Aged white tea. A gift from Ryan." David took a sip. "Quite good."

Ryan Sullivan, her cousin.

"You never liked tea before."

Sophia chuckled softly. "People change."

She once tried to replace alcohol with tea to help Ethan Roscente quit drinking.

He never quit, but she grew to love tea.

Isabella shot her husband a look and changed the subject. "The doctor told you to drink less tea. Yet here you are, drinking it every day."

David touched his nose and said nothing.

Before Sophia could finish laughing, Isabella turned to her. "A young lady shouldn't always stay cooped up at home. Go out for a walk."

Sophia was pushed out the door.

Standing at the alley entrance, she didn't know where to go.

She chose a quiet path.

Aimlessly, she wandered, stopping and going.

Without realizing it, she arrived at No. 2 High School.

Her former high school. The school where her father taught.
###Chapter 73

The campus was empty during winter break.

The wind blew through bare branches.

A security guard looked her over.

"Here to see a teacher?"

Seniors still had remedial classes.

He waved her in without waiting for an answer.

"Go ahead. Don't disturb the classes."

Sophia Sullivan nodded silently.

She didn't go to the academic building.

The sports field was deserted.

The honor display case was polished to a shine.

She stopped.

The girl in the photo had bright, intelligent eyes.

"Top Science Student" was written below.

The wind suddenly picked up.

The sky darkened quickly.

She raised a hand to shield her face from the wind.

She heard someone call "Mr. Sullivan."

David Sullivan walked toward her, carrying a stack of test papers.

He ran into Professor Zhu.

"Coming to school on New Year's Day?"

David smiled and nodded.

"Just dropping these off for the seniors."

"Is Sophia not coming home again this year?"

Professor Zhu's tone was concerned.

David opened his mouth to speak.

"She became a different person after going to Kyoto."

Professor Zhu shook his head with a sigh.

"Doesn't even focus on her studies anymore."

David's smile faded.

"Sophia is doing very well."

"Taking shortcuts is never good."

Professor Zhu lowered his voice.

"I heard she's with some wealthy man now?"

David's face darkened.

"Please don't spread rumors."

He turned and walked away.

Professor Zhu rolled his eyes.

"If she did it, why be afraid of people talking?"

Sophia hid behind the display case.

Her nails dug into her palms.

She had heard every word.

She couldn't imagine how her father felt.

David came out after handing in the papers.

He saw his daughter at the school gate.

"What are you doing here?"

"Just taking a walk."

The sky grew even darker.

"It's about to rain. Let's go home."

The bicycle pedals were stiff.

"I'm sorry," Sophia said softly.

"For not visiting in years."

David chuckled.

"Just coming back is enough."

Raindrops began to fall.

Mixed with snow crystals.

David was half-soaked by the time they got home.

Sophia went to get a towel.

She heard a sharp voice.

"Isn't that your Sophia?"

"Didn't she latch onto some rich guy?"

Sophia took a deep breath.

She put on a brilliant smile.

"Auntie White, what kind of bullshit are you spewing?"
###Chapter 74

Linda White's voice was loud and piercing.

She rushed over to Sophia Sullivan in a few quick strides, her eyes gleaming.
"My goodness! It really is Sophia! I thought it looked like you at the gate, and it is!"

This neighbor was famously nosy. Her husband also taught at the second high school.

Both families had moved into the faculty housing complex the same year.

Linda White circled Sophia, clicking her tongue in admiration.
"The big city really changes a person! Look at this style, this outfit. It's a complete transformation!"

Sophia pressed her lips together and said nothing.

"That dress is a designer brand, isn't it? Those shoes aren't cheap either! Sophia, I heard you're doing really well in Kyoto. You must know a lot of important people?"

Sophia frowned.
"What are you trying to say, Auntie White?"

Linda White lowered her voice.
"My second daughter is twenty-two. Pretty as a picture, and a great figure too... Do you know any suitable gentlemen you could introduce her to?"

Sophia's face turned cold. She took a half-step back.
"You're mistaken. I'm just an ordinary office worker in Kyoto."

Linda White's face immediately fell.
"We're neighbors! You won't even help with such a small thing? You've climbed so high, you should pull others up with you!"

Sophia let out a short, humorless laugh.
"What makes you think I have that kind of power?"

Seeing her refusal, Linda White's expression shifted instantly.
"Don't act so high and mighty! Everyone knows what you're really doing out there! Dressed like that, who are you trying to impress?"

"Linda White!" David Sullivan threw down his bicycle and rushed over, shielding his daughter.
"Stop spewing nonsense! My Sophia has always conducted herself with integrity!"

"Hah! Who are you trying to fool?" Linda White planted her hands on her hips.
"Everyone in the complex knows your daughter found herself a sugar daddy! Try silencing everyone!"

David trembled with anger.
"Slander!"

"Brave enough to do it, but not own up to it? Dressed like a cheap hussy. Disgusting!" Linda White spat, her saliva flying.

David clutched his chest, his breathing becoming labored.

"Dad!" Sophia hurriedly found his blood pressure medication.

When she looked up again, her eyes were icy.
"I tried to be polite, but you just wouldn't take it, would you?"

She grabbed the wet mop leaning against the wall and swung it hard at the woman.

Linda White shrieked and dodged.
"Assault! She's assaulting me!"

Dirty water from the mop splattered all over her.

Sophia gave a cold smile.
"Just finished mopping the bathroom. Haven't rinsed it yet."

Linda White caught a whiff of the smell and turned green.
"You little bitch!"

Sophia made as if to swing the mop again.

Linda White covered her head and fled. At the gate, she still managed to shout back.
"Your wretched wisteria is creeping into my yard! I'm burning it all tomorrow!"

Sophia raised the mop and chased after her.
"Show your face here again, and I'll beat you every time!"

After driving Linda White away, she turned and saw her father's complicated expression.

"Dad, I..."

David frowned.
"Where did you learn to act like that?"

Sophia was stunned.

"A young lady should be refined. You can't go around brawling like a fishwife."

Sophia linked her arm through her father's.
"Just tell me, did it feel satisfying or not?"

David coughed lightly.
"...Satisfying."

"Did she pull out all our wisteria?"

The empty space between their houses was originally a common area. Linda White had cultivated it for vegetables and often splashed manure water around. The Sullivans' wisteria had barely crept over the wall before she yanked it out by the roots.

David was mild-mannered, and Isabella wasn't one for conflict. They had put up with it all these years, which only made Linda White believe the land belonged to her.

"She said it was blocking the sun for her vegetables," David sighed.
"Your mother was heartbroken for a long time."

Sophia bit her lip. She hadn't realized her parents had endured so much.

"Dad, those rumors..."

"Don't pay them any mind! I know exactly what kind of person my daughter is!"

Sophia's eyes grew warm.

"Don't tell your mother. She tends to worry."

"Okay."

...

The second day of the New Year was for visiting relatives.

Isabella woke her daughter early.
"Hurry up and get ready. We're going to your uncle's house for New Year's greetings."

There were four siblings in the Sullivan family. David was the third. The eldest, William Sullivan, had dropped out of school early to work. He later made a fortune in the building materials business. Now he lived in a villa and drove luxury cars, a well-known local entrepreneur.

The grandparents lived with Uncle William's family. Every year on the second day, the whole family gathered there.

In previous years, only David and Isabella went. This year, Sophia joined them.

"Auntie, Happy New Year."

Sophia Sullivan stared blankly at the opened door.
"...Sophia?"

Isabella smiled and offered a gift.
"Happy New Year, sister-in-law."

"You didn't need to bring anything," Sophia Sullivan said, taking the gift box.
"We were just waiting for you. Come in, come in."

A sharp, high-pitched voice carried from the living room.
"Oh, Sophia's back? Haven't seen you in years. What made you decide to come home this time?"
###Chapter 75

Isn't she better than Sophia Sullivan?

Aunt Chloe Sullivan Sullivan worked at the power bureau.

She had a secure job, a leisurely life, and a plump figure.

She wore a bright green sweater with permed short hair, puffy like a Christmas tree.

"Keep it down," her husband Charles Sullivan pulled her back.

Charles was tall, wearing a beige sweater and suit pants, his slicked-back hair gleaming.

Nearly fifty, he showed no signs of aging, instead appearing quite dashing.

All three Sullivan brothers were handsome.

Chloe Sullivan pursed her lips. "Am I wrong? Sophia hasn't come back for New Year's in years. David and Isabella must miss their daughter."

She warmly took Sophia's hand. "A girl changes greatly from childhood to adulthood. You've grown more beautiful. Coming from the capital really makes a difference. Such good poise."

Sophia took off her long white down coat, revealing an apricot-colored sweater and a light brown woolen skirt with brown boots.

Her long hair cascaded over her shoulders, secured with a bow hair clip.

She looked clean, well-behaved, and sweet.

Grace Sullivan couldn't help but purse her lips. "Mom, you talk too much."

Chloe Sullivan glared at her. "Always on your phone. Learn from your cousin. You could take notes on her style!"

Grace wore a crop top and a JK skirt with snow boots, heavy eyeliner accentuating her eyes.

Her figure took after Chloe Sullivan's, with a thick waist and short legs, which this outfit highlighted.

Grace rolled her eyes.

"Where's William?" David Sullivan asked, not seeing William Sullivan.

Sophia Sullivan explained, "He's on a client call in the study. Even during the holidays, he's busy."

The grandmother said, "William is the boss. It's normal for him to be busy. We'll eat after he's done."

The grandfather nodded. "We can wait."

Sophia hesitated. "But that's not right..."

The grandmother insisted. "I said we wait!"

"Alright then. It's better to have everyone together for New Year's. Please sit, sister-in-law."

Sophia gestured for Isabella to sit.

"You go ahead, sister-in-law," Isabella said, taking a seat far from the elders.

Isabella was an orphan David had rescued from a river.

She had lost all her memories, her origins unknown, with no family.

David was the only Sullivan son who had gotten into Q University, once his parents' pride.

They had wanted to set him up with a factory director's daughter.

But he insisted on marrying Isabella, who had nothing.

The elders believed Isabella had seduced their son, called her a temptress, and held a grudge to this day.

Among the three daughters-in-law, Sophia was virtuous, Chloe Sullivan was sweet-tongued, but only Isabella was disliked.

Even David was cold-shouldered.

The eldest son was a boss, providing for them, far better than the youngest.

Sophia sat next to her mother.

Since her grandparents didn't like her anyway, why bother trying to please them?

She'd just eat this meal quietly and leave.

"Sophia, your bag is quite pretty. Is it a brand name?" Sophia Sullivan put down the fruit plate and suddenly asked.

All eyes turned to them.

Chloe Sullivan spoke first. "That logo is... Iouv, right?"

Grace corrected her. "It's Hermès."

"The one from TV that costs tens of thousands?" Chloe Sullivan gasped.

She'd seen it in dramas; all the wealthy ladies had one. Very expensive.

Sophia's Hermès was left at Ethan Roscente's villa. This was just a Picotin bag she bought herself.

She carried it to match her outfit. It had no logo; she hadn't expected anyone to recognize it.

Sophia Sullivan was surprised. "Is it really that expensive?"

She and her husband had worked hard to get where they were; they didn't care about brands.

They certainly didn't carry luxury bags.

The grandmother glanced over.

The grandfather also looked.

Sophia said, surprised, "I bought it on sale at a roadside leather goods store for just a few dozen."

Chloe Sullivan pursed her lips. "Even a good fake costs thousands. Yours must be a low-tier imitation."

Sophia nodded. "I just bought it because I liked it."

Grace lifted her eyelids to look at her.

Sophia Sullivan offered, "Everyone, have some fruit."

The discussion about the bag ended.

Chloe Sullivan said, "The cherries sister-in-law bought are so sweet and big. Are they 4J?"

Sophia Sullivan replied, "I don't know about J ratings. I just picked the most expensive ones. Ryan and his father love them."

Ryan Sullivan was the eldest uncle's only son.

"Is Ryan not back?"

Sophia Sullivan said, "He's busy running his company in Kyoto. Too swamped to come back for New Year's."

Chloe Sullivan said enviously, "Ryan is so capable..."

Sophia Sullivan smiled. "Just a young man fooling around."

"Too busy to come home, truly ambitious. No wonder Mom and Dad favor their eldest grandson."

The elders favored the eldest son's family. Ryan was their only grandson.

Chloe Sullivan was both envious and jealous.

She wished she had a son herself.

Thinking that the third brother also only had a daughter, she felt instantly balanced.

Earlier, Sophia had top grades while Grace was at the bottom, which bothered Chloe Sullivan.

Now, Sophia had graduated with a bachelor's degree but hadn't continued her studies or found a job, becoming unemployed.

At least Grace could rely on family connections to get a job at the power bureau and coast along, then marry a good man.

Isn't she better than Sophia Sullivan?
Chloe Sullivan pressed her lips into a faint smile.
Her gaze swept over the fruit David Sullivan had brought.
"Sister-in-law, you bought cherries too?"
"They seem quite a bit smaller than the ones at Eldest Sister-in-law's place."

Isabella Sullivan's smile faded slightly.
"Our family's circumstances are modest."
"How could we compare to Eldest Sister-in-law?"

Chloe Sullivan let out a light chuckle.
"That's certainly true."
"Big Brother and Eldest Sister-in-law's family... truly, no one can compare."

Sophia Sullivan's lips curved into a slight smile.
"Aunt Chloe Sullivan, what fruit did you bring?"

Chloe Sullivan's smile stiffened.

Sophia seemed not to notice.
She leaned over to look at the bag at her feet.
"Apples, pears, oranges..."

All common, affordable fruits.

"Aunt Chloe Sullivan, you really know how to pick."
"These are all the everyday staples."

The words pricked Chloe Sullivan's ears, yet she couldn't find fault.
"I thought to buy what everyone usually eats..."

Her family was well-off.
Both her parents were officials at the power bureau.
An only child, she had never lacked for money growing up.

But when it came to her own family, she was always calculating.

Sophia gave a light laugh.
"Aunt Chloe Sullivan is so considerate."

Chloe Sullivan fell silent.

Sophia Sullivan (Eldest Sister-in-law) cleared her throat softly.
"Don't just talk, have some fruit."

"Thank you, Aunt Sophia." Sophia Sullivan (Sophia) picked up a cherry.
"It's very sweet."

Chloe Sullivan found her own fruit tasteless.

She looked at her husband, seeking some comfort.

Charles Sullivan wasn't even looking at her.

"Mom, have a few more, they're especially crisp!" Grace Sullivan urged her.

Chloe Sullivan felt stifled.
"Eat, eat, eat, that's all you know!"
"You and your father are deliberately trying to upset me!"

Grace Sullivan: "?" Utterly baffling.

Charles Sullivan: "??" Completely unreasonable.

It was nearly noon.
The housekeeper had come to ask several times when to serve the meal.
Sophia Sullivan (Eldest Sister-in-law) looked at her in-laws.
"Shall we wait a little longer? William isn't finished yet."

The old lady nodded.
"Let's eat once everyone is here."

Another hour passed.
Sophia Sullivan (Eldest Sister-in-law) glanced toward the study.
"Mom, Dad, should we start? It's the New Year, we shouldn't let everyone go hungry."

"I'm not hungry," the old lady said, looking at her husband.
"Are you hungry?"

"Not hungry."

"Who's hungry?" The old lady scanned the room.

Silence.

"Then we'll wait a bit longer," the old lady decided.

Suddenly, a woman's voice came from the entryway.
"Wait for who? For me?"

A woman took off her down jacket, revealing a black suit.
Her hair was coiled into a neat, severe bun.

"Victoria?!" The old lady stood up.
"I thought you were on duty and couldn't make it?"

Victoria Sullivan was a bank branch manager.
She had originally said she was on duty.

"I had a subordinate cover for me."
"I'll just stay for the meal, then go back."
She bent to change her shoes.
"Eldest Sister-in-law, Second Sister-in-law, Second Brother, Third Brother, Third Sister-in-law..."

Her eyes fell on Sophia Sullivan.
"Sophia, you're back?"

"Aunt Victoria." Sophia nodded.

"You've grown up, become quite beautiful."
She examined Sophia's face.
Her gaze swept over Sophia's handbag, and she frowned slightly.

"Victoria, come have some fruit," Sophia Sullivan (Eldest Sister-in-law) called out.

Victoria Sullivan smiled.
She held out a small box.
"A New Year's gift."
"Eldest Sister-in-law, you've worked hard this year."

Sophia Sullivan (Eldest Sister-in-law) was surprised.
"For me?"

"Of course."

"This is too extravagant!" Sophia Sullivan (Eldest Sister-in-law) accepted it and set it aside.

Victoria Sullivan offered, "It's a solid gold bracelet."
"If you don't like it, you can exchange it for a different style at The Gilded Pavilion."

Chloe Sullivan tutted.
"Victoria, so generous..."
"Gifting a gold bracelet just like that..."

Victoria Sullivan raised an eyebrow, her tone modest.
"Eldest Sister-in-law has seen all the finest things."
"My little gift is nothing."

"We're both sisters-in-law."
"Eldest Sister-in-law has one, what about me and Third Sister-in-law?"
Chloe Sullivan smiled, half-joking, half-serious.
"You're a bank manager now."
"You wouldn't be unaware of social niceties, would you?"

Victoria Sullivan wasn't having it.
"Second Sister-in-law, you want one too?"

Chloe Sullivan's smile didn't waver.
"Who wouldn't want a gold bracelet?"
"Sister-in-law, don't you think?"
###Chapter 76

Isabella Sullivan was caught off guard by being put on the spot.

Chloe Sullivan and Victoria Sullivan both looked at her.

Isabella Sullivan fell silent.

"Sister-in-law, say something?"

David Sullivan spoke up.
"She doesn't like wearing jewelry."
"Even the pieces I've given her, she never wears."

Chloe Sullivan curled her lip.
She thought, Some country bumpkin. Doesn't even appreciate gold.

"Sister-in-law might not like it, but I do!"
Chloe Sullivan said shamelessly.
"Victoria, you're not just giving one to Eldest Sister-in-law, are you?"

Victoria Sullivan: "Sure."
"If Second Sister-in-law hosts everyone for a meal at your place, I'm sure there will be gifts."

Chloe Sullivan's face stiffened.

She didn't have a villa.
Her home couldn't possibly fit this many people.

"Think your place is too small? Treat us to a restaurant then," Victoria Sullivan said, cutting off her retreat.

Chloe Sullivan fell silent.

This many people would need at least two or three tables.
And the restaurant couldn't be a low-end one.

How much would that cost?
A single gold bracelet wouldn't nearly cover it.

"Oh, I was just joking, and you took me seriously," Chloe Sullivan said with an awkward laugh.

Victoria Sullivan gave a light, dismissive snort.

"It's almost two o'clock, aren't we going to eat?" Chloe Sullivan changed the subject.

This remark was even less well-received.

The old lady's face darkened.
"Didn't you eat this morning?"
"Are you that hungry?"

Chloe Sullivan was speechless.

Sophia watched quietly.
She glanced at the clock.

Making people wait this late...
Either he was genuinely busy, or he was putting on airs...

A sound came from the second floor.

"Why hasn't the meal started yet?"

William Sullivan descended the stairs.
He wore a polo shirt and casual trousers.

Middle-aged spread was evident, a prominent beer belly.
But his features still held traces of the handsome man he once was.

Chloe Sullivan secretly curled her lip.
If you don't come, who would dare start?

Sophia Sullivan (Eldest Sister-in-law) went to meet him.
"We were going to start, but everyone said to wait for you."
"Thought it would be better to have the whole family together for the New Year..."

"Why wait for me?" William Sullivan frowned.
"Let Mom and Dad go hungry?"
"At their age, can they handle that?"

"I..." Sophia Sullivan (Eldest Sister-in-law) was flustered.

"Why blame Sophia?" the old lady defended her daughter-in-law.
"We insisted on waiting."
"What kind of New Year's meal is it if the family isn't all together?"

Victoria Sullivan agreed.
"How can you blame Eldest Sister-in-law?"
"Eating a little later won't starve anyone."

William Sullivan's expression softened slightly.
"Then let's not delay any longer. Serve the meal."

At the dining table—

Chloe Sullivan turned her gaze to Sophia Sullivan.
"Sophia, didn't your boyfriend come back with you for the New Year?"
###Chapter 77

That incident involving Sophia Sullivan caused quite a stir back in the day.

David Sullivan and Isabella rushed to Kyoto overnight.

But they returned tight-lipped about it.

Rumors had already spread like wildfire.

Everyone said Sophia Sullivan dropped out of school for a boy.

They said he came from a wealthy family.

A rich kid.

No wonder she quit her studies.

She was desperate to lock him down.

David and Isabella looked grim.

Sophia remained calm. "We already broke up."

"Those rich types have high standards. He was just having fun with you. Did you really think it was serious? Marrying into money isn't that easy." Chloe Sullivan Sullivan shook her head as she spoke.

"Let me tell you, a girl's reputation is everything. You were together for so long. Didn't he offer any compensation?"

The wealthy men on TV are always generous during breakups.

Often paying millions in separation fees.

Maybe Sophia didn't come out empty-handed...

Chloe Sullivan felt a pang of jealousy.

A few years of sleeping around for that much money.

It's too easy for a nobody to become a phoenix.

Sophia Sullivan isn't some celestial beauty.

Why does she get all the luck?

Will the third branch of the family strike it rich?

Sophia looked directly at Chloe Sullivan. "What kind of compensation do you think I should get, Aunt Chloe Sullivan?"

"Money, jewelry..."

"Enough!" David slammed the table and stood up. "Watch your words, sister-in-law!"

Chloe Sullivan also stood. "What's wrong with me? Can't I show concern for my niece?"

"Is this your idea of concern?"

"What are you trying to say, David?"

Isabella stood and took her daughter's hand. "Chloe Sullivan, David means your words are hurtful, baseless, and completely inappropriate."

Chloe Sullivan thought she would mediate.

Isabella was usually soft-spoken.

Especially around her in-laws.

But she was surprisingly firm this time!

Chloe Sullivan was no match for both of them.

She kicked Charles Sullivan under the table. "Are you just going to sit there? Your wife is being bullied!"

Charles kept eating, not reacting at all.

Grace Sullivan also pretended not to see.

Smack!

The old lady threw down her chopsticks. She glared coldly at David. "Must you make a scene during the holidays? Your sister-in-law's words might be harsh, but she means well for Sophia. Do you have to be so petty?"

David said indignantly, "Mom! Listen to what she's saying! How can she slander her own niece like that? How can you take her side?"

"Chloe Sullivan's words are rough, but the reasoning isn't wrong. Even a normal breakup deserves compensation for emotional distress, let alone with a wealthy man from the capital? He should be generous. Otherwise, our family's daughter was just slept with for free?"

"Mom—" David's eyes reddened with anger. "Sophia is your granddaughter too! How can you say such a thing?!"

Isabella suppressed her rage and looked at her husband. "This meal has lost all meaning. Let's go home, David."

She had always been patient with the elders.

But when it concerned her daughter, she could retreat no further.

Otherwise, she wouldn't deserve to be a mother!

"Meaningless? It's downright disgusting! Isabella, Sophia, let's go!"

David left with his wife and daughter.

The old lady shouted at their retreating backs. "Ungrateful son! Corrupted by that vixen! How dare you defy your parents! You talk back ten times for every word I say! Go! Take that little vixen she bore and get out! Never call me Mom again!"

Isabella's defiance had humiliated her.

The old lady now loathed her daughter-in-law intensely.

She resented her son as well.

Of all people, he had to pick this one!

A son forgets his mother once he takes a wife!

They're all unfilial wretches!

...

The car ride home was silent.

Isabella gently held David's hand.

David smiled at her to show he was fine.

He was long accustomed to his mother's favoritism.

This wasn't the first unpleasant parting.

He used to endure it whenever possible.

But when it came to slandering his daughter, he could no longer tolerate it.

Isabella headed for the kitchen when they got home.

Sophia stopped her.

"Mom, I'll handle it."

"You?"

Sophia never lifted a finger at home before.

David always cooked and served her.

"Let me show you what I can do."

"Don't burn the kitchen down," David couldn't help saying.

Sophia was indignant. "Am I really that useless?!"

Her parents nodded in unison.

Sophia: "..."

An hour later—

David and Isabella stared speechless at the table full of dishes.

Stir-fried kidney, tomato beef brisket, shredded pork with garlic sauce, sweet and sour ribs, crispy chicken, roasted duck leg, two stir-fried seasonal vegetables, and a bowl of tofu soup.

Isabella swallowed. "You made all this?"

Sophia raised an eyebrow proudly. "Mhm~"

David took a bite, his eyes lighting up. "It's really good!"

Isabella: "Really?"

"Try it..."

"Wow!" Isabella tried a piece of rib and gasped. "When did you learn to cook?"

It was unbelievable!

Sophia said proudly, "Did you think I was just messing around these years? Eat up before it gets cold."

The family of three enjoyed a hearty meal.

After eating, Isabella and David were settled on the sofa to watch TV.

Sophia went into the kitchen to wash dishes and clean up.

When she came out, she heard David's choked voice:

"Isabella, our Sophia suffered out there."

"Look how skilled she is at trimming vegetables and stir-frying. She must do this often."

Sophia's eyes reddened.

It snowed heavily in the middle of the night.

A cold wind howled outside.

The people inside slept soundly.

Sophia woke early and heard David say, "It snowed hard last night. The balcony door is broken. Don't go out on the balcony these next few days. Be careful it doesn't collapse on you."

They had lived in this old neighborhood for decades.

The building structure was sound.

But the interior was worn with age.

Extreme weather could cause problems.

Sophia looked around.

She had lived here since birth.

The house hadn't changed all these years.

Only today did she realize how old and shabby it was.

Even the decor was over a decade out of style.

"...How can you say I ruined it? Which eye saw me do it? Don't think you can slander people just because you're some lousy writer!"

An argument sounded outside.

Sophia and David hurried into the yard.

They saw Isabella, eyes red, breathing rapidly.

Opposite her, Linda Moore stood with arms akimbo, looking smug and pleased.
###Chapter 78

Isabella Sullivan trembled with rage.

She rarely spoke harshly to others.

"Barbaric" was the strongest word she could muster.

Linda Moore didn't care, planting her hands on her hips with a cold laugh. "You call this barbaric? You haven't seen real barbarism!"

"You admit it? It was you?" Isabella Sullivan was incredulous.

Linda's eyes darted shiftily. "Watch your words. Admit what? Do you have proof?"

"Even if I did it, so what? Call the police! They won't even file a report for damages under five thousand. Think I don't know that?"

Isabella Sullivan was too furious to speak.

David Sullivan quickly stepped in front of his wife. "Linda, that's enough! Our wisteria didn't do anything to you. We're neighbors. Why be like this?"

Sophia scanned the yard.

Shattered wisteria blossoms littered the ground.

The trellis near the shared wall was snapped, hanging precariously.

The entire courtyard was a mess.

"You say it didn't bother me?" Linda rolled up her sleeves, encouraged by David's intervention. "Your flowers blocked the sun from my vegetables! They grew poorly and attracted bugs. That's not bothering me?"

"These frames," she pointed at the wreckage, "face my window directly. They ruin the feng shui. That's not bothering me?"

David laughed bitterly. "The central area is common ground. You're not supposed to grow vegetables there. Your plot attracts mosquitos. Did we say anything?"

"The trellis is in my yard, not encroaching on the common area. Professor Hao's trellis faces your window too. Why don't you go tear hers down?"

Professor Hao was famously short-tempered in the faculty housing complex.

Linda didn't dare provoke her.

She was purely a bully.

Linda sneered. "I just don't feel like tearing hers down. It's you I have a problem with. So what? Planting all these flowers, putting on airs! Buy a villa if you're so capable! Then you can have a front and back yard to plant whatever you want. No need to fight me for space. Right, Professor Sullivan?"

"You—"

"Poor man's fate, rich man's diseases. Disgusting!"

David wasn't a fighter. A few sentences left him fuming.

Isabella Sullivan couldn't get a word in.

Sophia wasn't good at arguments either.

But she walked to the corner and picked up the mop used yesterday.

David had just washed it. It was still damp.

"Auntie White, the mop from the restroom didn't teach you a lesson yesterday. Let's continue—"

Without giving Linda time to react, Sophia swung it.

"What are you doing?! Ah—" Linda shrieked.

She stumbled backward, landing flat on her back.

"Pfft—" Isabella Sullivan couldn't help but laugh.

David was already a pro. "Oh dear, Linda, so sorry. The child is willful. Are you hurt? If you fell by yourself, calling the police won't help. They won't file a report."

Sophia smiled.

When it came to intellectual comebacks, her father was the master.

Turning her own words against her. Perfect.

Linda's face turned ashen.

David added, "Oh, and this mop was just used to clean the toilet. It hasn't been rinsed. But it should be fine. Our squat toilet isn't very dirty. No big deal. You don't mind, right, Linda?"

As if she wouldn't mind!

"Dad, did you forget…" Sophia chimed in, "I poured yesterday's leftovers down the toilet. I flushed, but it's still greasy…"

"Auntie White, do you smell like garbage water?"

Father and daughter tag-teamed, saying whatever was most disgusting.

Linda's smug expression instantly darkened.

"You— you—" Her nose twitched, as if she actually smelled it.

"You just wait!"

She spat the words and hurried away.

A shower! She needed one immediately!

In that moment, Sophia felt like the "Ancient Greek goddess in charge of mops"!

Isabella Sullivan felt vindicated but disapproving. "...A young lady, waving a mop around. It's unseemly."

"But she's so hateful…" Sophia looked at the ruined wisteria, her heart aching.

David silently began cleaning up. "When the weather clears, I'll re-nail the trellis and move it further into the yard."

He preferred to avoid trouble.

He could bear the委屈, but he didn't want Isabella Sullivan to experience it again.

Sophia was silent for a moment. "Dad, people will keep pushing if you give them an inch."

Linda dared to do it today. She would dare again.

As she said, under five thousand, the police won't intervene. There's no way.

David sighed. "What else can we do? We've been neighbors for decades. I know what she's like. Living here, we see each other constantly. Constant arguing is bad."

Isabella Sullivan also劝道, "Forget it. She's made trouble before. Let's keep the peace. We can be the bigger people."

"Then…" Sophia thought for a moment. "What if we didn't live here?"

Isabella Sullivan and David dismissed it as a child's fancy.

Not live here?

Live where?

Move?

They didn't dare think about it!

No. 2 High School was in the most expensive part of the city. Property prices were sky-high.

Their savings might only afford a small two-bedroom in the suburbs.

David's commute to school would be nothing like the convenience of the faculty housing.

...

Early morning, the fourth day of the New Year.

The snow that fell all night had stopped.

Golden sunlight broke through the clouds.

Sophia woke up early.

By the time David and Isabella Sullivan got up, a hot breakfast was on the table.

Yam and oatmeal porridge, pan-fried buns, corn sandwiches.

"Delicious!" David gave a thumbs-up. "Almost as good as me!"

Isabella Sullivan rolled her eyes. "Our daughter's cooking is much better than yours."

David said, "Well, she inherited my talent! Natural skill!"

Isabella Sullivan, "...Right, right. You always find a way to praise yourself."

The family finished breakfast.

After cleaning up, Sophia suggested her parents accompany her for a walk outside.

David, always restless, agreed immediately.

Isabella Sullivan loved the peaceful winter sun.

Their daughter hadn't been home in a long time. The three of them strolled along the river near their home.

Sophia subtly guided them onto a different path.

By the time the couple realized it, their daughter had led them to the sales office of a trendy new development.
###Chapter 79

David Sullivan looked surprised. "Why did we wander over here?"

Sophia Sullivan was about to answer.

A sales agent from the property center approached them warmly. "Are you interested in viewing some properties? We have a full range of unit types. We can meet both starter home and upgrade needs."

Sophia replied, "Just browsing."

"Over here is our model display. You can see the overall planning for Phase Three is very comprehensive. The surrounding area has supermarkets, schools, and hospitals. It's very convenient for daily life."

Sophia's gaze swept over the model. "The distance between the buildings seems a bit close."

"Because these are high-rise residences, the buildings are relatively compact."

"I heard you also have a villa section?"

Lakeside Pearl offered two types of products. One was standard high-rise apartments. The other was detached villas.

The villas were only two stories. Their size was moderate. But they came with a front yard and a back garden.

They featured a modern interpretation of classic design. The layout included three sequential entrance courts. This met living needs without feeling empty. It had become a trendy development in the city.

Sophia had done her homework beforehand.

"I'd like to see the lakeside villas."

David Sullivan enjoyed gardening. He needed a large yard.

Isabella Sullivan liked reading and writing outdoors. She needed a quiet backyard. Preferably with a pavilion for tea and relaxation.

The agent heard her request for a villa. She could even name the specific type. She was clearly informed.

She quickly assessed Sophia. No makeup, but very pretty. Her clothes had no visible branding. She wasn't carrying a purse.

Based on appearance alone, it was hard to judge her purchasing power.

That face certainly didn't look like it belonged to someone short on money.

But...

"Sophia, don't talk nonsense." David hurriedly pulled his daughter aside. "Looking at the model is enough. Are you really going to see a villa? They'll take you seriously."

Sophia asked, "Dad, what do you think of this development?"

"It's nice. Several of my colleagues bought apartments in the high-rises here."

It was very close to the Second High School. Just cross the street and a five-minute walk.

But the prices were terrifyingly high!

With premium finishes and the prime location, the price per square foot was double that of other high-rise complexes.

"Should we buy one too?" Sophia's words were shocking.

David's eyes went wide. "Don't joke around. What if the agent goes to all that trouble for nothing?"

Isabella nodded. "Working on the holiday isn't easy. We're just browsing casually. Let's not waste their time."

David urged, "Let's go quickly..."

They kept their voices low, but the sharp-eared agent still overheard.

Her smile instantly faded.

All this time, they were just playing around!

That middle-aged couple looked like average working-class folks. What kind of money could they have?

And buying a villa?

Are they dreaming?

Sophia gave her parents a reassuring look. She walked to the model and asked directly, "Can we see the villas?"

The agent smiled. "I'm sorry. Our detached villas are only shown to VIP clients."

Sophia knew high-end properties had asset verification requirements. "What are the conditions for VIP clients?"

"First, you need eligibility to purchase property in the city. That's basic. Second, liquid assets in your account must reach two million. Alternatively, holding a black card from one of the top five domestic banks works. You can also provide other proof of financial capacity."

Cash, deposits, a black card—Sophia had them all.

She was hesitating which one to show. David already grabbed her arm and pulled her away.

As they walked, he muttered, "This is getting more and more ridiculous. Two million in liquid assets? We're not in a movie..."

Isabella whispered a complaint, "I wouldn't even dare write this in my novels. Yet you had the nerve to ask. Your years away have made you bold."

She then turned and smiled apologetically at the agent. "Sorry, the child is just playing around. We've wasted your time."

At this, the woman didn't even bother pretending. She outright rolled her eyes.

"Where did these bumpkins come from? Can't afford a villa, yet come here pretending to be rich. Are they insane?"

Isabella was stunned. David's face darkened.

But because they were in the wrong, they couldn't argue. They could only keep apologizing.

Seeing this, the woman became even more relentless. "People like you, wanting to buy a villa? You probably can't even afford a bathroom in the high-rise! What kinds of people exist? Such bad luck, running into you on the holiday!"

Working overtime during the Spring Festival was annoying enough. She thought a big client had arrived. Turns out, it was three paupers!

So infuriating.

Isabella frowned. "Even if we were wrong, your words are too harsh. We are still guests, after all..."

"If you can't take it, then don't come in! What kind of guests are you? Do you have any purchasing power? If you can't afford it, why look? My time is precious. It's not for you to waste!"

"How do you know we can't afford it?" Sophia frowned deeply. "Please show some respect."

"You say you can afford it, so you can? I could say I'm a billionaire. Boasting costs nothing."

Sophia sneered. "Even if I could afford it, I wouldn't buy from someone like you."

"Oh, talk to me when you can actually afford it then."

She sneered inwardly, convinced Sophia was a pauper pretending to be rich. She'd seen plenty of that type.

"Fine." Sophia nodded. She looked around, her gaze settling on a spot.

She walked right past the woman, heading diagonally across the room. "Are you staff here?"

The young girl wasn't very old, fairly new to the job. Her face still held a touch of naivety. She was holding a tray. Hearing the question, she paused, then nodded.

"Yes, I am... How can I help you?"

"Can you show us the floor plans for the lakeside villas?"

"Well..." The girl pressed her lips together, looking hesitant. "Company policy requires asset verification before viewing villas. So..."

"I know." Sophia nodded. She pulled a black card from her down jacket pocket and handed it over. "Will this do?"

The girl was stunned for a moment. Then she nodded vigorously. "Of course! Please, follow me..."

"Wait!" The ignored woman suddenly spoke up. She rushed over in her high heels, pointing at the black card on the tray. "It's not fake, is it?"
###Chapter 80

Ms. Cooper shot a cold glance.

The young girl looked flustered.

"What are you standing there for? Forgot the capital verification process?"

"Let the wrong person in, and can you handle the responsibility?"

"They said during training... if the card is fine, it's not my fault."

"Naive."

"This line of work relies on judgment."

"You need a sense of who can afford it and who can't."

"Don't waste your effort."

The girl pressed her lips together.

"Thank you, Ms. Cooper. But I'm still learning. It doesn't hurt to check."

She turned to Sophia Sullivan.

"Following procedure, we need to verify your funds."

"If everything is in order, you can view the property."

She politely gestured to David and Isabella Sullivan.

"Sir, Ma'am, please have a seat."

"Have some tea. It won't take long."

David quickly waved his hand.

"Please, don't trouble yourselves..."

His palms were sweating.

Was his daughter serious?

Wouldn't the fund check expose them?

Maybe they should just leave now.

Isabella appeared calm.

She sat down and picked up a teacup.

But her fingers trembled slightly.

"This way, please—"

Sophia nodded and entered the office.

"Putting on an act..." the woman sneered, arms crossed.

Ten minutes later.

They emerged from the office.

The woman immediately blocked their path.

"Fake card, right?"

No one paid her any attention.

"Miss, are you sure you don't want to reconsider?" the young girl, Gigi, asked carefully.

"Yes."

"Perhaps you'd like to see the actual site? The environment and location are clearer in person..."

"I saw the model."

"But..."

How could a model compare to the real thing?

It's a multi-million dollar house!

"Quite the performance," the woman laughed mockingly. "Gigi, consider this a lesson. Remember it for next time."

Gigi looked down, embarrassed.

"Ms. Cooper, you've misunderstood..."

"Misunderstood? Was the card real?"

"It was real!"

"Dreaming?" The woman rolled her eyes.

Gigi felt helpless.

How could she make her believe?

"Miss, are you absolutely sure?" Gigi confirmed again.

"Just prepare the contract."

Sophia's tone was even.

She had done her research beforehand.

She knew the layout, orientation, hardware, and software.

No need to see more.

Gigi's eyes lit up.

"Payment method?"

"Full payment."

David was stunned.

Was his daughter really buying?

He opened his mouth to speak.

Isabella pinched his side.

"Don't say a word."

Gigi took the bank card with both hands.

She prepared the contract.

"If everything looks correct, we can process the payment now."

Sophia nodded.

"Go ahead."

Gigi processed the payment in a daze.

The contract was signed.

Finance confirmed the receipt of five million.

She finally snapped back to reality.

Oh my god!

She sold the crown jewel property on her second day?

Five million, full payment!

A commission of several hundred thousand!

She couldn't help but grin foolishly.

She composed herself after seeing the woman's livid face.

The woman's eyes widened in shock.

"She actually bought it?"

"The contract is signed."

Sophia walked straight past.

"Mom, Dad, shall we go pack?"

David was bewildered.

"Pack what?"

"Clothes and daily necessities for the move."

David nodded numbly.

"Right... should pack..."

But what new home?

Even after leaving the sales office, David felt dizzy.

Back home.

He sat down, rubbing his hands.

"Clara, you bought a house?"

Sophia nodded.

"A villa?"

She nodded again.

"Full payment?"

Another nod.

David was silent for a long time.

"Such a big decision... why didn't you discuss it?"

Sophia explained softly.

"The old house has needed repairs for years. It's normal to get a new one."

"I wanted to surprise you."

David frowned deeply.

"How much?"

Sophia held up five fingers.

"Five million?"

His heart trembled.

"Where did you get that much money? From credit cards? Or..."
###Chapter 81

Loan sharking?

Five hundred thousand.

He could never earn that much in his lifetime.

Sophia lowered her eyelids.
"I've saved some money over the years."

Isabella spoke suddenly.
"How did you save it?"

Her gaze was scrutinizing.

Sophia knew she couldn't hide it anymore.
The rumors outside, her mother must have heard some of them.

"Mom, I earned all this money myself. It's clean."
She was telling the truth.

Back then, Ethan Roscente had completely fallen out with his family to be with her.
Jiang Jiuyao cut off all his financial support.
Victoria Roscente didn't dare secretly help him either.

During their hardest times, they lived in a ten-square-meter basement.
The roof leaked when it rained, and the blankets were always damp.

Ethan wanted to start a business but lacked seed funding.
Sophia worked three jobs every day to save money.

Later, she joined a biotech company.
Her job was to trial beauty products and record skin data.

By chance, she wrote a program.
It could efficiently process large volumes of sample data.

The company offered five hundred thousand to buy it outright.
Sophia didn't agree immediately.

She went back and told Ethan.
He eventually closed the deal for two million.

It was his first pot of gold.
Two years later, the company went public.
Ethan became a rising star in the business world.

On the day of the bell ringing, he told Sophia the company was half hers.
That night, he gave her a check for 7.2 million USD and a land deed.

Their relationship was good then.
Sophia looked at him in surprise.

"Why are you giving me this?"
"From now on, you're a little rich lady."

She didn't want the money or to be a landlady.
She just wanted to be Mrs. Roscente, properly and rightfully.

Ethan insisted on putting the items in a drawer.
"I never take back what I give."

Sophia didn't pay it much mind.
She wouldn't use it anyway.

Later, they argued constantly.
But she never once thought of touching that money.

Not until she decided to leave him.

Thinking about it now, if Ethan had truly wanted to marry her,
he should have given her company shares, not cash and land.

The two million from six years ago, plus all her years of effort.
She could take this 7.2 million with a clear conscience.

She just didn't want her parents to know about these twists and turns.
It would only upset them needlessly.

Isabella could tell her daughter was holding something back.
But since she said it was clean, then it must be true.

"So I really get to live in a villa?" Isabella set aside her worries, her face full of anticipation.
Sophia nodded. "They're ready to move in. We can stay tonight. Everything is provided except personal items."

"There's a rockery and fish pond in the front yard. The backyard is perfect for planting flowers."
David Sullivan's eyes lit up. "It's that big?"

"You'll see when you go take a look. You can start buying seeds early..."
"I'm placing an order right now! A flower stand first, your mom loves wisteria... and a few hydrangea pots, their blooms will make Old Xie so jealous..."

Old Xie was David's colleague.
They were both gardening enthusiasts.

Professor Xie had moved out of the faculty housing complex long ago.
He bought a condominium on the first floor with a small yard.

The yard wasn't big, only suitable for a few potted plants.
He couldn't grow things like hydrangeas at all.

David excitedly scrolled through his phone.
Suddenly, he paused. "What about the old house when we move to the new place?"

Sophia: "We'll keep it."
"Is that necessary?" David was thinking of selling it to help his daughter.

Sophia saw what he was thinking.
"Even if we don't live there, let's keep it."

David was puzzled. "What are we waiting for?"
"You'll know when the time comes."

"Being so mysterious..." David muttered.

It wasn't that Sophia didn't want to say.
The fewer people who knew about the demolition, the better.
A leaked rumor would just cause trouble.

She knew about it thanks to Ethan.
She had accidentally seen the development contract in his study.

The planned area included the No.2 High School faculty housing complex.
The plan had only one word—Demolish!

"The sales office said to go complete the paperwork tomorrow."
David: "Should I move some potted plants over first?"

Sophia: "Sure, we have the keys. You can move anytime."
Isabella: "Then I'll pack some clothes to bring over."

...

Early the next morning.
David was busy moving flower pots.
Isabella was packing clothes and shoes.

David called a auto rickshaw.
The cargo bed was filled with flower pots.

He squeezed into the passenger seat.
"Sophia, I'll go ahead. You go with your mom to the sales office. I'll find you after I'm done."

"Okay."

10 AM, sales office.
Gigi was already waiting at the door.

Seeing Sophia, she smiled and waved.
The paperwork was completed quickly.

Ten minutes later, mother and daughter walked out of the VIP room.
"Sister-in-law? Sophia?" A voice came from behind.

Isabella turned. "Second Brother?"
Charles Sullivan was dressed in a suit, his hair slicked and shiny.

He looked more imposing than his boss, William Sullivan.
"What are you doing here?"

Isabella: "We came to..."
"You disappeared in the blink of an eye. I told you to listen carefully to the presentation..."

Chloe Sullivan Sullivan's complaint cut off abruptly.
She saw Isabella and froze instantly.
###Chapter 82

A Good-for-Nothing Who Still Lives Off Her Parents?

Chloe Sullivan beamed and quickly stepped forward, linking arms with Charles Sullivan.

"What a coincidence, sister-in-law! Fancy meeting you both here."

Isabella Sullivan smiled and nodded. "Second sister-in-law."

"What brings you to the sales office? Don't tell me you're looking to buy a place?"

"No." They had already bought one yesterday.

"Is that so..." Chloe Sullivan's eyes swept over Isabella Sullivan from head to toe, her smile widening. "We're here to look at a place. This one, Lakeside Pearl. It's the hottest new development right now! I heard the high-rise units are especially scarce. Some people are even paying over the asking price and still can't get one!"

"Luckily, Qianqian has connections. She knows the sales manager here, so they held a unit for us."

"We just finished signing the contract."

Chloe Sullivan was practically glowing with pride.

The corners of her mouth were almost reaching her ears. Seeing the surprised look on Isabella Sullivan's face made her absolutely delighted.

Didn't expect that, did you?

Jealous?

Feeling sour?

Too bad you can't afford it.

Isabella Sullivan was indeed surprised, but what shocked her was that her second brother and his wife were already looking to move again.

Hadn't they just moved into a new place three years ago?

Why move again already?

"...Sigh, that place was just too small. Uncomfortable to live in. The environment and amenities don't compare to here at all."

Isabella Sullivan nodded. "So are you planning to sell or rent out your current place..."

Charles Sullivan began, "We plan to—"

He was cut off as Chloe Sullivan tugged sharply on his arm. She raised an eyebrow and laughed. "We're not selling or renting. It's not like we need the money. Better to hold onto it and let it appreciate, right?"

The Zhou family was well-off, and Chloe Sullivan's parents doted on her. She certainly had the right to say such things.

"Sister-in-law, you haven't seen the high-rise units here, have you?"

Isabella Sullivan shook her head. "No, I haven't."

Yesterday, Clara headed straight for the villa section. They never even looked at the high-rises.

"Let me tell you, the interiors are so luxurious! The range hoods, the water heaters, all name brands. The layout is very well designed too. I heard they hired a foreign designer for it... And the landscaping, you should see it. Fully sodded lawns, rubberized running tracks, basketball courts, badminton courts... they have everything."

Chloe Sullivan recounted it all proudly. "I'm not exaggerating, living here would add at least ten years to your life!"

Charles Sullivan's mouth twitched. "Is it really that amazing?"

"Of course it is! Didn't you just see it for yourself? The facts are right there. Would I lie?"

Charles Sullivan: "..."

He just felt they shouldn't be saying these things in front of his sister-in-law.

After all, his younger brother's family had lived in that old residential compound for decades and never moved. Wasn't this just rubbing salt in the wound?

But this was exactly the effect Chloe Sullivan wanted.

Her eyes shifted craftily. "I'm serious, sister-in-law. You've lived in that staff housing complex for over twenty years, right? Never thought about moving? Take my advice, buy a place in this development. We could be neighbors. Look out for each other."

"It's just the price..." Chloe Sullivan trailed off meaningfully. "It might be a bit over your budget. But it should be manageable. After all, Third Brother is a teacher at a key high school. He could always tutor students on the side for some extra cash. The money would come easily."

Isabella Sullivan frowned. "The Education Bureau strictly prohibits tutoring now. Lao Su always follows the rules. He would never do that."

Chloe Sullivan curled her lip.

Too stupid to make easy money!

"If Third Brother can't earn extra, there's still you! I hear writers can make millions just from the copyright for one book. You've been writing for so many years, sister-in-law. You must be doing quite well."

Isabella Sullivan gave an awkward smile.

If she could really make money from copyrights, she wouldn't have had to wait for her daughter to buy them a villa.

Sophia Sullivan noticed Isabella Sullivan's impatience and spoke up. "Uncle, Aunt, we have things to do, we should get going..."

"What's the hurry? It's the New Year holiday. What could you possibly have to do?" Chloe Sullivan's tone turned pointed. "Not to be harsh, Clara, but you're in your twenties now. Not studying, not working, no boyfriend. Look at you, still relying on your parents. What other girl your age is like that?"

She still remembered the incident with the cherries.

Finally catching this opportunity, Chloe Sullivan was determined to get even. "Not to compare too far, but just look at your eldest cousin. He's running a company in the capital now. His future is limitless."

"My Qianqian isn't that spectacular, but she got into the Power Bureau on her own merit. A secure, iron rice bowl."

"Sometimes I really worry for Third Brother and his wife. They worked so hard to raise their child, and she's accomplished nothing. Not bringing any glory to the family, can't even support herself, still leeching off her parents. It's just..."

Chloe Sullivan shook her head repeatedly, sighing with false concern.

Charles Sullivan was frantically signaling with his eyes, but she completely ignored him.

Isabella Sullivan's smile faded, her voice turning cool. "Yes, Qianqian is the most successful. She even got into the Power Bureau with just a college diploma."

Chloe Sullivan, either missing or ignoring the sarcasm, grew even more smug. "Of course! Our Qianqian has never given us a moment's worry since she was little. So well-behaved and sensible!"

"Her grandfather said he'll introduce her to someone within the system in a couple of years. She'll be an official's wife..."

Chloe Sullivan's voice rose. "As for me, I don't ask for much in this life. I have everything I need anyway. I just hope the whole family stays healthy and safe!"

"Why are you saying all this?" Charles Sullivan couldn't take it anymore. "Rambling on about nothing... Sister-in-law, I'm sorry. She has no filter. Please don't take it to heart."

Chloe Sullivan exploded at that. "Charles Sullivan, who do you think you are?! I can't even speak now? It's the truth! I'm not lying. What are you apologizing for?!"

Charles Sullivan looked utterly humiliated by her shouting.

But he didn't dare talk back.

His comfortable life was entirely due to his wife's family's influence. Chloe Sullivan's parents were both leaders in the Power Bureau. His current job was arranged by his father-in-law.

A third-party inspection company outsourced by the Power Bureau. He clocked in, lazed around, and still made over ten thousand a month.

His cushy life depended entirely on the Zhou family. And Chloe Sullivan was their only daughter. How could he afford to offend her?

Seeing him silent, Chloe Sullivan's anger flared hotter. "Say something! Weren't you full of words a moment ago? Cat got your tongue now?"

Charles Sullivan's face was dark.

Being berated by his wife like this in front of his sister-in-law and niece was a complete loss of face.

But Chloe Sullivan either didn't notice her husband's embarrassment or didn't care. She continued her tirade.

"Back in the day, I, Chloe Sullivan, was the belle of the bureau. How did I end up with—"

Just then, Gigi rushed out from the reception room—

"Miss Laurent! Thank goodness you're still here! You gave me a scare."

Sophia Sullivan asked, "Is there something else?"

"My mistake. I gave you the wrong contract. You should keep the original copy of the 'Purchase Agreement'. We keep the photocopy. I messed up in all the rush earlier. Could you please check if this original is correct..."
###Chapter 83
Sophia Sullivan handed over the document.

Chloe Sullivan checked it carefully and sighed with relief. "I'm so sorry. This is my first time handling a villa transaction. I'm still unfamiliar with many procedures."

"It's fine."

Chloe Sullivan Sullivan stood nearby. She heard every word clearly but couldn't comprehend them.

"What contract is this?" she asked, pointing at the document.

"The purchase agreement."

"Whose?"

"Miss Sullivan is buying the house."

Chloe Sullivan staggered back a step. "She's buying a house? Here?"

"Of course."

"Impossible!" Chloe Sullivan's voice rose sharply. "Which unit is she buying? How big?"

"Ma'am, Miss Sullivan is purchasing a villa."

"A villa?!" Chloe Sullivan's voice nearly cracked. "Lakeside Pearl? How is that possible!"

Sophia sighed softly. "Aunt Chloe Sullivan, it's true I'm not very accomplished. I can only show my filial piety by buying my parents a villa. I hope they can live comfortably. You won't have to worry about their living situation anymore."

Chloe Sullivan's face turned ashen.

"We need to go decorate the new house. We won't disturb you and Uncle Charles while you view properties." Isabella Sullivan smiled and nodded.

Just then, a sales agent hurried over. "Weren't you just going to the restroom? How did you end up in the VIP room?"

Charles Sullivan quickly apologized. "Sorry, we didn't know..."

"Have you decided yet? Whose name will be on the deed? Leo Wilson or Ruby Thompson? They need to be present with their IDs to sign."

The agent's tone was impatient.

Sophia and Isabella exchanged a glance.

Leo Wilson? Ruby Thompson?

Weren't those Chloe Sullivan's parents' names?

"So you're buying a house for your parents?" Isabella asked lightly. "The environment here is indeed suitable for retirement."

"No!" Chloe Sullivan denied urgently. "It's just under my parents' names temporarily! We're the ones who will actually live there!"

"Wouldn't it be simpler to just put your own names on it?"

The agent also advised, "Yes, if you're the ones living there, it's better to use your own names."

"I'm only holding this unit for you because Grace and I are classmates. If you wait until tomorrow, it might be sold to someone else."

Chloe Sullivan panicked immediately. "We want to buy it! We'll take it now!"

"Then please provide your IDs. We can sign immediately."

"Can we wait until tomorrow? I promise I'll come tomorrow!"

The agent's expression cooled. "It might be gone by tomorrow."

Chloe Sullivan gritted her teeth. "Let me make a call first."

She walked to a corner, making sure the Sullivan mother and daughter couldn't hear, and dialed. "Dad, I'm at Lakeside Pearl... The environment is excellent... Yes, very popular! You need to come sign the contract today..."

Chloe Sullivan's scheme was clever.

Have her parents buy the new house first, then convince them to live in her current home. After all, she was their only daughter. The property would be hers eventually.

As for the name on the deed, put it under her parents first. Transfer it to her after full payment to save on taxes.

"...Hurry up and take a taxi here. It's near the second high school..."

Sophia and Isabella had already left.

David Sullivan called. "Why aren't you here yet? The front and backyard designs are amazing! We can plant flowers, vegetables, even fruit trees..."

Hearing her husband's excited voice, Isabella couldn't wait to see their new home.

"We were delayed by something. We're on our way now."

...

Chloe Sullivan watched her parents sign the contract and complete the payment. She personally saw them off before leaving.

In the car, Chloe Sullivan leaned back and let out a long breath. "Finally settled."

"Why are you so eager about our parents buying a house? Did they really have to come today?"

"What do you know? Good houses sell fast! As for why I'm so eager..." A smile played on Chloe Sullivan's lips. "Do you want to live here or not?"

Charles frowned. "Of course, but we can't afford it."

"I want to live here. My parents' house will be mine eventually. What's wrong with enjoying it sooner?"

"Mom and Dad won't agree."

"Don't worry, I have a plan..."

Such an expensive house would empty the savings of even wealthy families, let alone a villa.

Where did Sophia get that much money?
###Chapter 84

The whole family knew.

Chloe Sullivan felt a sour jealousy in her heart.

Among the three Sullivan brothers, the eldest was the most successful.

That was undeniable.

He was a big boss and had long since left them behind.

Her family was next.

Charles Sullivan wasn't the best, but he was better than the worst.

Thanks to his in-laws' connections, he became manager at an inspection company.

His job was easy, with an annual salary of three hundred thousand.

She herself had a secure job at the power bureau.

Their daughter, Grace, also worked at the power bureau.

They could be considered a comfortable, well-off family.

The worst off was the third brother's family.

So what if he got into a top university?

He ended up back here as a poor teacher.

Stubborn, no idea how to make extra money.

Isabella was even worse.

A so-called full-time writer, but really just unemployed.

All these years, she never produced any masterpiece.

How many books has she published? Sold any rights?

Not even a book signing.

What kind of writer is that?

More like a professional sitter!

It was fine when things were like this.

But the third brother's family suddenly moved into a villa?!

And in the best development in the neighboring city.

Her parents spent their life savings just to afford a regular high-rise apartment.

The smallest unit at that.

How did the third brother's family manage it?

"Charles, what has your third brother been up to lately? Anything unusual?"

"How should I know?"

"Aren't you his second brother?"

"Our families don't usually interact. Weren't you the one who told me to keep my distance?"

Chloe Sullivan had no retort.

She really didn't like associating with the third brother's family.

Who wants to hang out with people worse off than themselves?

She was afraid Isabella would ask to borrow money!

Charles asked, "Why are you suddenly asking about this?"

"The third brother's family quietly bought a villa. Don't you think that's strange?"

Charles fell silent.

Of course it was strange.

Like a beggar suddenly becoming wealthy.

Who wouldn't be curious about the reason?

"His wife said it was Sophia who bought it…"

"Ha! How would Sophia Sullivan get that kind of money? Selling herself?"

"What nonsense are you talking?!"

Wait…

Money from selling herself.

Why hadn't she thought of that?

Chloe Sullivan's eyes lit up.

Her face showed disdain and disgust, but underneath lay jealousy and resentment.

She took out her phone and dialed.

"Hello, Victoria? Are you busy?"

"Something up, second sister-in-law?"

"I went to look at apartments at Lakeside Pearl today. Guess who I saw?"

Victoria Sullivan wasn't very interested. "Who?"

"Your third sister-in-law and Sophia!"

"They were at the sales office?"

"Not just that. They bought a villa!"

"…What?" Victoria thought she misheard.

She never imagined a villa could be connected to her third brother's family.

"Are you sure it was her? Not the eldest brother and his wife?"

Chloe Sullivan's mouth twitched. "I'm not so old and blind that I'd mistake someone."

Besides…

The difference between Sophia Sullivan and Isabella was too big to confuse.

Victoria swallowed. "They bought a villa? You're not mistaken?"

"I saw the sales contract myself. How could it be fake?"

"How is that possible?!"

Chloe Sullivan sighed. "I had the same reaction at first. But who made the third brother's daughter so capable? Gone for years, made a fortune, comes home and buys her parents a villa. We can only envy that…"

Victoria seized the key point. "You said Sophia bought it?"

"Yes, that child is really something! Not like our Grace, only able to get a dead-end job at the power bureau…"

"How does a young girl get that much money?"

Chloe Sullivan covered her mouth, smiling meaningfully. "How would I know? But you said it yourself, she's a young girl. Young girls these days have great skills. Designer clothes, luxury bags… can't afford them themselves, but that doesn't mean no one will give them…"

Victoria frowned deeply.

"Oh my, listen to me run off at the mouth. I shouldn't say things I shouldn't. Well, you must be busy. I'll hang up now."

Chloe Sullivan knew when to stop.

Victoria held the ended call, lost in thought.

Right after hanging up on Victoria, Chloe Sullivan called the eldest sister-in-law, Sophia Sullivan.

"Eldest sister-in-law, it's Chloe Sullivan…"

"Perfect timing. A client sent some cigarettes, alcohol, and local specialties for the New Year. I divided them into two portions, one for your family and one for the third brother's. Come get them when you have time."

In previous years, Sophia Sullivan would give some things to Chloe Sullivan.

This was the first year she included the third brother's family.

Chloe Sullivan's heart sank, sour like pickles.

"Why is there a portion for the third brother this year?"

Sophia said, "In previous years, there wasn't much, so I only gave to you. This year there's extra."

Chloe Sullivan thought, no matter how much, I could take it all.

"Sigh, eldest sister-in-law always thinks of us. I'm naturally very grateful. But the third brother's family… I'm afraid they might look down on these things."

"Look down on them?" Sophia frowned.

"Of course. They're wealthy people about to live in a Lakeside villa. What good cigarettes, alcohol, or local specialties don't they have?"

"Lakeside villa?" Sophia had naturally heard of this development.

Not only heard of it but had been in contact.

Her son was of marriageable age, and she was preparing a wedding home.

Ryan Sullivan was handsome and had started his own company.

He would marry a girl from a family of equal status.

The wedding home couldn't be casual.

It needed to be comfortable with convenient transportation, but also consider the community environment and social connections.

Best if it was an area where wealthy people gathered.

After looking around, she settled on Lakeside Pearl.

A high-rise wouldn't do; it had to be a villa.

She went to the sales office twice.

The first time to prepare the funds verification fee.

The second time to formally view the property.

She was very satisfied with the villa.

The structure and design were top-notch in the neighboring city.

But the price…

The cheapest started at four million.

A mortgage was out of the question; it would make the女方's family look down on them.

Besides, who gets a mortgage for a villa? It's always paid in full.

She discussed it with William Sullivan, but he hesitated.

"…Although life is better now than before, in the building materials industry, you know, developers often delay payments. Last year alone, nearly two million in receivables weren't collected. The company's cash flow is tight. We really can't spare four million for a villa."

"Don't worry, we'll definitely buy a wedding home for our son. But there's no hurry. He doesn't even have a girlfriend yet. It's too early to think about this."

Sophia paused while ironing clothes. "But that development is very popular. If we don't buy now, we might not get the chance later."
###Chapter 85

Fainting wasn't the end of the world.
Once the accounts receivable were collected and funds were more fluid, they could just buy it back from someone else at a slightly higher price.

Sophia Sullivan's lips parted.
She wanted to ask who would buy a second-hand property for a marital home?
But her husband had already laid out the situation. The company was genuinely struggling right now. She had to let it go.

Yet, the lakeside villa became her fixation.
Not buying it felt unacceptable.
Buying it was financially impossible.

"Are you sure it's the Lakeside Pearl villa?" Sophia Sullivan confirmed once more over the phone.

A smirk touched Chloe Sullivan's lips.
See? No one could believe it.
The useless third brother's family had actually bought a villa.

"The purchase contract was black and white. I saw it with my own eyes. It can't be fake. Isabella Sullivan admitted it herself, said it was a gift from Clara. Sigh, why don't I have such a capable daughter?"

"Don't underestimate Clara just because she's a girl. She's far more successful than Ryan now."

Ryan Sullivan had started a company, but he hadn't gifted his parents a villa.

Sophia Sullivan's voice cooled slightly. "Clara is filial, but where did she get that kind of money?"

"That, I don't know. But don't underestimate young women these days, sister-in-law."

Sophia Sullivan didn't pursue the villa topic. "When are you free to come get your things?"

"Tomorrow. I'll have Charles drive over to pick them up."

"Alright."

The call ended. Chloe Sullivan put her phone away.

Charles Sullivan frowned. "Why are you spreading this everywhere? Afraid people won't know the third brother bought a villa?"

This wasn't like Chloe Sullivan.

"What 'other people'? We're all Sullivans. Who counts as 'other people'? The third brother buying a villa is cause for celebration!"

"What are you really up to?" Charles Sullivan knew his wife too well.

Chloe Sullivan snorted lightly. "Informing everyone so they can all congratulate the third brother. Is that wrong?"

"You definitely have another motive."

Chloe Sullivan pushed him, chuckling. "Didn't realize you knew me so well…"

"Hey! I'm driving!"

"If I do have another motive… it's just a small one. If I asked the third brother or Isabella Sullivan directly, they'd never reveal the source of the money. So let others ask."

She didn't believe they could withstand the pressure.
Even if the truth wasn't uncovered, the constant pestering would be a nuisance.
She wouldn't be the only one green with envy. She'd drag everyone into the spectacle.

Charles Sullivan was skeptical. "Cecilia avoids drama. Sister-in-law stays out of everything. Your plan is flawed."

Chloe Sullivan pursed her lips. "That just shows you don't understand sister-in-law or your own sister."

Victoria Sullivan avoided drama, preferring to tend her own garden.
The divorce had hit her hard. She often spouted motivational quotes about "female independence," "self-reliance," and "strong character."
She not only motivated herself but also loved lecturing others.
She particularly despised women who relied on men, became mistresses, or were gold diggers.

As for Sophia Sullivan…
A contemptuous smile curled Chloe Sullivan's lip.
A benevolent Bodhisattva when things were fine, but touch a nerve, and even a quiet dog will bite.

"Just wait. The third brother's family is in for some busy times!"

...

"Cecilia? What brings you here? This is a surprise! Please, come in—"

The day after Chloe Sullivan's call, while David Sullivan and Isabella Sullivan were packing at home, Victoria Sullivan paid a visit.

David Sullivan's surprise was understandable.
This sister had high standards, high demands, and a cold, proud demeanor.
Aside from holiday meals at the eldest brother's house, she rarely interacted with the second and third brother's families.

Victoria Sullivan changed her slippers and scanned the living room.
Noting several sealed cardboard boxes in the corner, she calmly took a seat on the sofa.

"Third Brother, Third Sister-in-law, are you… doing a deep clean?"

Isabella Sullivan smiled. "Just packing some bedsheets, duvet covers, and clothes."

"All packed?" Her gaze fell on the boxes.

"Pretty much."

"Planning to move?"

"Yes."

"Where to?"

David Sullivan and Isabella Sullivan exchanged a glance. There seemed little point in hiding it.
It couldn't be hidden forever. People would find out eventually.

David Sullivan: "The new development nearby. Lakeside Pearl."

"You bought a high-rise unit?"

"No," David Sullivan shook his head. "It's a villa."

Perfectly feigned surprise appeared on Victoria Sullivan's face, as if she were just hearing the news. "Third Brother, where did you get that kind of money? The cheapest villa at Lakeside Pearl is three to four million. You…"

She paused, concern welling in her eyes. "You can't be involved in anything illegal."

"No, no, I wouldn't dare!" David Sullivan was amused and exasperated.

"Then the money…"

"It was Clara—"

"Dad!" Sophia Sullivan suddenly entered from the balcony, cutting off David Sullivan. "You're just talking about yourself. Didn't you ask Auntie why she came over so suddenly?"

"Right, Cecilia, what brings you here?"

She never visited out of the blue. There must be a reason.

Uh!

Victoria Sullivan was taken aback.
She hadn't expected Sophia Sullivan to interject, immediately putting her on the spot.

"I… I was entertaining a client nearby. Thought since I was close, I'd drop by."

"I see… I heard Auntie was just promoted to branch manager. You must be very busy."

Victoria Sullivan forced a smile. "Snatching a moment of leisure… By the way, Clara, it was so crowded and chaotic at your uncle's last time. We didn't get a chance to talk."

Sophia Sullivan raised an eyebrow, a hint of surprise in her expression. "What did you want to talk to me about, Auntie?"

"Now that you're back, will you be leaving again after the New Year?"

"Barring any surprises, I'll be returning to Kyoto."

"And what are you doing there now…? Working? Studying? Or something else?"

Sophia Sullivan was silent for a moment. "...Let's say I'm exploring new opportunities."

Once her postgraduate exam results came out, she could say she was going to study.
But she hadn't received an acceptance letter yet. Everything was still uncertain.
No matter how confident Sophia Sullivan was, she wouldn't speak carelessly.
She could only give an ambiguous answer.

To Victoria Sullivan's ears, however, it sounded like "unemployed," "looking for a new sugar daddy"!

Her heart sank. She beckoned to Sophia Sullivan. "Come, Clara, sit here. Let's have a chat."

Sophia Sullivan, baffled, still went over and sat beside her.

"Clara, do you know what is most important for us women?"

"?"

"The ability to be self-reliant and independent. The spirit of relentless self-improvement. The passion to strive and fight."

"??"

"Take me, for example. My fate hasn't been easy. Our family was poor when I was young, so I studied desperately and got into a decent university."

"After graduation, I couldn't find a good job. But I started from the bottom as a contract bank teller, did all the dirty, tiring work for low pay. Now, haven't I gotten a permanent position and become a branch manager?"

"Then there's marriage. I thought I'd married a good man, but he turned out to be scum. But I cut my losses in time, chose divorce, and live alone. Aren't I doing just fine now?"

Uh!

"So, Auntie, what exactly are you trying to say?"
###Chapter 86

Her face burned with humiliation.

Victoria Sullivan spoke with grave sincerity.

She looked at Sophia.

"A woman must never take shortcuts, no matter how difficult things get."

"Be down-to-earth."

"Steady and solid progress is the right path."

"Stay away from crooked methods."

"Avoid wishful thinking at all costs."

Sophia nodded gently.

"That's true."

"You agree?" Victoria looked pleased.

"Of course."

"Then I'm relieved." She sighed. "Return the villa as soon as possible."

"You might lose the handling fee."

"But peace of mind is worth it."

Sophia raised an eyebrow.

"Having second thoughts?" Victoria's expression darkened.

Sophia suddenly laughed.

So that's what this was about.

"First, I agree with everything you said, Aunt Victoria."

"Women should rely on themselves."

"But I haven't relied on anyone else."

"Consider your words shared experience."

"I won't take them personally."

Her tone was calm.

"Besides, the villa was bought for my parents to live in."

"The contract is already signed."

"It can't be returned."

"Finally, I suggest you know your boundaries."

"You can offer advice."

"But don't issue commands."

Sophia finished speaking.

Victoria's face was stormy.

She left in a huff.

Tossing a final remark over her shoulder.

"Sharp tongue!"

"Unyielding and unrepentant!"

David Sullivan frowned deeply.

Isabella spoke directly.

"Ignore her."

"Coming here to lecture without knowing the full story."

Sophia didn't take it to heart.

She worried others might show up too.

But the following week was peaceful.

No further disturbances.

The move proceeded gradually.

David was reluctant to part with his plants.

The potted plants were easy to move.

Transplanting the trees in the yard took time.

Isabella only cared about her books.

Two entire bookcases needed moving.

They finished by Lantern Festival.

The lush greenery gave the villa a classical charm.

A new vegetable plot was dug in the backyard.

The amaranth seeds had already sprouted.

They'd be ready to eat in half a month.

The swing and lounge chairs were brought over.

The wisteria was transplanted to the new home.

Everywhere felt familiar.

The front and back yards were still bare.

Come spring, they would be covered in lawn.

Blossoms would fill the garden.

Thinking of this, Sophia didn't feel tired anymore.

An amusing incident occurred during the move.

Their neighbor, Linda Moore, saw them moving things.

She assumed David was moving away.

She envisioned claiming the empty space between their houses.

Even annexing part of the yard.

For growing vegetables, raising chickens and fish.

Enough to feed the whole family.

She stood at her gate, arms crossed.

"Moving out?"

David ignored her.

Focused on digging.

Isabella heard the voice and retreated indoors.

Out of sight, out of mind.

Linda smirked.

"What's there to be proud of?"

"Driven out by me, after all…"

She went to the market for groceries.

Ran into an old friend.

"Buying eggs?"

"They're half price at this hour."

Linda was very proud.

She was excellent at managing household expenses.

"I'll come at this time next time."

"I heard Professor Sullivan is moving away?"

Linda nodded.

"Who knows where he's renting."

"Could it be as convenient as here?"

A man his age still clinging to pride.

Couldn't take it, so he leaves.

Saves her the trouble of cutting those vines.

Her friend lowered her voice.

"Is he moving because of that argument?"

Linda lifted her chin.

"How should I know?"

"Some people are petty sore losers."

"I'll just grow vegetables in the yard later."

"That's exactly what I thought!" Linda's eyes gleamed.

Another neighbor hurried past.

"Hurry and get the candy!"

"It'll be gone soon."

Linda was stunned.

"What candy?"

"The Sullivans' housewarming candy."

"You're their neighbor, you must have gotten some already?"

"I need to hurry."

Linda pressed.

"Why are they giving out candy?"

"It's not a wedding."

"It's for their new house!"

"A huge villa!"

"Giving neighbors celebratory candy."

Linda's eyes widened.

"Villa?!"

"Rented?"

"Bought!"

"Lakeside Pearl!"

Linda gasped.

"How is that possible?"

"My husband drove over with flowers to see it."

"Spacious and beautiful."

"Two yards, front and back."

"So comfortable."

"Enough talk, I'm going to get candy."

"Share in the joy."

Laughter faded into the distance.

Linda stood frozen.

Unable to move.

Her face burned.

After a busy week, they finally settled into the new home.

David cooked a full table of dishes.

Isabella raised her glass.

"To a new home and new beginnings."

"May everything go smoothly."

Glasses clinked.

A clear, crisp sound.

Laughter spread through the garden.

The moonlight was perfect.

Light in the darkness.

Early the next morning after moving in.

David received a call from the elderly lady.

"Mom?"

"I heard you moved to a new house?"

"Yes."

"Custom dictates a housewarming."

"Tomorrow is Lantern Festival."

"Usually we celebrate at your eldest brother's."

"Shall we come to your place this year?"
###Chapter 87

David Sullivan held his phone. "Then I should ask Isabella first..."

"Ask what?" The old woman's tone turned icy. "A grown man like you can't make a simple decision?"

"Mom, it's about respect..."

"Useless! Go ahead and ask. It's best if she agrees, but it doesn't matter if she doesn't. Your father and I are coming tomorrow!"

The call ended abruptly with a sharp click.

David sighed helplessly.

Isabella walked in from the garden. "Who was that?"

"...Mom."

"What did she want?"

"She said they're coming for the Lantern Festival tomorrow. To warm the new house."

Isabella nodded. "Good. Let's invite William and Sophia, Charles and Chloe Sullivan, and Victoria too."

...

Early the next morning, Isabella went to the market to shop.

By four in the afternoon, relatives began to arrive.

Chloe Sullivan Sullivan entered and immediately started looking around, her expression growing more sour by the second.

She had known the third brother lived in a villa, but seeing it in person was jarring.

She was uncharacteristically quiet.

Charles Sullivan nudged her. Chloe Sullivan finally spoke with effort. "Congratulations, third brother, sister-in-law."

Grace Sullivan followed behind, her eyes shining. "Auntie, can I take a look around?"

"Feel free."

She wandered the living room twice, then vanished in the blink of an eye.

William Sullivan was busy with work and couldn't make it, but Sophia arrived.

She pressed a thick red envelope into Isabella's hand, all smiles. "This villa is beautiful. Congratulations."

Isabella tried to refuse but eventually had to accept.

"Thank you, sister-in-law."

"Don't be so formal with family."

The old man and woman came with Sophia. They immediately took the main sofa and scrutinized the interior.

They exchanged a look, shock evident in both their eyes.

This villa was too luxurious!

Far superior to their townhouse!

The original decor was good, but Sophia Sullivan had added many details.

Wall art, cabinet ornaments, rugs, and curtains—all carefully chosen.

Every detail was exquisite.

"David, this house must have cost a fortune?" George Sullivan, the old man, spoke.

David didn't want to boast. "The soft furnishings were all bought online by Isabella and Sophia. Not expensive, didn't cost much..."

"Really? You didn't spend much, yet you bought a villa?" Chloe Sullivan interjected with a laugh, her usual sharpness returning now that the initial sting had passed. "Dad, this place must be at least four or five million. Shocking, right? Charles and I could never earn that in a lifetime."

Victoria Sullivan had been cold-faced since entering. She snorted. "Third brother has a good daughter. No one else can compare."

"Yes," Chloe Sullivan picked up, "Sophia is beautiful, filial, and knows how to make money. What other daughter has that skill? Our Grace could never learn it."

Her tone was barbed,praise but actually dripping with sarcasm.

Sophia's eyes flickered. "I still don't know what Sophia does in Kyoto? It must be impressive? Ordinary people can't make millions."

Sophia Sullivan frowned. Isabella pressed her hand, signaling she would handle it.

"Sister-in-law, you flatter her. Sophia changed jobs a few times after graduation, saved a little money."

Victoria sneered. "It's good if she really saved it herself. I just worry a girl might take the wrong path."

Isabella's expression remained neutral. "Thank you for your concern. The child has her own plans. We just support her."

Chloe Sullivan raised an eyebrow. "Plans? So sister-in-law means Sophia has next steps? Returning to work in Kyoto? Or finding a new... target? Will she bring back another few million next New Year?"

She emphasized the word "target" deliberately.

The implication was clear.

Isabella's face darkened. She was about to speak when Sophia's phone rang.

"Mom, I need to take this..."

"Go ahead." Isabella took a deep breath, suppressing her anger.

"Olivia, what's wrong?"

Olivia Lopez sounded urgent. "The postgraduate exam results are out! Check your score!"

Sophia calculated the time. It was indeed today!

She had completely forgotten...

"Okay, checking now." She hung up and headed upstairs.

Back in her bedroom, she opened her laptop, went to the results page, entered her exam ID and password. Her finger hovered over the enter key—

"Sophia, are these bags real?"

A voice came from the walk-in closet.

Sophia was startled. She saw Grace Sullivan holding a Chanel bag, a Louis Vuitton monogram bag slung over her shoulder.

"Who said you could come in here?"

Grace was taken aback. "Auntie said I could look around."

"Looking around doesn't mean rummaging through my things."

"Sophia, what's your problem? They're just bags. Can't I even look? Are they that precious?"

Sophia's face turned cold. "Didn't anyone teach you not to touch other people's things?"

"What if I did? I can't touch them?"

"No."

"Whatever. I touched them today, so what? Weren't they bought for you by some man? Stop pretending to be so pure! Let's be real, you're just used goods!"

"Worn by one today, trampled by another tomorrow. You're already spoiled!"

Slap—

Sophia's hand shot out, striking Grace across the face.

"This slap is to teach you to watch your mouth."

"...You dare hit me?!" Grace covered her cheek, eyes wide, trembling all over.

"I hit you because I want to. Do I need to pick a day?"

"Sophia—I'll fight you!"

...

Downstairs, everyone was still subtly probing how Sophia made her money.

The old man and woman were also testing the waters.

Suddenly, a scream came from the second floor.

Chloe Sullivan's face changed dramatically. She shot to her feet. "That's Grace! Grace is screaming!"
###Chapter 88
A group of people rushed upstairs.

The noise came from Sophia Sullivan's bedroom.

The door was ajar.

Grace Sullivan was sitting on the floor.

Two handbags were scattered nearby.

She was wailing loudly.

Her legs kicked out wildly.

She looked like a hysterical madwoman.

"Grace!" Chloe Sullivan Sullivan rushed over and crouched down. "Don't scare me, get up..."

"No! I won't get up until Sophia apologizes!"

Sophia crossed her arms and smirked. "Then stay sitting. Or lie down, if you prefer."

"You—"

Chloe Sullivan's eyes turned sharp. "Apologize for what? What exactly happened?"

"Mom! She hit me!"

Chloe Sullivan whipped her head around. "How could you hit her?"

"Aunt Chloe Sullivan, I heard noises from the walk-in closet when I returned to my room. I thought it was a burglar. But I am curious, why was Grace in my room? And why did it sound like she was rummaging through things?"

Her gaze swept over the two bags on the floor.

Chloe Sullivan's expression shifted. "Your cousin was just curious, looking around... But you still shouldn't have hit her!"

"I didn't know it was Grace when I swung. What normal person rummages through someone else's closets?"

Chloe Sullivan shot her daughter a fierce glare.

Grace guiltily looked away.

Isabella Sullivan smiled, trying to smooth things over. "It's just a misunderstanding. Let's all go downstairs for dinner?"

A phone suddenly rang.

David Sullivan was closest.

Sophia said, "Dad, could you grab that for me?"

He picked up the phone.

He accidentally hit the answer button.

And the speakerphone too.

Olivia Lopez's clear voice came through—

"Sophia, did you check your score? What is it? Did you get into MIT?"

The room fell silent.

"Sophia? Why aren't you talking? Can you hear me?"

Sophia took the phone. "Something came up just now. I was about to check."

"Forget that! Check your score now!"

"Okay."

The call ended.

Everyone stared at Sophia.

Even Grace on the floor forgot to cry.

David swallowed hard. "Sophia, check what score?"

"My postgrad entrance exam results."

"You took the postgrad exam?!" Isabella exclaimed in surprise.

"Yes."

Chloe Sullivan raised an eyebrow. "You're still taking postgrad exams at your age?"

"Aunt Chloe Sullivan, plenty of people in their forties take them. I'm not that old, am I?"

"Why the sudden decision to take the exam?"

"Just for fun."

Chloe Sullivan was speechless.

"The results came out today?" Sophia Sullivan  glanced at the notebook on the table. "Sophia was going to check, but then Grace... Well, the misunderstanding is cleared up. Grace, get up now."

Grace's eyes darted.

She had no ground to stand on if she kept making a scene.

She took the opportunity to stand up.

"Since we're checking scores, let's all have a look. My cousin is so amazing, she must have done well."

As if postgrad exams were easy.

MIT, no less?

Did Sophia really think she was still the top student from years ago?

Trying to go back to school after all this time?

Dream on!

Once the scores came out, they'd see how humiliated she'd be!

Sophia  said, "I'm curious too."

Victoria Sullivan smirked. "Yes, check it? It doesn't matter if the score is good or bad."

Isabella wanted to refuse.

But Sophia smiled. "Sure."

Everyone crowded around the computer.

Sophia had already entered her exam ID and password.

All that was left was to hit enter.

"Dad, you press it."

David pointed at himself. "Me?"

"Yes, you checked my college entrance exam scores all those years ago too."

"Alright." He rubbed his hands together, took a deep breath, and pressed enter.

The page refreshed.

Loading.

The entire room held its breath.

One second.

Two seconds.

"It's out!"

Total score: 412.

Chloe Sullivan tugged on her dazed daughter. "What's the total score? Is 400 something high?"

Grace's lips moved, but no sound came out.

"Why aren't you saying anything?"

Sophia hid the surprise, smiled: "The total is 500. With this score, Sophia should rank in the top three. Possibly first."

Chloe Sullivan's eyes widened. "She got into MIT?!"

Victoria said expressionlessly, "Postgrad admissions have a written exam and an interview. Just the written score leaves a lot of variables."

Chloe Sullivan breathed a sigh of relief.

She knew Sophia couldn't possibly get into MIT.

Top three?

Sophia smiled: "The written exam carries significant weight, and the interview doesn't eliminate many. Sophia is practically halfway into MIT already. Congratulations, David, Isabella."

David was still in a daze.

His daughter, who hadn't come home for six years, was not only back.

She'd gifted them a villa.

And now she was accepted into a postgrad program?

Their estrangement years ago was precisely over this.

He believed she shouldn't waste her talent.

Pursuing a Master's and PhD was the natural path.

But she gave up a combined program for a man.

It was a huge blow to the old father.

Now, everything was perfect...

"Thank you, Sophia."

Sophia : "Sophia is now the most highly educated among the younger generation of the Sullivans."

Grace's face darkened.

Chloe Sullivan pressed her lips together tightly.

Victoria said, "Let's wait until she actually receives the acceptance letter."

The dinner was unusually quiet.

Everyone was lost in their own thoughts.

They left in a hurry after eating.

...

January 20th.

Isabella's birthday.

The recent rain and snow had finally cleared.

Tender shoots emerged from the grass.

The yard was full of life again.

Isabella didn't care for sweets.

No cake was ordered.

Sophia bought flour.

She planned to make longevity noodles by hand.

The gift had been chosen long ago.

A set of out-of-print original language books.

She had searched for a long time.

Finally found them on an obscure foreign website.

It took half a month for them to ship back.
###Chapter 89

The out-of-print original edition books arrived the day before her birthday.

Isabella Sullivan held the books with delighted surprise. "How did you know I was looking for these?"

"You've mentioned them many times." Sophia Sullivan raised an eyebrow. "It was hard to forget."

Isabella humphed lightly. "You're the one who stayed away for so long... but thank you, my dear."

She reached out to embrace Sophia, her fingers gently brushing through her short hair. "Didn't you used to have long hair?"

Sophia leaned against her shoulder. "Does short hair not look good?"

"It looks wonderful! My daughter always looks beautiful!" Isabella's tone was full of pride.

Sophia pressed her lips together in a slight smile, nestling closer.

"You passed the written exam, so you should prepare for the interview now, right?" Isabella asked softly. "Do you need to return to Kyoto?"

Sophia gave a slight nod.

Isabella smiled. "I always knew this city couldn't keep you. Go, do what you want to do."

Sophia's eyelashes fluttered slightly. "I won't let you down this time."

The sound of a spatula came from the kitchen. David Sullivan poked his head out and called, "What are you whispering about? Come wash your hands for dinner!"

"Coming!"

Early the next morning, Sophia boarded the high-speed train back to Kyoto.

After half a month away, a thin layer of dust covered the apartment.

She first checked the fish tank. Little Red and Little Black were swimming actively. She sprinkled fish food and smiled with relief.

The succulents on the balcony were still thriving, as if they had never lacked water.

She turned on the floor heating and began a deep clean. She put on fresh bedsheets and a fluffy pink sofa cover.

The soft texture lifted her spirits.

By the time she finished cleaning, it was already evening.

Too lazy to buy groceries, she ordered fresh produce delivery. Under the warm light, she leisurely prepared dinner.

Night deepened, and streetlights gradually lit up.

Alexander Laurent returned to the apartment building after finishing his experiments. His steps suddenly paused.

The window on the seventh floor, which had been dark for so long, was now emitting a warm glow.

He quickened his pace upstairs.

Light panting echoed in the stairwell when the door across from his suddenly opened.

Light spilled out, illuminating Sophia's surprised face.

Her eyes lit up, curving into crescents. "Good evening, Professor Laurent."

The corners of Alexander's lips lifted slightly. "Good evening. When did you return?"

"Today." Sophia looked slightly curious. "How did you know I was away?"

Alexander said, "Olivia mentioned you went back to your hometown. I haven't congratulated you yet on your excellent written exam results."

"Thank you." Sophia naturally invited, "I made dinner. Would you like to join me?"

The man waved his hand. "I've already eaten. Next time. We'll celebrate after you pass the interview."

Sophia raised an eyebrow. "So sure I'll pass? What if I fail?"

She wasn't even completely confident herself.

Amusement sparkled in Alexander's eyes. "You said 'what if.' I believe in probability."

Sophia's lips curved upward. "I'll take that as a good omen."

...

MIT's interview was scheduled for early March.

Sophia chose a formal suit with black low-heeled shoes.

Conservative and safe.

Before leaving, she selected an orange and green patterned silk scarf to wear.

The dull suit instantly gained a highlight.

It had rained the previous night. The ground was damp, and the air felt stifling.

The waiting room was crowded. Some people sighed nervously, while others fidgeted restlessly.

Sophia remained calm.

A girl behind her tapped her shoulder. "Classmate, aren't you nervous?"

Sophia replied calmly, "Not really."

She never crammed at the last minute. She had prepared for this day for too long. Now, she only felt the excitement of heading to the battlefield.

"Number 45, Sophia Sullivan—"

"Here."

She adjusted her collar and followed the staff to the interview classroom.

The moment she pushed the door open, she froze.

Alexander Laurent was sitting among the interview panel!

The man wore a gray suit. His gaze behind gold-rimmed glasses was sharp, appearing more serious than usual.

But when he looked up at her, his eyes remained gentle.

Sophia immediately felt reassured.

The interview began formally.

The examiners tossed out several professional questions, all of which she handled with ease.

Seeing her fluent responses, the examiners intentionally raised questions beyond the standard scope.

Sophia still performed excellently.

"Professor Laurent, it's your turn."

"Alright." Alexander looked up, a sudden sharpness in his gaze. "The bioinformatics you applied for is an interdisciplinary field. It involves biology, mathematics, and information science, requiring extremely high comprehensive ability from researchers. It will touch upon physics, chemistry, computer science, and other areas. Understood?"

"Understood." Sophia nodded.

"My next questions won't be limited to biology. They may require on-the-spot calculations. Can you accept that?"

Sophia said calmly, "I can try."

"Explain the physics of quasi-crystals with data support."

He actually asked in English.

This version of Alexander Laurent was full of academic aggression.

Sophia fell into deep thought—

Explain the physics of quasi-crystals with data support.

No context, no parameters. This wasn't even a biology question!

It seemed like he wanted a popular science essay.

The question not only stumped Sophia but also made the other interviewers exchange glances—

"Is this considered a biology question?"
###Chapter 90

"Yes, but not entirely."

"What is a quasicrystal?"

"A quasicrystal is a unique structure. Its atomic arrangement lacks periodic symmetry, existing between crystals and non-crystals. It was discovered by Daniel Shechtman, who won the 2011 Nobel Prize for this work."

"Wait... Nobel Prize in what?"

"Chemistry."

"Aren't we interviewing for the biology graduate program today?"

Why the sudden shift to physical chemistry?

"Professor Laurent mentioned the questions wouldn't be limited to biology."

"This is too difficult for an undergraduate."

"She was doing well earlier. Pity Professor Laurent singled her out…"

"Difficult?" Alexander Laurent spoke calmly. "You may choose to forfeit."

Sophia looked up. "Do you have a whiteboard and a marker?"

The key to this question was data support.

It tested interdisciplinary ability.

"Yes." Alexander signaled a staff member to prepare one.

A whiteboard was quickly brought in.

A marker was handed to her.

Sophia turned and wrote chemical formulas.

She started from the formulas, analyzing the atomic structure of quasicrystals.

It involved the icosahedron principle and the golden mean principle.

These two principles could explain the simplest quasicrystal structure model.

The model perfectly matched the high-resolution image details of the Al-Mn quasicrystal.

This fell under chemistry.

Then she moved into fractal geometry.

She derived pattern sequences.

Calculated correlation measures and correlation dimensions.

She discussed second-order, third-order, and k-th order sequences in detail.

This fell under mathematics.

The first whiteboard was filled with English and numbers.

She moved to the second one.

Now she entered the physics domain.

It was divided into theoretical physics and applied physics.

The theoretical part included three major theorems.

Seven core formulas.

Sixteen derived sub-theories.

She wrote them all out.

She created scenarios to validate with numbers.

Those that couldn't be validated were proven directly.

It was simple and brutal, but effective.

The applied physics section was more extensive.

The effect of deformation heat treatment on stainless steel properties.

Quasicrystal-enhanced alloy organizational properties.

Diffraction properties of one-dimensional quasicrystals.

Deep undercooling of alloys and quasicrystal solidification behavior.

She listed them one by one.

The second whiteboard was quickly filled.

Alexander signaled for a third one to be prepared.

She concluded with three derivation formulas.

Leaving a numerical model for verification.

A perfect finish.

She put down the marker. "That is my answer."

A slight smile appeared on Alexander's serious face. "Thank you. You may leave."

Sophia unclenched her tightly held fist.

She bowed and turned to leave.

Another examiner laughed. "Laurent, you were too harsh on that student. Few third-year graduates could answer that correctly."

Alexander said coolly, "Only outstanding students make you want to probe their limits."

She had more potential than he had imagined.

…

Sophia walked out of the examination room.

She received a text from Olivia.

They had agreed a week ago to celebrate after the interview.

The location was their usual French restaurant.

She opened a map app to call a car.

A familiar voice came from behind.

"Sophia Sullivan? It really is you."

Amelia Roscente had her afternoon interview.

She came early to familiarize herself with the environment.

She didn't expect to run into Sophia.

"What are you…" Amelia looked her over.

Sophia said calmly, "Interview."

"You passed the written exam?" Her voice nearly cracked.

"Yes."

"What was your score?"

"412."

"First in the major?"

Sophia was slightly surprised. "I didn't check the ranking…"

"Stop pretending. Is it fun?" Amelia's lips curled in mockery.

She only scored 392, barely making the interview cut.

Sophia actually did so well.

Sophia genuinely hadn't checked the ranking.

She confirmed the time after receiving the interview text and didn't bother with the rest.

The official list was sorted by score.

But she never logged in to check.

"Believe what you want. I have to go." She couldn't be bothered to explain.

Amelia's opinion didn't matter.

She had left Ethan.

There was no need to please his family.

You love the crow for the sake of its nest.

Without that love, it's all bullshit.

"Wait—" Amelia called out to her.

Sophia turned back. "Is there something else?"

"Your interview is over?"

"Yes."

Amelia's eyes flickered. "Were the questions difficult? What did they ask? Were there many professional questions?"

Sophia raised an eyebrow. "Are you asking me to leak the questions?"

"Don't put it so harshly. Just sharing experiences. The questions they ask me might be different anyway."

"True," Sophia nodded. "Since the questions are different, sharing is unnecessary."

"Moreover," she looked at Amelia and said slowly, "we are competitors. Why should I help you?"

"You—" Amelia was speechless.

Subconsciously, she still saw Sophia as the woman who tried to please everyone around her brother.

The reality was that Sophia had long started a new life.

She let go cleanly and walked away decisively.

But what about her brother?

He was hospitalized with a bleeding stomach, hoping she would visit.

He called out for her in his delirium.

For the past few months, he had been silent and depressed.

Sophia was too heartless!

Amelia coldly assessed her.

Ordinary formal wear looked spirited on her.

Her eyes were bright and clever.
###Chapter 91
She was actually doing so well without her brother!
Amelia Roscente sneered.
"Top score on the written exam means nothing."
"Getting in is not guaranteed."

She turned and walked away.
Her high heels clicked sharply on the floor.

Sophia Sullivan calmly averted her gaze.

Olivia Lopez was hopping mad.
"You just let her leave like that?!"

"What else should I have done?"

"Hit her! Yell at her! Tear her mouth off!"

Sophia continued cutting her steak.
Her movements were elegant.

"Have you heard this saying?"

"What?"

"The best revenge is to show indifference to what she cares about."
"Everything she wants, you obtain effortlessly."

Amelia cared most about graduate school.

"I will pass this final interview."

Olivia was stunned.
Then she gave a thumbs up.

"Brilliant!"

...

The final results were announced.

Sophia ranked first in both the written exam and the interview.

Amelia Roscente ranked fourth overall.
She did not get in.

She missed by a single point.

Shattering sounds came from the Roscente mansion.

Amelia smashed everything in her room.
Even her favorite bag was not spared.

Screams and cries were incessant.

The servants trembled with fear.

Ethan Roscente pushed the door open.
The mess on the floor made him frown.

"Have you had enough?"

"If you didn't get in, try again next year."

Amelia's eyes were red as she screamed.
"Can't I even be upset after something this terrible?!"

"Take your tantrum elsewhere."

"I'm not leaving! It's all Sophia Sullivan's fault!"
"If she hadn't gotten first place, I wouldn't have failed!"

Ethan froze.

"She got in?"

"Yes! She got in!"
"After leaving you, her life is perfect!"
"You regret it now, don't you? But it's too late!"

Ethan's face darkened instantly.

"Shut up!"

Victoria Roscente entered upon hearing the noise.
She scanned the room, her brow furrowed.

"If you didn't get in, just take the exam again."
"What's the use of throwing a fit at home?"

Amelia clenched her fists.

"Sophia only studied for six months."
"How does she deserve first place? I refuse to accept this!"

She stormed out of the house.

Ethan rubbed his temples and left.

Victoria looked at the devastation on the floor.
A headache was forming.

...

Amelia drove straight to Sophia's apartment.
She was burning with rage, ready to confront her.

But she saw Sophia walking into the building alongside a man.

The man was Alexander Laurent.

One of the interviewers during her final exam.

Amelia gasped.
###Chapter 92
Sophia Sullivan's eyes blazed with sharp intensity.

Her fingers trembled slightly.

So that was it.

The top interview score was rigged after all.

Amelia Roscente quickly pulled out her phone, snapping several photos of their retreating figures.

In the frame, Alexander Laurent turned slightly, his tall silhouette casting Sophia completely in shadow.

The angle was perfectly deceptive, mimicking an intimate embrace.

This trip was worth it.

Amelia sneered, putting her phone away. Sophia brought this on herself.

She returned to her car and opened her laptop, fingers flying across the keyboard.

The official MIT complaint email address appeared on screen.

She uploaded the photos, attaching a righteous accusation: "...To uphold academic integrity, we request the university re-evaluate the admission decision."

Sent anonymously.

She simultaneously updated a forum post.

The scandal between the top graduate exam scorer and the genius professor instantly went viral.

The post skyrocketed to the top of the trending list.

["Academic Sirens Return, Turning Fair Admissions Into a Joke"]

["No Room for Meritocracy Under Academic Oligarchs"]

["Photo Evidence: How Long Will MIT Stay Silent?"]

["Revoke Sophia Sullivan's Admission! Expel Alexander Laurent!"]

["If We Stay Silent Today, Who Will Speak For Us Tomorrow?"]

["Doxx Her! Make Her Socially Pariah!"]

...

Olivia Lopez was sipping milk tea when the notification popped up.

She choked, coughing violently.

Her hands shook as she scrolled through the comments, her face paling.

"This is bad..."

She immediately closed the app and called Sophia.

Sophia was organizing lab materials.

She answered the phone, her pen still in hand, leaving a long ink streak across her thesis.

"You and my brother were photographed! The whole internet is attacking you!"

Olivia's voice trembled with urgency.

Sophia clicked the link.

A blurry photo paired with vicious text stabbed into her vision like a poisoned dagger.

Her fingers turned icy, barely able to grip the phone.

"Mimi? Are you okay?"

Olivia's anxious call pulled her back to reality.

"...I'm fine."

"Don't mind those keyboard warriors! My brother will definitely handle this!"

The call had just ended when Alexander's call came through.

"The university has formed an investigation team." His voice was calm and steady. "Someone is intentionally creating public opinons to undermine your achievement."

Sophia listened silently.

"Professor Eleanor Watson has personally vouched for you. She demands a thorough investigation."

The image of the stern female professor surfaced in her mind.

A slight smile touched her lips unconsciously.

"Thank you."

"Feeling better?" Alexander asked softly.

"Yes."

"Excellence is never a crime." He paused. "Don't be afraid. The truth will come out."

Sophia's ears felt warm. "Okay."

...

The next day, the trending list was completely different.

Sophia's test video swept across the internet.

The girl on camera was composed and sharp, every answer precise and incisive.

["Is this brain for real? I listened three times and still didn't get it!"]

["No way to cheat an MIT interview! I've taken it twice, I know!"]

["Am I the only one noticing her looks? What a goddess!"]

["They look perfect together! Hope no one minds if I ship them secretly..."]
###Chapter 93
No More Miss Nice Guy

Sharp-eyed netizens quickly discovered the video was posted by MIT's official account.

This directly cleared Sophia Sullivan's name.

In the video, Alexander Laurent was the last interviewer to ask a question.

Then—

[An English question?!]

[This isn't going easy on her, it's nightmare difficulty.]

[My scalp tingled when that English started.]

[First time seeing someone solve a problem live during an interview.]

[Professor Laurent even prepared a whiteboard. So considerate.]

[Is no one talking about how hot Alexander Laurent is?]

[Completely shattered my stereotype of scholars.]

[Those wire-rimmed glasses! The ultimate sophisticated bad boy!]

A few negative comments remained.

They were quickly swarmed by other netizens.

[Think we're fools?]

[Clearly being used as pawns.]

[Fight back!]

Olivia Lopez monitored the public opinion closely.

She immediately sent Sophia a WeChat link when she saw the turnaround.

The weather was warming. Tender sprouts appeared in the window box planter.

Sophia was trimming dead leaves when her phone buzzed.

It was a link from Olivia.

She took off her gloves, washed her hands, and clicked it.

A familiar voice came from the video.

This was her first time watching the interview from an observer's perspective.

Her gaze involuntarily focused on Alexander Laurent.

From his question to his mid-way ask if she wanted to give up.

To that faint, almost imperceptible smile at the corner of his lips at the end.

The man was professional, rigorous, yet still a gentleman.

"Mimi, check the comments!"

A new message popped up. Sophia opened the comments section.

The previously toxic space was now completely transformed.

Some were even making memes and shipping them.

She was utterly confused.

How did the internet go from hating her to obsessing over looks?

This development was unexpected.

Surely this was the end of it?

A heavy weight lifted from her heart. She was about to put her phone down.

The screen lit up with an incoming call from "Sebastian Evans."

She hesitated for two seconds before answering.

"I saw what happened online... are you okay?"

Sophia replied softly, "It's resolved."

"MIT was very effective this time." He hadn't even had time to intervene.

"Is there something you need, Mr. Evans?"

A bitter laugh came from the other end. "We're this familiar, can't you call me something else?"

"Like what?"

"Seb? Sebby? Or just Sebastian?"

"You're joking, Mr. Evans."

"...One day you'll call me Seb willingly."

"We'll talk about that later. I'll hang up if there's nothing else."

"Wait—I do have serious business today."

"?"

His tone turned serious. "The Maldives incident is cleared up."

Sophia instinctively sat up straight. "Go on."

"Are you free? Let's meet. I have some things to give you."

She checked the time and arranged to meet him the next afternoon.

...

The next day at the restaurant.

Sebastian pushed a manila envelope across the table as soon as she sat down.

"Documents from the legal team. Have a look first."

"The cross-border lawsuit took a year to advance. The hotel was forced to provide all surveillance footage."

"We found a witness by chance and followed the trail to the truth."

Sebastian already knew. He wasn't surprised by the outcome.

He tapped the table lightly, watching Sophia with a meaningful look.

"You're the victim. It's your decision what to do with this evidence."

Sophia's fingers curled slightly. She picked up the envelope and opened it.

It detailed how Isabella Langley bribed a diving instructor to swap the oxygen tank.

And how the gift box containing the venomous snake was planted.

Photos and videos were attached. The evidence was irrefutable.

Three attempts on her life, nearly succeeding.

She should have been furious, but she felt strangely calm.

As if she had expected this outcome all along.

After a long moment, she looked up and spoke deliberately.

"You're leaving the file for me to handle?"

"Yes."

"Then I'm calling the police."

Interest flickered in Sebastian's eyes. "Not telling Ethan Roscente?"

"Why would I tell him? We're long over. I'm calling the police because Isabella broke the law."

"This isn't about winning anyone back. It's about defending my right to life."

Her parents raised her with care, not to be bullied.

For herself and for justice, she wouldn't play the saint.

As for Ethan Roscente, he was neither police nor judge.

Whether he knew was irrelevant.

Sebastian cautioned, "Be prepared. The outcome might not meet expectations."

...

Leaving the restaurant, Sophia went to the police station with Sebastian to file a report.

The police accepted the case quickly.

But an experienced officer recognized it as a foreign case immediately.

Evidence collection was difficult. The photos and videos were grainy. It would likely be dismissed.

After a few words of caution, and seeing Sophia's insistence, they summoned Isabella Langley per procedure.

Isabella was participating in a major school event at that very moment.

She took the stage as host, basking in the admiring gazes from all sides.

She had just raised the microphone to speak.

The police arrived.
###Chapter 94

Isabella Langley was led away under everyone's gaze.

Her face was pale.

Her first thought was that her actions abroad had been exposed.

The surrounding looks were full of shock and suspicion.

She forced a calm smile.

"It must be a misunderstanding."

"I'll be right back."

Her three roommates exchanged uneasy glances.

They could only watch as she was taken away.

"What's going on?"

"Is she really in trouble?"

"Should we notify her family?"

"Do you have their contact info?"

A roommate suddenly remembered Ethan Roscente.

He had brought Isabella back to the dorm that one time.

He left a business card.

She rushed back to the dorm to search for it.

She dialed the number.

Ethan had just finished a meeting.

His private phone rang.

Only a handful of people knew this number.

He answered the call.

"Mr. Roscente? I'm Isabella's roommate."

"She was taken by the police!"

"Can you go to the station to check on her?"

Ethan frowned.

His voice was cold.

"Understood."

He grabbed his jacket and went downstairs.

He got into his car.

"To the police station."

The police don't arrest people without reason.

There had to be a cause.

He toyed with his phone.

His gaze grew colder.

He dialed his assistant.

"Find out why Isabella Langley was taken in."

...

At the police station.

Just as the senior officer predicted.

The incidents abroad couldn't be prosecuted.

Only a verbal warning was issued.

Isabella breathed a sigh of relief.

She walked out of the station.

She saw the Cayenne parked at the entrance.

Ethan was leaning against the hood.

Playing with his phone.

She rushed over happily.

"Baby, you came to pick me—"

The coldness in his eyes made her freeze.

Her smile stiffened on her face.

Ethan straightened up.

He stepped closer.

"Was it you who caused the incident in the Maldives?"

Terrified, she reached for his hand.

"Baby, let me explain—"

Ethan shook her off.

His eyes were full of mockery.

"The facts are right here. What else is there to explain?"

His assistant had called just as he arrived at the station.

He heard the whole story while sitting in his car.

The Maldives was no accident!

Isabella was the mastermind behind it all.

He had been completely fooled.

Sebastian Evans had warned him.

But he believed in her goodness.

And the result?

His face stung from the slap of reality.

Isabella met his icy stare.

Her heart sank.

She still refused to admit it.

"I did it all because I love you."

"I just wanted to be with you."

"Can you forgive me this time?"

"I promise there won't be a next time!"

Ethan's face was expressionless.

Frost gathered in his eyes.

"This is a crime!"

"Don't use love as an excuse."

"You hurt the person most important to me."

"Is this how you love me?"

"You're only thinking of yourself!"

"Let's break up."

"Don't appear in front of me again."

"I want nothing more to do with you."

Isabella tried to grab his sleeve.

Ethan issued a cold warning.

"Considering you saved me once."

"I'll let it slide this time."

"Don't think you'll be this lucky every time."

He turned and got into the car.

It sped away.

Isabella wanted to chase after him.

A sudden pain shot through her lower abdomen.

She rarely had period cramps.

Her period was over two weeks late.

She felt a dampness between her legs.

She had to go to the hospital first.

She went to the emergency room.

The doctor asked some questions and ordered tests.

Half an hour later.

She stared at the report in shock.

"I'm pregnant?"

The doctor nodded.

"HCG positive. Confirmed pregnancy."

"There's bleeding in the early stage. Get plenty of rest."

Isabella only heard the word "pregnant."

Based on the timing, it must have happened during the New Year.

She clutched the test report tightly.

Her eyes suddenly turned determined.

As if she had found hope.

She was pregnant!

Would Ethan still want to break up?

She took a taxi straight to the Beverly Hills mansion.

The passcode lock hadn't been changed.

Her fingerprint unlocked it successfully.

The door opened.

Ethan was still fuming.

He had been played by a woman.

The information was likely Sebastian's doing.

The thought of the other man possibly laughing at him.

Made his anger burn hotter.

Hearing the door open.

He said impatiently.

"Martha, I'm not hungry—"

His voice cut off abruptly.

He saw Isabella.

A storm gathered in his eyes.

"You dare to come here?"

"Do you really think I won't lay a hand on you?"

He stood on the staircase.

Looking down at her from above.

The scorn and rejection in his gaze made her want to retreat.

But feeling the test report in her bag.

She found her courage again.

"Baby, I'm pregnant."

"I just got tested. Almost two months."

"You're going to be a dad—"

"Get rid of it."

Isabella froze.

"What did you say?"

Ethan put a hand in his pocket.

He repeated impatiently.

"Get an abortion. Didn't you hear me?"

He threw a card at her.

"Three million. Take it."

"We're over."

"Stay out of my life."
###Chapter 95

Isabella Langley trembled all over.

The man's gaze was like an ice pick piercing her heart.

She hadn't expected him to be so resolute.

He was extinguishing even the last shred of hope.

She couldn't accept it!

"Ethan, I admit I was wrong, but the child is your flesh and blood! Look at the ultrasound, the fetal heartbeat is there. Do you really want them to be born without a father?"

Ethan Roscente glanced down at the blurry black and white image.

A mocking curve touched his lips.

"That's exactly why I said an abortion is best."

"A child without a father is better off never existing."

He didn't believe it was his.

He turned and walked away.

The sound of his footsteps on the stairs felt like they were crushing her heart.

She clenched her fists tightly.

Her nails dug into her palms.

Why was he treating her like this?

She was just fighting for love.

What was so wrong about that?

It was all Sophia Sullivan's fault!

That bitch kept seducing Ethan.

She had driven her into a corner.

Hatred gnawed at her reason.

Her beautiful face twisted with rage.

She couldn't just give up.

A sudden thought occurred to her.

A strange light flickered in her eyes.

...

Saturday morning.

Sophia received a call from the police.

The officer sounded apologetic.

She listened calmly.

This outcome was expected.

She had insisted on reporting it only for a clear conscience.

The rest was up to fate.

She hung up.

A short video notification popped up on her phone.

The forum's defamatory post had long been deleted.

The school traced the IP address to another state.

The number was deactivated when they followed up.

Clearly, someone had set it up deliberately.

Although the mastermind wasn't found,

she had become famous even before starting school.

Someone had taken a photo of her profile.

She was unexpectedly voted MIT's campus belle.

Sophia shook her head helplessly.

She turned off her phone to work on her thesis.

The doorbell rang.

Thinking it was her food delivery,

she opened the door to find Ethan Roscente.

She immediately tried to close it.

The man forcefully held the doorframe.

"Sophia, don't close it! I heard about what happened in the Maldives. I came to apologize!"

Afraid of being shut out again,

he spoke rapidly.

"Isabella deliberately manipulated me into feeling sorry for her. I was blind not to see it. I've broken up with her. There will be no further involvement."

He looked down at her.

His voice was pleading.

"Can we start over? I truly can't live without you."

During this time, he had finally realized.

The only one he wanted was Sophia Sullivan.

He couldn't let go.

Those sweet memories were etched deeply.

If this were before,

she would have thrown herself into his arms.

But now...

It was meaningless.

Belated affection is cheaper than grass.

Sophia listened expressionlessly.

Her hand remained on the doorknob.

Her defensive posture was clear.

"I refuse."

No forgiveness.

No reconciliation.

Ethan instantly became agitated.

"Why?! It was because of Isabella before! Now I've cleaned it all up! Why are you still unwilling?!"

He had conceded so much.

What more did she want?

Compared to his agitation,

Sophia was exceptionally calm.

"Before, my world only had you. You were everything."

She gave up graduate school for him.

At the peak of their love,

he was the one she wanted to spend her life with.

Ethan's eyes lit up.

He gripped the doorframe eagerly.

"We still can! Just say the word, and we can go back to how we were!"

Sophia shook her head gently.

"No one stays in the same place forever. You won't. I won't either."

"After we separated, I discovered there's so much more to pursue in this world besides love."

Ethan's gaze turned gloomy.

"Pursue what? Grad school? Studying? You'll still have to work after your Master's! Work is just for money! I can give you however much you want!"

Sophia frowned.

"I don't want money."

Ethan scoffed.

"You took that 7.2 million dollar check, didn't you? Now you say you don't want money? Who would believe that? Or were you only after my money from the very beginning?!"

Anger made him reckless with his words.

Sophia couldn't be bothered to argue.

She shoved the door hard.

Ethan stumbled back two steps, caught off guard.

"Grad school isn't that simple! The academics, the lab work... you're not the same Sophia Sullivan anymore!"

Before he finished,

the door slammed shut with a loud bang.

The impact echoed through the hallway.

Ethan stood outside.

His face was dark with anger.

He swore to himself he would make her regret this.

...

Early April spring.

Tender green buds sprouted on the branches.

The wind grew gentle.

Sophia went to visit Professor Eleanor Watson.

It was their first meeting since the New Year.

The weather was warmer.

Eleanor Watson's health had gradually improved.

She was back on the research front lines.

She was so busy she barely had time to eat.

Seeing Sophia, she immediately shoved a stack of materials into her hands.

They were all first-hand lab data.

Along with relevant research papers.

Sophia skimmed through them.

Some papers were quite old.

The content was obscure and hard to find.

Gathering these must have taken tremendous effort.

Her eyes stung.

Eleanor Watson saw right through her.

"The seniors helped find the materials! I just pointed them in the right direction! These old bones couldn't manage it alone."
###Chapter 96
Sophia Sullivan took the stack of materials.

Professor Eleanor Watson advised her, "Master all these research directions before you start in September."

"That way you won't fall behind when you join the lab group."

Sophia nodded solemnly. "Don't worry, Professor. I'll get up to speed as quickly as possible."

"I won't hold anyone back."

A look of relief shone in Eleanor's eyes. "I watched your interview recording."

"All these years, I've worried your skills might have gotten rusty."

She gave Sophia's shoulder a gentle pat. "But you haven't lost your touch at all."

"Especially your answer to Alexander Laurent's question. It was better than some of my third-year PhD students."

"Your logic and critical thinking were a pleasant surprise."

Sophia pressed her lips together, her eyes gleaming.

"You're my student. I know your capabilities better than anyone."

"You have the talent. Don't doubt yourself."

…

Professor Watson was called away by a phone call.

Sophia took the materials home.

She replayed her teacher's words in her mind the entire way.

There had been plenty of self-doubt over the years.

Especially after learning Professor Watson's research had hit a prolonged standstill.

She was afraid of being more of a hindrance than a help.

…

Sophia opened the folder.

The papers were arranged by year.

The earliest ones dated back to the 1940s.

When the field of biology was just establishing its independence.

She used to be merely an observer.

Now, it felt like she was walking in the footsteps of those who came before.

It was a strange and wonderful feeling.

She became completely absorbed.

Her phone suddenly rang.

She answered it absently.

"Is this the family of Olivia Lopez? This is Massachusetts General Hospital."

"She's been in a car accident. Please come immediately."

Sophia's hand jerked. The papers scattered across the floor.

She grabbed her bag and bank card, rushing out without even her coat.

A taxi happened to be passing by.

"Massachusetts General, please! Hurry!"

The driver, an older man, saw her pale face and immediately hit the gas.

"Hold on tight, miss. We'll be there in no time."

Sophia thanked him, her fingers clutching the edge of her shirt.

She kept calling Olivia's number.

It was always off.

The car radio was broadcasting the news.

"A multi-vehicle pileup on Westside Road. A bus rear-ended a truck."

"Ten injured, one fatality…"

Westside Road was right near Olivia's company.

Sophia's heart sank like a stone.

…

The taxi arrived at the hospital quickly.

The wail of ambulance sirens pierced the air.

The injured were being rushed into the ER.

Sophia ran to the front desk, her voice trembling. "I'm looking for Olivia Lopez."

The nurse looked down at her records. "Are you family?"

"Yes. I just got the call."

The nurse paused, then pointed inside. "Go say your goodbyes."

Sophia pushed the hospital room door open.

A white sheet covered the bed.

Her legs gave way. She nearly collapsed.

A familiar voice suddenly came from behind—

"Sophia?"

Sophia whirled around.

Olivia stood there, perfectly fine.

"You scared me to death!" Sophia's voice cracked. "Who is that?"

A nurse hurried over. "Ma'am, your friend is in the next room."

"You walked right past her when you came in."

Sophia stood frozen.

…

Out in the hallway.

Olivia shook her hand. "Don't be mad."

"My bad, okay?"

Sophia kept a stern face, silent.

Olivia leaned closer. "You'll get wrinkles if you keep frowning."

"Even with wrinkles, you'd be the prettiest old lady."

Sophia finally couldn't hold back a laugh.

Olivia sighed in relief. "Sunshine after the rain!"

"What happened? How did you hurt your face?"

Olivia touched her cheek. "I was going for BBQ after work. Passed by Westside Road and got caught in the accident."

"Got nicked by some glass. Took a tumble."

"The paramedics insisted on bringing me in for a check-up."

She shuddered. "Any closer, and I'd be the one in the ER."

Sophia gripped her hand tightly. "I'm just glad you're okay."

Olivia grinned. "My luck's always been good."

"Though you really thought I was a goner, huh?"

She winked. "If I'd waited one more second, you definitely would've burst into tears."
###Chapter 97
Fine. You win.

Hospital policy requires contacting family for accident victims.

I didn't want to worry my parents, so I had to give them your number.

Olivia Lopez sighed and pulled out her phone.

The screen was shattered and black. It couldn't receive any calls.

Sophia Sullivan finally understood why it had been off.

How are you? Are you feeling okay?

Passing the multi-car accident scene, Sophia was concerned for her friend's condition.

All the tests were done. Everything's normal.

I can be discharged once the paperwork is finished.

Sophia breathed a complete sigh of relief.

Olivia only had a small bag with her.

They finished settling the bill and were about to leave.

They ran straight into Victoria Roscente.

Isabella Langley was with her.

They were talking with their heads close together. Victoria was smiling, and Isabella was nodding along.

They looked perfectly harmonious.

Victoria advised, "Be more careful from now on. Avoid any bumps."

Isabella replied obediently, "Don't worry, I'll be very careful."

Olivia sneered. "No wonder the mistress is so brazen. She has the scumbag's mom backing her up."

Victoria was seeing Sophia for the first time in half a year.

She wasn't the downcast mess Victoria had imagined. Instead, she looked well.

Isabella's steps faltered as she also saw Sophia.

She instinctively cradled the small of her back, pushing her stomach out slightly.

She initiated the greeting. "Sophia, what a coincidence? Fancy meeting you at the hospital."

Sophia's smile faded. She moved to step around them.

Isabella said, seemingly without thought, "My stomach's been bothering me lately. The check-up showed I'm pregnant."

Sophia stopped walking.

"I didn't expect it either. It was such a surprise."

"But for Ethan, it's the most wonderful news."

"It's still early. Not showing yet."

"I'm worried about going out later when my belly gets bigger. And all the food restrictions..."

Isabella chattered on with a smile.

Sophia turned. Her expression was calm. "Congratulations. But you don't need to tell me all this."

"But I wanted to share it with you..."

Olivia immediately exploded. "Share my ass! I've never seen a mistress so shameless! Think you're special because you're pregnant? Even a sow can get pregnant! What's there to boast about?"

"You should focus on tricking Ethan Roscente into marrying you before you start showing! You're playing a terrible hand poorly, and still have the nerve to disgust others? Are you stupid?"

"How... how can you say that..." Isabella bit her lip, tears welling in her eyes, looking utterly wronged.

Victoria immediately shielded her. "Miss Lopez, watch your language!"

Olivia gave a fake smile. "Sorry. I can't be polite to someone who's shameless and without a shred of decency."

"You!" Victoria felt personally attacked.

But she didn't dare retort. A retort would be an admission.

She could only glare furiously at Olivia.

If looks could kill, Olivia would be full of holes.

"Miss Lopez, you must... have some misunderstanding about me." Isabella looked up timidly, pitifully.

Olivia wasn't buying it. "Misunderstanding what? That you have shame? That you know decency?"

Victoria snapped, "Olivia Lopez, that's enough! I am your elder, after all."

"Oh, losing the argument so you pull rank? I've never bowed to pressure. Want to hear something even worse?"

Victoria was speechless.

"Alright, Olivia. Arguing is pointless. Don't bother."

Sophia couldn't be bothered with a war of words. What would winning prove?

Her mild tone and calm eyes were like a lit fuse. Victoria exploded.

"You're jealous, aren't you?" she sneered. "You were with Ethan for so many years with no result. Look how quickly Isabella got pregnant!"

"A barren hen can only deceive a young, foolish Ethan. Dreaming of entering the Roscente family? Keep dreaming!"

No wonder Victoria lost her composure. Sophia hadn't even given her a proper look. This disregard felt like an insult.

Before, she was the one who treated Sophia like air, and Sophia had to endure it.

Now the roles were reversed. The power was in Sophia's hands.

Victoria couldn't accept it.

It was like a dog that used to grovel at her feet suddenly jumped on the table, barking and biting her.

Sophia smiled. "Sorry, I don't have those dreams. Anyone who wants to can enter the Roscente family. Anyone who wants him can have your son. It's all nothing to do with me."

"You—"

Victoria's face turned purple with rage.

Isabella suddenly grabbed Sophia's hand. Her grip was strong.

Sophia didn't shake her off immediately.

Isabella said with sincere emotion, "Sophia, thank you for your blessing. Ethan, our child, and I will be a happy family of three."

Sophia's smile didn't change. "Good luck."

"Thank you."

Olivia rolled her eyes, grabbed Sophia, and walked away.

As they left, she ranted loudly—

"Does she think she's in a drama? 'Sophia'... so fake. She's performing her own version of 'The Schemes of a Harem' all by herself! What a waste not being an extra!"

"Is Ethan Roscente blind? With a feast right in front of him, he goes for this coarse grain? Isn't he afraid of burning his throat?"

Sophia was silent.

"And Ethan's mother. Do the Roscentes have a royal throne to inherit? The Qing dynasty fell centuries ago! Does she really think the Roscente home is some paradise everyone wants to enter? Even if it was paradise, with her there, it'd turn into a filthy sewer!"

"'Barren hen'... She's watched too many toxic mother-in-law shorts and started identifying with the role?"

Olivia's tirade wasn't hushed. She deliberately drew out her words.

Isabella's face was ugly.

Victoria's expression was twisted. "Outrageous! How dare they!"

A passing young person gave her a strange look. "Is this auntie from some ancient family drama?"
###Chapter 98
This is So Ugly!

The more Victoria Roscente thought about it, the angrier she became.

Her chest heaved violently.

Olivia Lopez's words pierced her heart like needles.

She suddenly broke into a run, chasing after them.

This was completely out of character for her.

She had always looked down on people who couldn't take a hint.

Yet now, she had become one of them.

Hearing the footsteps, Olivia turned around.

She raised an eyebrow. "What? Not done yelling?"

Victoria's face was dark with rage. "Birds of a feather! You and Sophia Sullivan are both utterly classless!"

Olivia instantly saw red.

She could insult her all she wanted, but not Sophia.

"Shut your mouth, you old hag!"

"Did I say something wrong? She was with my son for six years and never got pregnant. She's nothing but a barren hen!"

Olivia sneered. "Maybe the problem is your son? He's constantly smoking and drinking, a regular at the hospital. I suggest you take him for a check-up before it's too late for regrets—"

She glanced meaningfully at Isabella Langley's stomach.

Isabella's face paled instantly. "Ethan is the only man I've ever been with. This child is definitely his..."

Victoria exploded. "How dare you curse my son? I'll tear your mouth apart!"

Olivia rolled up her sleeves. "Bring it on! Let's see who tears whose!"

Sophia quickly pulled Olivia back.

Seeing this, Isabella's eyes flickered.

She suddenly let out a sharp cry.

Her whole body went limp as she collapsed onto the ground.

"My stomach... it hurts so much..."

Victoria immediately panicked.

Forgetting about Olivia, she crouched down. "Isabella, are you okay? Is the baby alright?"

Tears welled in Isabella's eyes. "I think so... I just don't know why Sophia pushed me..."

Victoria glared furiously at Sophia. "You can't have a child yourself, so you try to harm someone else's? How vile!"

Sophia's expression remained blank.

She had seen everything clearly.

When Isabella fell, one hand protected her stomach, the other broke her fall. It was an obvious fake.

The acting was terribly clumsy.

She couldn't even fake pain convincingly.

Sophia spoke calmly. "Since you accused me of pushing you, I shouldn't be blamed for nothing."

She reached a hand toward Isabella.

Isabella shrank back in fear. "It was my carelessness... It has nothing to do with Sophia..."

Victoria was half-convinced, half-doubting. "Are you sure you're okay? We should still get it checked to be safe."

Isabella shook her head repeatedly. "Really, it's not necessary, ma'am. Let's just go back."

She didn't dare risk anything happening to the baby.

Victoria finally relented.

She helped Isabella to her feet.

Olivia snorted in derision. "The theatrics are strong with this one."

Victoria shot her a venomous look before leading Isabella away.

Olivia stamped her foot in frustration. "You shouldn't have stopped me!"

Sophia smiled reassuringly. "She's not worth getting angry over."

"Come on, let me buy you dinner to calm your nerves."

Olivia immediately slung an arm around her. "I want the most expensive place!"

"Fine, fine, anything you want."

...

Inside the car.

Victoria looked over the medical report, a smile tugging at her lips.

The doctor said the fetus was very healthy.

Isabella watched her expression, feeling slightly relieved.

This was her first time meeting Victoria.

Ethan Roscente had never been willing to talk about his family.

She only knew they were very wealthy.

After he broke up with her, she had pulled every string to get in touch with Victoria.

Fortunately, the other party placed great importance on this child.

Isabella took out a prepared gift.

She smiled sweetly. "Ma'am, this is a small token of my appreciation."

Victoria was somewhat surprised.

She hadn't expected a gift.

She seemed more thoughtful than Sophia.

She accepted the box with a smile.

The moment she opened it, her smile froze.

Inside was a hand-knitted scarf.

The stitches were crooked and uneven.

The color combination was also very strange.

Victoria suppressed her distaste. "You made this yourself?"

Isabella nodded. "I hope you like it."

Victoria was speechless.

Sophia used to gift her designer silk scarves.

Nothing as shabby as this.

She clearly had access to his credit card, yet she gave this... trash?

Isabella asked cautiously, "You don't like it? I thought something handmade would show more sincerity."

Remembering she was carrying her grandson, Victoria forced a smile. "I like it. It's the thought that counts."

Isabella said happily, "Then I'll knit you one every year from now on!"

Victoria's vision went dark.

She absolutely did not want to receive another one of these hideous things.
###Chapter 99

She saw Isabella Langley off at the school gate.

Victoria Roscente offered a few more reminders.

"Be careful."

"Watch the baby."

Only then did she tell the driver to head back.

The car drove smoothly.

Victoria sat in the back seat.

Her gaze fell on the scarf beside her.

A garish, vulgar shade of magenta.

The more she looked at it, the more it irritated her.

She tossed it carelessly under the seat.

She recoiled her hand quickly.

As if she had touched something filthy.

She couldn't help but frown, thinking of Isabella's petty demeanor.

Plain-looking, timid in her actions.

'Naive' was putting it kindly.

'Unpresentable' was more accurate.

Her eyes swept over the scarf again.

Inferior yarn, crude stitching.

No fancy packaging could hide its cheapness.

Typical of someone from a modest background.

Limited vision.

She recalled the gifts Sophia Sullivan used to give.

Silk scarves, jewelry, handbags.

Each one exquisite and tasteful.

Clearly chosen with care...

Victoria snapped back to reality.

Why was she thinking of that jinx?

...

"Madam, we're home."

Amelia Roscente greeted her as soon as she entered.

Her eyes lit up seeing the beautifully wrapped box in her mother's hand.

But inside was a magenta scarf.

The stitching was crooked.

The color was utterly tacky.

"Mom, what is this ugly thing? You're not actually going to wear it, are you?"

Amelia picked up the scarf with two fingers.

Her face was full of disdain.

The taste was a disaster.

The magenta was dowdy.

The craftsmanship was appallingly rough.

Victoria said irritably, "That girlfriend of your brother's sent it. Said she knitted it herself, 'full of heart.' I think she's just too cheap to spend money. Foisting this trash on me."

If it weren't for the pregnancy, this garbage would never have entered the Roscente home.

Every item she owned was a brand name.

Custom pieces, designer labels.

This scarf wasn't even fit for their dog.

"What?!" Amelia's eyes widened. "She's pregnant with my brother's child?!"

Sophia Sullivan had shown no signs for years.

This Isabella Langley certainly had some skills.

Got herself knocked up so quickly.

So desperate to climb the social ladder.

Victoria said, "I just found out today. If she hadn't called, I'd still be in the dark."

Amelia raised an eyebrow. "She contacted you directly? Not my brother?"

Victoria nodded. "Why?"

Amelia's expression turned knowing. "Think about it. Why would she go behind my brother's back to you?"

Victoria paused.

"He must not want the baby. So she came to you for support."

Trying to use her pregnancy to secure a position.

This drama was all too common among the wealthy families in Kyoto.

What woman didn't want to marry into riches?

Amelia's eyes gleamed. "Mom, you're not actually going to let her into the family, are you?"

Victoria frowned. "Of course not! We don't even know if it's a boy or a girl. Besides, she's plain, her taste is awful, completely unpresentable. I heard she just graduated from some ordinary tech institute. How could the Roscente family accept a daughter-in-law like that?"

In her eyes, her son was flawless.

His wife should at least have a master's from a prestigious university.

An overseas background was even better.

Isabella didn't measure up in any way.

If it weren't for the child, she wouldn't have even agreed to meet.

Want to marry into the Roscente family?

Dream on!

Amelia shrugged, having expected this.

She threw the scarf into the trash.

She meticulously wiped her hands with a wet wipe.

Afraid of catching the poor person's stench.

"Good. Who does Isabella Langley think she is? She's not fit to be my sister-in-law. She's not even as good as Sophia Sullivan."

Just an empty title of 'school beauty.'

No family background, no capabilities.

She had no idea what her brother saw in her.

He must be blind!

"Ugh, I'm so sick of my brother's mess. Don't tell me about it. I'm going out!"

Amelia grabbed her gifts and imported fruits.

She hurried out the door.

She was going to see Professor Eleanor Watson.

To plead for a graduate spot one more time.

If the professor agreed to expand enrollment, she had hope!

Victoria followed her to the door with reminders. "The roads are slippery, drive carefully…"

Arriving at Professor Watson's house, memories of her last rejection surfaced.

Amelia pressed her lips together, feeling timid.

But her future was at stake.

She took a deep breath and got out of the car with her gifts.

This time, she didn't bring too much.

The emphasis was on sincerity.

She had practiced what to say repeatedly beforehand.

The most appropriate angle for a smile.

She walked along the quiet path to the professor's house.

But she didn't see the professor herself.

A familiar figure was tending to the plants in the yard.

"...Sophia Sullivan?!"

Eleanor Watson enjoyed gardening.

She had a dedicated small garden in the front yard.

Lately, she'd been busy, and the weather was cold.

Afraid the plants would freeze, she had specifically asked Sophia to look after them.

Only Sophia was suited for this task.

She was careful and experienced.

Professor Watson had simply given her a key.

Sophia had been coming often over the past month.

Amelia saw her gloves were covered in mud.

The soil, damp from recent rain, had been turned over.

Clearly, she had been working for a while.

This time, she wasn't foolish enough to think Sophia was here doing manual labor.

But...

Her relationship with the professor was obviously unusual!

Amelia immediately spoke with a sour tone. "I underestimated you. Quite resourceful, using this method to curry favor with the professor. Is this how you scored high on the interview?"

She'd heard many students would do anything to ingratiate themselves with their advisors.

In name, it was a teacher-student relationship.

But in secret, it was no different from being a personal assistant.

At everyone's beck and call.

Worse than a dog.
###Chapter 100
Sophia Sullivan's gaze turned icy.

"The interview videos are public."

"If you dispute the score, take it up with the administration."

"The cost of spreading rumors is too low."

"Like the person who posted those photos of me and Professor Laurent online."

"They still haven't been identified."

She stared directly at Amelia Roscente.

At the mention of the photos, Amelia's eyes darted away.

Sophia smirked inwardly.

So it was her.

Amelia lifted her chin.

"What are you so smug about?"

"Isabella Langley is pregnant with my brother's child."

"You didn't know, did you?"

Sophia let out a soft, indifferent sound.

"I knew half a day before you did."

Amelia was speechless.

"Are you here to see Professor Watson?"

"She's not in."

"You can leave now."

Amelia instantly bristled.

"Who do you think you are?"

"Even if Professor Watson isn't here, you don't get to throw me out!"

"I'm going inside today!"

"What are you going to do about it?"

"She can't do anything."

"But surely the owner of this office can."

Professor Eleanor Watson walked in, adjusting her glasses.

Her expression was frosty.

Amelia froze.

She wondered how much Professor Watson had overheard.

"Professor Watson, I was just—"

"I remember you."

The gaze behind the lenses was sharp.

"You came to see me last time, too."

Before Amelia could feel pleased.

Professor Watson spoke sternly.

"Was I not clear enough last time?"

"I am a professor."

"Students must earn their grades through merit."

"Not by figuring out how to cut in line!"

Her tone was severe.

"Take your things and leave."

"I do not wish to see you here a third time."

…

Amelia walked out of the courtyard.

Rejected twice in a row.

She was dejected, and even more resentful.

Professor Watson was all smiles with Sophia Sullivan.

But with her, it was nothing but harsh words.

Why?

What did Sophia have that she didn't?

She was stewing in her anger.

A gentle voice spoke.

"You're one of the students from the graduate interview, aren't you?"

Amelia looked up.

An elderly woman in a dark green cheongsam.

Her silver hair was impeccably styled.

She carried an air of elegant composure.

This neighborhood was full of professors.

This woman must be from MIT's School of Life Sciences too.

"You are… Professor Lowell?"

Amelia was surprised and secretly delighted.

She had seen information about Victoria Lowell online.

Her academic achievements weren't as renowned as Eleanor Watson's.

But her recent work was impressive.

Her career was on a sharp upward trajectory.

More importantly.

Professor Lowell was known for her gentle demeanor.

Not nearly as severe as Professor Watson.

Being recognized by such a professor.

Amelia immediately felt a renewed sense of hope.

"I sat in on the last interview."

"I remember you."

"Fourth place, just missed the cut."

"Only a fraction behind the third candidate."

Professor Lowell smiled kindly.

"I still have one graduate position available."

"Would you be interested in being my student?"
###Chapter 101
A glimmer of delight flashed in Amelia's eyes. "Really? Is that possible?"

"Of course."

"I'd love to! I've always hoped to be your student."

She seemed to have completely forgotten what just happened at Professor Eleanor Watson's house.

"Then it's settled. You are..."

"Professor Lowell, my name is Amelia Roscente," she immediately supplied. "I'm a biology major at MIT."

"A current student? Your foundation should be solid." A satisfied smile appeared on Professor Victoria Lowell's face. "Remember to come find me in Zone C when the semester starts for registration. I'll introduce you to the senior lab members."

Introducing the senior lab members?

Amelia recalled the important experimental project Professor Lowell was leading.

Her heart began to race.

If she could join that research team...

The research groups at MIT were all top-tier. Even Sophia Sullivan might not be able to get in, right?

Thinking of this, her smile widened.

Professor Lowell was pleased with her reaction.

She narrowed her eyes, gazing in the direction of Professor Eleanor Watson's house. A meaningful smile played on her lips.

Two tigers cannot share one mountain.

She considered herself no less capable than Eleanor Watson. Her connections and resources were even superior.

Yet, the institute always funneled funding and resources toward Eleanor.

Why?

Just because she had more seniority?

Eleanor's research project had shown no progress for three years. The graduate students she mentored were all decidedly average.

This year's admissions situation was especially dismal.

Rumor had it that among the three graduate students who stayed, there was even an older, mature-age candidate.

Who knows how many times they had to take the exam just to get in.

It was true. When people got old, their judgment declined.

What kind of innate talent could a mature-age student possibly have?

Only someone as soft-hearted as Eleanor would take them in.

Unlike herself. She had already pre-screened the interview candidates.

She knew Amelia Roscente inside and out.

Excellent family background. Substantial financial resources. Future research funding wouldn't be a worry at all.

Let's see what Eleanor Watson could use to compete with her this time!

...

Meanwhile, the so-called "mature-age student," Sophia Sullivan, had finished tending to the plants.

She tidied up the yard and prepared to say goodbye to her professor.

"The weeds are all pulled. The yellowed leaves and branches have been pruned. All the greenery has been watered." She explained everything in meticulous detail. "It's cool now. You can water them again in a few days."

Professor Eleanor Watson found it headache-inducing. "Who's the professor here, you or me? I remember all this."

Sophia washed her hands and put on her down jacket.

She linked arms with Professor Watson, slowly walking with her from the yard toward the front door.

"I just can't help reminding you. You always forget to water them. The baby bok choy I just picked is washed and in the kitchen. The housekeeper can stir-fry it directly when she arrives later."

Professor Watson shook her head helplessly but listened patiently until she finished.

"Nothing else, right? It's almost dark. You're becoming quite the chatterbox."

Sophia pouted slightly, rearranging the professor's shawl which had come loose.

"Alright, no more chattering. I'm really leaving this time. I'll visit again another day."

"Go on. Be careful on your way. Remember to message me when you get home."

She watched the young woman leave with a warm smile.

Only when that figure had completely disappeared did Professor Eleanor Watson's straight posture gradually slump.

The smile slowly faded from her face.
###Chapter 102

She had just received the notification from the institute.

Seventy percent of this year's graduate research funding had been allocated to Professor Victoria Lowell's research group.

The remainder would be distributed to others, including her.

After accounting for various expenses, the actual usable amount might be less than twenty percent.

In recent years, her experiments had stagnated.

Paper output was almost zero.

Without papers, there were no academic achievements.

Funding had been repeatedly cut.

Her health was also deteriorating.

Not a single student could take on a major role.

Professor Eleanor Watson couldn't help but sigh.

Victoria Lowell happened to be walking towards her from the opposite direction.

"Good afternoon, Professor Watson. I heard your group has a new discovery?"

Eleanor remained silent.

"It seems the news was false. You're in the lab every day, yet you produce no results."

"Your funding was cut again this year, wasn't it? I've been through those lean times myself. I used to envy you back then."

"Now the tables have turned. Finally, it's my turn." A smirk tugged at Victoria's lips. "It's just unfortunate for you."

Eleanor adjusted her shawl.

"Ten years ago, funding was only one-tenth of what it is now. Yet the entire institute's output was double what it is today. The amount of resources and academic output are not necessarily correlated."

She changed her tone. "Though some people have corrupted the atmosphere, making the institute spend a fortune on a pile of worthless results."

Victoria's face instantly darkened.

"What's the use of being stubborn? If this continues, your entire research group will be disbanded!"

"All these years, I haven't seen you mentor any outstanding students. You know better than I do how important a talented and hardworking disciple is. One could even say an academic successor."

Victoria raised an eyebrow. "I have one. Do you?"

Eleanor calmly retorted, "How do you know I don't?"

"Where is he? I don't see anyone. Stop pretending." Victoria sighed lightly. "Retire early. You might still preserve some dignity."

Eleanor looked at her quietly, a trace of pity in her eyes.

Her research progress was indeed slow, but it was far from the dire situation the other described.

Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad.

It was a pity some people didn't understand this principle.

…

Mid-April brought gradually warmer weather.

Although Sophia Sullivan had secured her graduate position, she didn't relax at all.

Her life revolved around three points: the library, home, and the grocery market.

Besides reading papers, her greatest pleasure was cooking delicious meals for herself.

Occasionally, she would run into Alexander Laurent and invite him to share.

But such opportunities were rare.

He practically lived in the laboratory and seldom came home.

The few times they met were when he returned to pick up clean clothes, or when the lab's rest area was occupied.

Time passed day by day.

Sophia's days were monotonous yet fulfilling.

She no longer waited daily for a man who didn't see her to come home.

She didn't prepare food and drinks for him or manage his trivial matters.

She didn't absorb his negative emotions or internalize them.

Having experienced it, she cherished her current life all the more.

Daily video calls with her parents in the neighboring city became a routine.

After moving into their new home, David Sullivan had completely let loose.

He was now growing everything he had wanted to but couldn't or didn't dare to before.

The first thing he did after class every day was to check on his flowers, plants, and various fruits and vegetables.

In their video calls, Isabella would complain, "Your father is living a purely rural life now. The only thing missing is carrying manure for fertilizer."

David would shout from afar, "I'm happy with it!"

Isabella had found new inspiration and was immersed in her writing.

However, her latest concept was rejected by her editor again.

They had argued several times.

David said Isabella secretly cried while holding her previously published novels late at night.

Hearing this, Sophia gently furrowed her brow.
###Chapter 103

Sophia Sullivan had a plan.

She just needed to wait for the right moment.

Everything would proceed smoothly once the contract expired.

...

Early in the morning, Sophia prepared to go to the library.

She had just stepped out of her building when she ran into Alexander Laurent.

He had been busy with a new research project, pulling all-nighters, and was just returning from the lab.

"...Professor Laurent, good morning," Sophia greeted him with a smile.

"You can call me by my name in private," Alexander said gently.

"There's something I wanted to ask you. Do you remember the research project I mentioned before?"

Sophia nodded.

Of course she remembered.

That project aligned perfectly with her research interests.

It was a shame such a meticulously designed project had been abandoned midway.

Alexander asked, "Have you thought about it? Would you like to continue?"

Sophia didn't hesitate. "I want to continue. But I don't have access to a lab. I can't complete the data section..."

All conclusions required data support.

And data came from repeated experiments.

She lacked the necessary materials and equipment.

Alexander said, "You can use my lab."

He paused. "Free of charge."

His lab was newly established, but it had advanced equipment and was fully stocked.

"Really?" Sophia's eyes widened.

She couldn't believe such good fortune had fallen into her lap.

Alexander asked, "Do I look like I'm joking?"

She hesitated for only two seconds before nodding eagerly.

"That's wonderful! Thank you!"

The corners of Alexander's lips lifted, his eyes smiling.

The lab was located on the eighth floor of the Maxwell Dworkin Building.

Lab resources at MIT were tight, with limited spots available for each research group.

But Alexander's lab was special.

It was a direct collaboration with a corporation, funded entirely by the company.

The university only provided the space, while the academic成果 belonged to the school.

This directly impacted the university's rankings.

Financial independence, combined with academic advantages, meant Alexander's lab occupied an entire floor with first-rate facilities.

Many research groups had requested to use it, but were all refused.

Some professors even offered to pay to share the space, but he firmly declined.

Now, he was inviting Sophia to use it for free.

Sophia was unaware she was receiving special treatment.

She simply thought Professor Laurent was a very kind man.

...

On her first day at the lab, Sophia arrived promptly at eight.

Alexander came to greet her personally.

"Good morning."

Sophia smiled. "You're even earlier."

He had been sleeping at the lab for the past few days.

The break room was equipped with a shower.

Alexander's shirt was crisp and clean. Though he looked tired, his eyes were clear and alert, with no hint of dishevelment.

"I brought you breakfast."

Crab roe buns and soy milk.

Offering his lab for free and personally greeting her made her breakfast gift seem insignificant.

But it was the thought that counted.

Alexander didn't mind these things.

He took it with a smile. "Thank you."

...

At eight-twenty, Alexander took Sophia to change into a lab coat and register her fingerprint and iris scan.

After this, she could come and go freely.

The metal doors slid open to both sides.

Sophia followed him inside, looking around curiously.

Alexander said, "Lab hours are flexible. No need to clock in. Just come whenever you have time."

Sophia needed to study Professor Watson's thesis materials, keep up with the latest research, and now she had this new project. She was very busy.

But Alexander believed she could manage her time well.

He explained the lab rules and precautions in detail.

Different labs had different requirements. Sophia listened carefully and took notes.

"...Currently, only my research group uses this lab. Besides me, there are four other members. I'll introduce you when I get the chance..."

Before he could finish, a bespectacled middle-aged man emerged from the break room.

He was tall and muscular, like a sturdy black bear.

He held a thermos cup with goji berries floating in it, steam rising.

"Oh? Alex, a new member?" The man's gaze fell on Sophia, curious but restrained.

Polite and measured.

Alexander said, "This is Quincy Evans, a colleague and member of my group. He teaches Fundamental Physics at MIT."

"Hello." The man smiled warmly and extended his hand. His square face gave him a honest, good-natured appearance, as if 'reliable' was written all over him.

Sophia was slightly surprised, then shook his hand. "Professor Evans, hello. I'm Sophia Sullivan. I'm Professor Laurent's..."

She hesitated.

"Friend."

Quincy raised an eyebrow, glanced at Alexander, then back at Sophia.

He had never seen Alex bring a 'friend' to the lab before...

"Don't be nervous. Just call me Quincy. We don't stand on ceremony here. We're all friends, haha..."

Sophia still addressed him politely. "Professor Evans."

By nine, the other three members had arrived.

Zoe Langley arrived first, wearing a sweatshirt, jeans, and sneakers—a casual outfit.

Sophia thought she was around her own age, but learned through conversation that Zoe was 38, with a son in elementary school.

After getting her PhD, Zoe stayed on at the university. She originally researched Applied Physics as a postdoctoral fellow before joining Alexander's group.

Her life revolved around three points: family, school, and the lab.

Her only hobby was watching shows on her tablet while waiting for data.

A few days ago, her son had a fever. She went home to care for him for two days before rushing back.

Simon Lowell arrived next, yawning as he entered.

He had been modifying data and needed assistance from a computational experimental group downstairs. He spent two days there and had just returned with the results.

His own lab was still the best.

The environment downstairs was poor, with shared restrooms and unpleasant odors.

He paused upon entering. "Oh, a new member?"

The man was in his early thirties, about 180cm tall, with handsome features. His eyes showed a flash of admiration upon seeing Sophia. He extended his hand. "Hello, Simon Lowell. Welcome aboard. Everyone in the group is easy to get along with. Feel free to ask if you have any questions."

Sophia shook his hand warmly. "Thank you."

The sound of high heels announced the arrival of the final member.
###Chapter 104

A pair of long legs entered her field of vision first.

A camel coat paired with a white knit sweater.

Tall boots hugged slender ankles.

She carried an elephant gray Hermès Picotin Lock Bag.

Every detail exuded refinement.

Lillian Lopez's eyes lit up when she saw Alexander Laurent.

Good morning, Professor Laurent.

Morning. Alexander gave a slight nod.

Lillian, this is our new team member, Sophia Sullivan. Simon Lowell introduced her.

She's two years younger than you.

Lillian finally noticed the extra person in the lab.

Her smile vanished instantly.

Before Sophia arrived, she was the youngest in the group.

Everyone doted on her.

She had the credentials to be spoiled.

A Columbia University master's graduate.

Currently a Ph.D. candidate at MIT.

Her academic credentials were impressive.

Her ability to join Alexander Laurent's research team spoke volumes about her talent.

Sophia extended her hand in greeting.

Lillian raised an eyebrow.

Her fingertips barely brushed Sophia's before pulling away.

The dismissive attitude was obvious.

Sophia sensed the underlying hostility.

Zoe Langley's gaze shifted between the two women.

She remained silent.

Alexander corrected them.

Sophia is not an official team member.

She has her own independent research project.

She is just borrowing lab space.

Borrowing space?

Simon looked surprised.

Professor Laurent never lent out his lab.

He was making an exception?

Zoe and Quincy Evans exchanged a look.

Lillian frowned deeply.

…

Alexander led Sophia to a separate lab bench.

This will be your station from now on.

Request anything you need directly.

Or write it on the blackboard.

Logistics replenishes supplies daily.

Sophia nodded.

A blackboard was embedded in the upper left wall.

A chart for clocking in and notes.

Six blank spaces.

One of them already had her name written in it.

Lillian spoke up suddenly.

Which postdoctoral fellowship are you at, Sophia?

Sophia answered frankly.

I'm just starting my first year of graduate school in September.

You just got into grad school?

Lillian couldn't hide her surprise.

An independent project right after undergrad?

And Professor Laurent made an exception for her?

What's her background?

The surname Sullivan…

Influential families in the area…

None of the major academic dynasties were named Sullivan.

What gave her the right?

Lillian wanted to press further.

Zoe grabbed her arm.

She shook her head slightly.

A silent warning to drop it.

That lab bench was empty anyway.

Professor Laurent had the right to decide who used it.

The lab was Alexander Laurent's personal domain.

They had no right to question his decisions.

Lillian lowered her eyes.

Alexander wore his lab coat.

His figure was tall and slender.

His profile looked gentle in the light.

But she knew that was an illusion.

Alexander's mind held only space for research.

Nothing else.

Lending lab space was a trivial matter.

He wouldn't pay it any mind.

Even if she asked.

Alexander might not even respond.

He brought her here.

He lent her the bench.

The others had no grounds to object.

…

Sophia didn't notice any of this.

She quickly got to work.

She re-planned her workflow based on early data.

Selected her controlled variables.

She was so focused she ignored the footsteps around her.

The lab was quiet.

Everyone was immersed in their work.

Occasional conversation murmured.

It soon faded back into silence.

Alexander broke the silence that afternoon.

It's been a while since we had a group dinner.

My treat tonight.

Zoe and Simon exchanged a glance.

This was unbelievable.

Workaholic Alexander Laurent was initiating a social gathering?

Was the sun rising in the west?

Their eyes swept over Sophia.

Her arrival was the only change today.

This Sophia Sullivan was not simple.

Zoe's husband was back from his business trip.

Someone could watch the kids.

She agreed readily.

Perfect for a welcome dinner for Sophia.

Quincy smiled and agreed.

Zoe's right.

We'll definitely come if you're buying.

Simon nodded excitedly.

A rare treat from Professor Laurent.

We can't miss it.

Lillian closed her laptop.

Her voice was cold.

I have data to process.

Working late.

I won't be going.

Sophia looked up.

A shadow fell over Lillian's pretty oval face.
###Chapter 105
Sunlight streamed through the glass window, spilling onto the metal lab bench.

Lillian Lopez stood to the side with her arms crossed, her gaze cold.

Several colleagues exchanged uneasy glances, the atmosphere growing tense.

Simon Lowell cleared his throat softly and leaned closer to Lillian. "Your data set won't be ready until tomorrow at the earliest. How about joining us for dinner?"

Lillian turned her face away without responding.

Simon added, "Professor Laurent rarely has free time. This is a rare opportunity."

At the mention of Professor Laurent, a flicker of interest passed through Lillian's eyes.

She glanced toward the tall, straight-backed figure by the window.

Alexander Laurent was adjusting his cuff, his profile sharp and severe.

Lillian finally relented. "Fine."

Simon let out a sigh of relief.

…

The bistro was filled with enticing aromas.

Zoe Langley excitedly flipped through the menu. "The Sichuan cuisine here is incredibly authentic!"

Simon warmly urged Sophia Sullivan. "Order anything you like. Professor Laurent is treating us."

Zoe teased with a laugh, "Simon isn't exaggerating this time."

Simon dramatically clutched his chest. "Zoe, give me some credit here!"

Everyone laughed.

Sophia offered a faint smile and picked up the glass of plum juice beside her.

Only Lillian remained silent, her expression cold.

Simon pushed the menu toward her. "They have a non-spicy braised fish. Would you like to try it?"

Lillian frowned. "I can order for myself."

But she took the menu anyway.

Zoe leaned closer to Sophia, lowering her voice. "Simon has been pursuing Lillian for a long time. Have you noticed?"

Sophia gave a slight nod.

"By the way, do you have a boyfriend?" Zoe suddenly asked.

Alexander Laurent, sitting nearby, paused slightly.

"No," Sophia replied succinctly.

Zoe looked surprised but tactfully didn't press further.

Dishes began arriving at the table.

Quincy Evans picked up a piece of scallion oil chicken and praised it enthusiastically. "This flavor is absolutely authentic!"

Simon also tried a bite and said to Lillian, "We can come back when you're not watching your weight."

Lillian shot him a glare. "Who said I'd come with you?"

Zoe turned to Sophia, curious. "How old are you? Twenty-two? Twenty-three?"

Sophia answered calmly, "Twenty-six."

The table suddenly fell silent.

A twenty-six-year-old graduate student?

Lillian raised an eyebrow, a sarcastic smile playing on her lips. "How many times did you take the entrance exam?"

Sophia's expression remained unchanged. "Once."

Lillian scoffed. "If it was so simple, why didn't you take it earlier?"

Sophia replied evenly, "I declined the combined Bachelor's, Master's, and Ph.D. program after my undergraduate studies. I regret it now."

Lillian laughed outright. "MIT doesn't offer a combined Bachelor's, Master's, and Ph.D. program except in Medicine."

She looked at Quincy Evans. "Professor Evans, isn't that right?"

Quincy hesitated. "To my knowledge... that is correct."

Lillian looked at Sophia triumphantly.

Sophia remained composed. "Not a combined Master's and Ph.D. program. A combined Bachelor's, Master's, and Ph.D. program."

Lillian sneered. "Piling lie upon lie?"
Zoe Langley suddenly spoke up.
"A combined Bachelor's to Ph.D. program? MIT does offer that for some majors, but the bar is extremely high."
She looked at Sophia Sullivan.
###Chapter 106
"Sophia, what was your undergraduate major?"

"Bioinformatics."

"School of Life Sciences?" Zoe turned to Simon Lowell.
"You should know. Does that major have a combined program?"

All eyes, including Lillian Lopez's, focused on Simon.

Simon put down his chopsticks.
"Generally speaking, no…"

Lillian shot to her feet.
She glared coldly at Sophia Sullivan.
"Now what do you have to say for yourself?!"

Zoe noticed Simon's wording.
"What do you mean, 'generally speaking'? Are there exceptions?"

Simon nodded.
"Every year, the School of Life Sciences has one or two 'conditional admission slots' for gold medalists from the International Science Olympiad."

"What's a 'conditional admission slot'?"

"It means gold medalists can negotiate terms with the school. Things like scholarships, guaranteed grad school admission. The school will consider any request, but whether they agree is another matter."

Zoe pressed, "So a direct Ph.D. admission could be negotiated?"

Simon replied, "In principle, yes. But it's very difficult. In the last twenty years, the School of Life Sciences has only granted two direct Ph.D. admissions."

"One was for Caleb Watson, a student of Professor Victoria Lowell. The other was a female student of Professor Eleanor Watson. She won gold medals in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Informatics—a grand slam. The school offered her a fast track, but she declined. She took the entrance exam instead and got in as the top science scorer that year."

"A student that exceptional, the school would agree to almost any condition she proposed."

The possibilities narrowed immediately.

Caleb Watson was male, so Sophia Sullivan could only be Professor Eleanor Watson's student…

But was that possible?

Four gold medals. Top science scorer. Combined Bachelor's to Ph.D. program. The school's favorite…

None of these identities seemed to fit Sophia Sullivan.

Lillian snorted lightly.
"Speechless now, I see?"

Sophia Sullivan truly had nothing to say, because she was rendered speechless.

Alexander Laurent set down his chopsticks.
He spoke calmly.
"Sophia Sullivan is Professor Eleanor Watson's student."

Silence fell over the table.

Simon swallowed hard.
"No way…" He looked at Sophia Sullivan.
"You're really that student of Professor Watson's?!"

Sophia Sullivan sighed.
"Do I need to call Professor Watson right now to verify?"

"No, no, no…" Simon waved his hands hurriedly.
"It's not that I don't believe you! I'm just shocked! I never thought the legendary prodigy was right here beside me…"

Zoe excitedly grabbed Sophia Sullivan's hand.
"Tell me, how did you get four gold medals? My kid complains non-stop just studying for one math Olympiad."

Sophia Sullivan looked slightly embarrassed.
"Well… you just do the problems. A lot of them. And get them all right."

Zoe was speechless.

Humblebrag! Such a humblebrag!

Quincy Evans hadn't expected such a big revelation over dinner.
"So you're the female student Professor Watson always mentions with 'lingering regret'! Who did you choose as your graduate advisor this year?"

Sophia Sullivan answered, "Professor Eleanor Watson."

Quincy clapped his hands together.
"The old lady will be over the moon!"

Lillian remained standing.
The smug look on her face had frozen into awkwardness.

Simon quickly offered her a way out.
"Lillian, sit down first. What would you like to eat? I'll get it for you. The vegetarian dishes are all on my side…"

"Thank you," Lillian said, sitting down.

Simon looked at Sophia Sullivan with an apologetic expression.
"Sorry, Sophia. Lillian can be a bit… meticulous. But she means no harm. You'll understand once you get to know her better."

No harm?
Sophia Sullivan raised a delicate eyebrow.
She could only hope so.

Simon continued, "I apologize on her behalf. Please don't take it to heart."

"Who said you could apologize for me?!" Lillian stomped hard on his foot under the table.

Simon's face turned red with suppressed pain.

Zoe gave him a sympathetic glance.

Sophia Sullivan spoke evenly.
"I won't take it to heart."

Simon nodded, relieved.
"That's good. I'm curious, why did you give up the guaranteed admission and choose to take the entrance exam? You ended up at MIT anyway. Since the destination was the same, why not take the easier path?"

Sophia Sullivan thought for a moment.
"Maybe… because I spent three years in high school? Wanted to test my exam-taking ability?"

"That's it?"

"…Do I need another reason?"

Simon was speechless.
Alright then. She just took the exam for fun.

With the misunderstanding cleared, the atmosphere relaxed.

Everyone chatted and laughed as they ate.

Quincy noticed a slight upward curve on Alexander Laurent's lips.

Suddenly, he understood.
Alexander hadn't stepped in because he already knew Sophia Sullivan could handle it herself.

Lillian had no appetite.
Seeing everyone chatting happily with Sophia Sullivan, she pursed her lips tightly.

She was about to say something when Zoe subtly patted her hand.
"Alright, let's not talk about unpleasant things. Don't waste Simon's thoughtful gesture…"

Simon quickly placed two pieces of fish into Lillian's bowl.
"This is delicious. It won't make you gain weight, and I've picked out all the bones."

By the time they finished, it was dark outside.

Alexander checked the time.
"It's late. We all have work tomorrow. Time to head back."

Simon and Lillian were going the same way.
They had both drunk beer and couldn't drive.

Simon said, "I called a ride. It'll be here soon. I'll see Lillian home. Zoe, you—"

Zoe waved him off.
"Don't worry about me. My husband is picking me up."

Quincy said, "I live nearby. Just a ten-minute walk."

Alexander nodded.
"Good. Everyone message when you get home."

"Don't worry. Same as always, we'll check in." Quincy smiled.

A valet brought Alexander's car around—a black Volkswagen.

Alexander took the keys.
He looked naturally at Sophia Sullivan.
"Get in."

They lived close by, and Alexander often gave Sophia Sullivan a ride.

Sophia Sullivan was used to catching rides with him.
She opened the passenger door and got in.

The car pulled away and merged into the main road.

Those left behind stood stunned, as if they'd seen a ghost.
###Chapter 107

What did that mean?

The familiar tone suggested they were already inseparable.

They might even be living under the same roof...

Zoe Langley watched the car disappear into the distance, then slowly turned back and pinched Simon Lowell hard. "Simon, am I seeing things?"

Simon sucked in a sharp breath. "...Zoe, next time, could you pinch yourself?"

Why was he always the one suffering!

Zoe said matter-of-factly, "You're young. You recover quickly. What's a little pinch?"

Simon: "..." Thank you so much.

Professor Quincy Evans chuckled, hands behind his back, and ambled slowly toward home.

Lillian Lopez's face was so dark it looked like it could drip water. She didn't wait for Simon, just yanked the car door open and left.

Simon lowered his eyes, hiding the flicker of disappointment in them.

It was fine. He was used to it.

He told himself that sincerity could move even metal and stone. One day...

She would understand his feelings.

...

Alexander Laurent and Sophia Sullivan were completely unaware of all this.

The car entered the residential complex, and they walked upstairs one after the other.

The motion-sensor lights flickered on and off with their footsteps. Sophia watched the man's tall, straight back. The light stretched their shadows, making them overlap and merge. For a fleeting moment, it felt like they had known each other for a long time.

"Thank you for today."

Her voice was soft, but it was exceptionally clear in the quiet stairwell.

Alexander seemed to be in a good mood today. She couldn't see his expression, but she could hear the relaxation in his tone. "For driving you home? Or for dinner?"

Sophia: "Both. Thank you for dinner, thank you for the ride, and thank you most of all for lending me your lab."

And for that sentence at the dinner table: "Sophia Sullivan is Professor Eleanor Watson's student."

On the seventh floor, Alexander stopped.

He turned to watch her, slightly out of breath, climb the last step and walk over to stand beside him.

"I know what you want to say. A pearl covered in dust is still a pearl. Once the dust is brushed away, its shine will return."

Sophia's heart trembled slightly. She looked up and met his gaze directly.

Alexander said, word by word, "The future is unpredictable, but the present can be grasped. It might be a little late, but I still want to say: welcome to my lab."

A smile touched the man's eyes as he held out his hand.

Sophia's eyes curved. She gently returned the handshake. "Thank you. I don't think it's late at all."

It was perfect.

...

After agreeing to go together the next day, they each went home.

Sophia took a shower, reviewed some materials, and went to sleep.

Early the next morning, she made two sandwiches. Her own had extra cream, while Alexander's had less cream and more vegetables.

She still had some beans, so she made two cups of unsweetened soy milk. Paired with the sandwiches, it was a nutritious and healthy breakfast.

At exactly seven o'clock, Alexander knocked on the door.

After breakfast, they went to the lab together.

It was still early when they arrived. Sophia and Alexander changed into their lab coats and went to their respective workstations to start their busy day.

By eight o'clock, the others had arrived one after another.

Zoe put down her bag, changed her clothes, and went over to Sophia's side for a look. "You're already halfway through the experiment? That's efficient. What time did you get here?"

Sophia's hands never stopped moving. Her eyes were fixed intently on the test tube as she recorded data. 
###Chapter 108

"Half an hour ago. Zoe, could you take a look and see if this ratio is appropriate?"

Zoe, hearing a professional question, didn't hold back. After understanding the experimental steps, she quickly offered suggestions for adjustments.

Lillian saw how serious Sophia looked the moment she arrived and couldn't help but curl her lip. What real skill could an undergraduate possibly have?

Putting on airs!

Sophia worked through the entire morning. When she finally looked up, she realized everyone had already left their stations, probably gone for lunch and a break.

Checking the time, she saw there was an hour and a half for the break. She planned to grab a quick bite and then return to continue the experiment.

Just as she stepped out the door, she saw Alexander walking toward her with a takeout bag.

"I went downstairs to get lunch and brought you a portion."

Seeing he only had one bag, she guessed he had already eaten.

"Thank you."

After eating lunch in the break room, she made a cup of coffee to perk herself up.

She had adjusted the ratio of the reaction materials based on Zoe's suggestion that morning, but the results were still not ideal.

This set of data was sufficient to support the conclusion in her paper, but Sophia believed the accuracy could be improved further.

This meant the experiment needed to be redone.

At this moment, she was immensely grateful to Alexander for lending her the lab. With these resources, she wasn't afraid of having to redo it multiple times.

Thinking of this, Sophia finished her coffee in a few gulps and prepared to return to her workstation.

As soon as she entered, she saw Zoe, Quincy, Simon, and Lillian gathered together discussing something.

She was about to greet them when she noticed that as she approached, the group automatically dispersed and quickly returned to their respective places.

Sophia was taken aback for a moment, but she didn't dwell on it and threw herself back into her experiment.

Different circles don't have to mix.

People naturally have different thoughts and values.

It's like a hunter and a woodcutter. One tracks prey, the other gathers firewood.

Their goals are different; they cannot walk the same path.

If they meet by chance and get along well, they can travel together for a while. If they part ways, there's no need for regret. Everyone has their own destination.

Everything should be left to nature.

The experiment had to be started over, and time was tight.

Sophia was responsible for both sampling and data collection and analysis, essentially doing the work of an entire team by herself.

What could she do? She was a one-woman army.

When things got busy, she spent sixteen out of twenty-four hours in the lab.

The days passed. Zoe and Quincy occasionally came over to chat.

Simon sought out Lillian to talk whenever he had a free moment, so he didn't interact much with Sophia.

As for Lillian, ever since that awkward dinner, she hadn't initiated a conversation with Sophia.

Most of the time, Sophia was alone.

...

After working non-stop for a week, Sophia finally found some time to rest. Looking down, she realized her clothes were wrinkled.

Although the lab had a break room and showers, she hadn't anticipated being this busy and had only brought two changes of clothes. She decided to take some time to go back home today.

The succulents on the balcony were thriving, but the orchid had already wilted.

She added feed to the small fish in the aquarium, did a quick clean of the room, packed some clean clothes, and prepared to return to the lab.

Suddenly, her phone rang.

Seeing the name on the caller ID, Sophia's heart skipped a beat.
Sophia Sullivan's phone screen lit up.

Olivia Lopez's name flashed repeatedly.

She swiped to answer.

"Sophia Sullivan! How dare you ignore my calls?!"

Olivia's furious shout came through the receiver.

Sophia held the phone away from her ear.

She checked her call log.

A string of missed calls.

All from Olivia.

She had been swamped these past few days.

She meant to call back several times.

But kept forgetting.

"Sorry, Liv." Sophia's tone was apologetic. "The lab's been crazy."

Olivia snorted.

"My birthday is next month." She emphasized, "You have to come."

Sophia chuckled softly. "Of course I remember."

The gift had been ready for a while.

Olivia seemed satisfied.

The call ended.

Sophia returned to the lab.

She heard a groan as soon as she entered.

Simon Lowell was frantically tugging at his hair.

"Why won't it compute?!"

He was staring miserably at the data on his screen.

Professor Quincy Evans adjusted his glasses.

"The third node might be the issue." He pointed at the screen. "The steps aren't clear."

Simon wailed, "I've run it eight times!"

Dr. Zoe Langley leaned over to look.

"The third node is fine." She offered a different opinion. "The formula can be simplified."

Lillian Lopez picked up a pen.

She circled several data points.

After recalculating, she arrived at a new answer.

"Is this correct?"

Zoe nodded. "That should be it."

But Quincy frowned. "It still doesn't match up."

Sophia happened to walk by.

She glanced at the screen.

"The two data points in the seventh row are wrong." She said quietly. "It's not 50 and 71."

The lab fell silent.

Four pairs of eyes turned to her.

Lillian was the first to scoff.

"You understand physics?" Her tone was mocking. "Stop pretending you know what you're talking about."

Zoe tried to mediate.

"Sophia, we've all double-checked this data." She said tactfully. "You might be mistaken."

Quincy also nodded. "Professor Laurent and I have verified it."

Lillian cut in directly.

"Do you even know how different biology and physics are?" She sneered. "Don't interrupt with uninformed comments."

Sophia frowned. "I can explain—"

"Explain what?" Lillian's voice rose. "Think your high school competition gold medal makes you an expert?"

"This isn't a competition." Her tone was sharp. "Scientific research requires rigor."

Zoe seemed to want to say something.

But remained silent in the end.

Perhaps it was good for the newbie to learn a lesson.
###Chapter 109

Qian Xuyang remained silent.

He chose to observe.

Lillian Lopez sneered.
"Some people need to know their place."
"A biology major, lecturing on physics data?"
"It's laughable."

Simon Lowell slammed the table.

His eyes lit up.
"Sophia Sullivan is right!"

Lillian's voice caught in her throat.

Zoe Langley and Qian Xuyang froze simultaneously.

Simon pointed excitedly at the screen.
"Not 50 and 71. It's 50.2!"
"That tiny deviation caused all anomalies after the seventh node."

Scientific research tolerates no error.

Qian Xuyang immediately stepped forward.

He recalculated.

With the corrected values, all anomalies vanished.

He exclaimed, "It really was the seventh node!"

Zoe confirmed it too.

Her gaze toward Sophia Sullivan completely changed.

Surprise, shame, and a hint of admiration.

She had chosen silence earlier.

Simon spoke fervently.
"Sophia, we owe you!"
"This data stalled us for three days."
"Without you, who knows how much more time we'd waste."

Sophia's expression remained calm.

As if the earlier doubts never happened.

"Just luck."
"Professor Qian would have found it soon anyway."

She wasn't being modest.

This team was highly capable.

Discovering the issue was only a matter of time.

Zoe's eyes were complex.

She had to admit she'd underestimated this girl.

The lab members possessed inherent pride.

Sophia only had a bachelor's degree, not yet in grad school.

Her major was biology.

They naturally looked down on her.

Plus, her unclear relationship with Professor Alexander Laurent.

It made people reluctant to get close.

Only now did Zoe realize her mistake.

Lillian was the most embarrassed.

Her earlier words were harsh. Now her face stung.

She never expected Sophia to be right.

How could an outsider correct a professional error?

It was absurd!

Sophia looked at Lillian.

Her tone was calm yet sharp.
"Thanks for the lesson, Senior."
"Research requires rigor, but also listening."
"Any correction should be verified before conclusions, not judged by personal feeling."

Each word pierced.

Lillian's cheeks burned.

…

The night was deep.

Sophia dragged her exhausted body home.

She collapsed on the sofa, hugging a pillow, falling into a deep sleep.

Under the same night sky.

Some slept. Some reveled.

Deafening music. Dazzling lights.

Young bodies swayed wildly on the dance floor.

Julian Winston held a glass, his gaze roaming.

Like a hunting black panther.

Charlie Lowell approached with a drink.
"Thought you were playing cards? Scared to lose?"

Julian raised an eyebrow.
"Big brother never fears losing."
"Luck's good tonight. Several girls are my type. More fun than cards."

He blew a kiss to a girl in a black halter top.

Charlie shook his head.
"Careful you don't catch something."

"Relax. I know my limits." Julian took a sip.
"Is he still moping in there?"

Charlie sighed.
"You'd feel the pressure too."

Julian gloated.
"It's great! A ready-made kid delivered."
"My mom nags me daily for a grandson."

Charlie glared.
"If Ethan hears that, he might dump the kid on you. And the mother."

Julian's face paled.
"Don't! I wouldn't want that 'blessing' if you paid me!"

He wanted no part of a gold digger's trap.

Fun was fine, but no accidents.

If something happened, his father would break his legs.

Charlie started to say more.

The private room door opened.

Ethan Roscente walked out, carrying his coat.

"Charlie, get someone to drive me home."
###Chapter 110

Ethan stared at his phone screen, his brow furrowed.

In just two hours, he had received five calls from home.
Three were from his mother.
Two were from Isabella.

He hadn't answered a single one.

Isabella knew her place.
She only called once and didn't bother him again.

But her restraint only irritated him more.

The villa now housed someone who shouldn't be there.
The very air felt suffocating.

Charlie swirled his glass and approached.
"Leaving already? It's only nine."

Ethan remained silent.
His gaze was cold enough to freeze.

Charlie wisely shut up.

Ethan seemed sober, but his simmering rage was palpable.

"My driver is downstairs. Let him take you."

"Thanks."

"Don't mention it." Charlie set down his glass.
"I'll walk you out."

Ethan waved him off and strode out directly.

Julian watched his retreating back and snorted.

"Play with fire, get burned. Isabella really has talent, pushing him to this state."

Charlie sighed.
"Enough. He's upset."

"Who wouldn't be? Threw away a gem for a pebble, only to get hurt by the pebble. I heard Sophia got into MIT for her Master's. She's cut off love, focusing on her studies now…"

"We bet on how long Sophia would make a scene, but she didn't even bother. Just started a whole new life. Tsk tsk…"

Julian was used to their on-and-off drama.
###Chapter 111
He never thought they'd really end.

Sophia endured for six years, almost reaching the finish line.
Who knew she'd flip the game at the last moment?

Honestly, he used to look down on Sophia.

No spine. Came and went at Ethan's beck and call.

Now he realized she wasn't a dog, but a wolf.

One move set two men against each other, now avoiding each other like plague, completely severed.

Had to admit, the woman had skills…

Julian pulled out his phone.
"Call Sebastian. Tell him Ethan left."

Charlie quickly shook his head.
"You call. If they run into each other, it'll be explosive. I don't dare."

"Coward!" Julian dialed directly.

"Seb, come out."

A low voice replied.
"No."

"Ethan just left. You won't bump into him."

"It's not because of him."

Julian paused.
"Then why?"

Sebastian: "No bars. No late nights. No unnecessary drinking. Upholding male virtue."

Julian: "???"

Was he possessed?

Male virtue?

"Are you okay?"

Sebastian: "I've settled down."

"?"

"Serious."

"... Because of Sophia?"

"Yes."

…

In the car, Ethan closed his eyes, massaging his temples.

The AC was too high.
He lowered the window.
Cold wind rushed in.
Streetlights flickered across his profile.

But the restlessness in his heart didn't lessen at all.

Victoria firmly opposed his breakup with Isabella.
A week ago, she directly hired two nannies and moved Isabella into the villa to "rest."

Under the guise of care, it was surveillance.

When he found out Isabella had secretly approached his mother, he lost his temper.

They agreed: take the money, abort, clean break.
###Chapter 112

This woman dared to double-cross him, going through his mother to successfully install herself.

Ethan realized too late that Isabella was far more calculating than he imagined.

The purity and innocence he thought she had were all an act.

He was completely fooled, even lost Sophia because of it.

If not for her, how could things with Sophia have come to this?

The thought deepened the disgust in his eyes.
He refused to set foot anywhere she was.

He'd been sleeping at the company for days.
Isabella didn't dare approach him directly, so she pressured him incessantly through Victoria.

To placate his mother, he had to return to the villa.

But that was it.

…

10 PM.
The villa was brightly lit.

He pushed the door open.
Isabella stood in the foyer, reaching for his coat.

Ethan sidestepped her and walked straight to the living room.

Isabella's hands hung awkwardly in the air.
She bit her lip.

She wore a light-colored knit dress, hair cascading over her shoulders, looking gentle and harmless.

Ethan ignored her completely.
He addressed Victoria.
"You wanted me back. I'm back."

He turned to go upstairs.

"Stop."

Ethan paused.
"I'm tired. I need to rest."

Victoria frowned.
"Come here. I need to talk to you."

Her tone was firm.
Ethan followed with a dark expression.

In the study, he poured himself water, completely ignoring his mother's grim face.

"The child is yours. Can't you show some concern?"

Victoria knew her son too well.
Beneath the perfect exterior was utter coldness.

He loved fiercely, hated intensely.

"When did I ever say I wanted this child? Didn't you force it on me?"

His brows were sharp, eyes full of loathing.

Victoria understood his resentment, but she would never give up her grandchild.

"Whatever you think, Isabella is carrying the Roscente heir. Since I know about it, it must be born safely!"

Ethan's face turned icy.
"And after it's born? You want me to marry her?"

"I care about the child. Marriage is up to you." Victoria's tone was flat.

Ethan was silent for a moment.
"... Fine. I'll agree, but on one condition."

"Name it."

"After the child is born, Isabella disappears completely. And you won't stop me from being with Sophia."

Victoria was helpless against her son's obsession, but finally nodded.

She wasn't satisfied with Sophia either, but she was much better than Isabella.

At least an MIT graduate, now pursuing a Master's.

Good taste, generous.

Isabella had nothing but a pretty face.

Ethan left the study feeling lighter.

He grabbed his coat, ignored Isabella's pleading look, and strode out.

Right now, he just wanted to see Sophia immediately.

To tell her all obstacles were cleared.

From now on, the path was smooth.
Sophia Sullivan was jolted awake by frantic knocking.

She sat up and listened carefully.

Someone was definitely knocking on her door.

"Who is it?" she called out through the door.

Alexander Laurent was pulling an all-nighter at the lab. If it was a real intruder, she had no backup.

The knocking paused for a moment, but the person outside didn't answer.

Seeing she wouldn't open up, they started knocking again.

"I won't open if you don't speak."

"...Clara." Ethan Roscente's voice held a bitter note.

She was still so stubborn.

"...What do you want?" Hearing his voice, Sophia instinctively frowned.

"Let me in. We need to talk. I promise I won't do anything. You can leave the door ajar..."

"We have nothing to talk about." Sophia cut him off, clearly not intending to open the door.

No matter how he pleaded or knocked after that, Sophia pretended not to hear.

Ethan was uncharacteristically patient today. If she wouldn't open, he would just keep knocking.

Sophia finished her shower. The knocking was still going. She picked up her phone. "Hello, 911? Someone is persistently knocking on my door..."

Ethan was eventually persuaded to leave by the police.

Finally, peace and quiet.

Sophia lay down to sleep.

Early the next morning, she prepared breakfast, packed some clothes, and set off for the lab.

She planned to stay there for the next couple of days.

Partly to avoid further harassment from Ethan, and partly because she genuinely needed to focus.

She had to finish this paper before graduate school started in September.

It killed two birds with one stone.

Unfortunately, the very person she was avoiding darted out from a side alley the moment she left her building, blocking her path.

Sophia was startled.

"Having fun?" Ethan's face was dark as he glared coldly at her.

Sleepless and fresh from a trip to the police station, stubble dotted his once-handsome face. He looked utterly haggard.

His gaze at Sophia was a mix of love and resentment, anger and pity.

"You got me lectured all night. Are you satisfied now?" The words sounded like an accusation, but his tone was soft, almost pleading.

Sophia looked back at him, her eyes calm and unreadable. "First, I'm not playing games. You were genuinely disturbing me. Second, you got that lecture for causing a disturbance in the middle of the night. You deserved it."

"Why wouldn't you open the door?"

Sophia: "I never open the door for strangers."

The word 'strangers' stung. Ethan retorted, "Strangers?! You don't know me? Or I don't know you?! What were those past six years then?"

"You said it yourself. That's the past. Since it's already in the past, don't let it affect the present!"

Ethan: "Do you hate me that much?"

Enough to deny everything they once had.

"No," Sophia shook her head, looking straight into his eyes, enunciating each word clearly. "Hate is built on a foundation of love. You need love to feel hate. But I don't love you anymore."

Right after the breakup, Sophia appeared calm on the surface, but inside, she was full of hate.

She hated his easy betrayal.

She resented how he just ended things.

She mourned their six years together.

But after surviving the hardest part and slowly healing her wounds, thinking of the past now felt like a light boat had already passed countless mountains.

Sophia: "I've moved on. You should accept reality too and live your own life."

"Moved on? How can you just move on?" How could she?!

Ethan suddenly became agitated.

Faced with such unreasonable behavior, Sophia could only find it laughable.

He was the one who let go first. Now, just as she was accepting reality and about to step out of the shadows, he suddenly turns back, trying to drag her into the past?

Wasn't that just hilarious?

"Ethan Roscente, don't pester me anymore. Don't make me despise you."

Her firmness and finality were like a knife, puncturing all his confidence and self-assurance.

"Clara... please don't be like this... okay?"

Sophia just looked at him, her expression unreadable.

"I've cleared all the obstacles between us. My mother has agreed. All you need to do is nod, and we can go to the courthouse to get married right away!"

Sophia: "I don't want to."

And his so-called "solutions" were nothing but self-deception.

"Clara..."

"I'm very busy. I have to go."

With that, she stepped past him and walked away without looking back.

Ethan stood frozen on the spot for a long time.

The morning rush hour crowd flowed around him, but he seemed to have lost his soul. His eyes were dull, watching everything as if the whole world had nothing to do with him.

After who knows how long, the man's rigid eyes moved slightly, looking in the direction Sophia had left. He whispered softly—

"Is there really no chance anymore?"

...

Isabella Langley didn't know what Ethan and Victoria Roscente had discussed in the study that night. Initially, she felt uneasy living there. The man's cold attitude made her feel like she could be thrown out at any moment.

But that anxiety soon faded.

Victoria spoke to her gently and soothingly, calling her the Roscente family's benefactor, and instructed the two housekeepers to take good care of her.

She even spent a fortune buying Isabella many prenatal supplements.

As for Ethan, he seemed to tacitly accept her staying at the mansion, not rejecting it outright like before.

The household staff sensed this shift in attitude and did a complete one-eighty in how they treated Isabella.

Some started addressing her as "Madam" or "Young Mistress."

Whatever she felt like eating, as soon as she mentioned it, someone would prepare it immediately.

Those luxury jewelry and handbags she never dared to dream of before, Victoria would occasionally give them to her.

Isabella lived a life of pampered luxury every day, long forgetting she was still a student. Each day she woke up in a luxurious mansion and ate expensive bird's nest soup.

No wonder every woman dreams of marrying into a wealthy family!

She only blamed herself for not thinking of this trick earlier. If she had gotten pregnant sooner, she wouldn't have wasted all those good days!

If she had one worry now...

Victoria was manageable for the time being. Even if not for her, they'd respect the "baby." They catered to her every whim, so why would they cause trouble?

The main issue was still Ethan's attitude.

The man had gone out that night and hadn't returned. Who knows what he received, but he caught a cold the next day.

He refused to see a doctor.

When a doctor was called to the house, he refused to cooperate.

Like a sulking child, he locked himself in the master bedroom. He stayed there for a full day and night, not eating or drinking. No one knew what he was doing inside.

Isabella had initially thought about going up to comfort him, to show her gentle and caring side.

But before she could even get close, she was frozen by a single look from him.

For a moment, she even felt Ethan looked at her like she was a cockroach—disgusting and despicable.

But很快, his expression returned to normal.

It made her think it might have just been her imagination...

"Baby, are you going out?" Isabella quickly got up from the sofa, fluttering over to the man like a butterfly.

"Don't call me baby. If I hear it one more time, get out!"
The lab was brightly lit.

Zoe Langley rushed over to Quincy Evans with a stack of data. "Quincy, I need these numbers crunched urgently. Do it by hand."

Quincy didn't look up. "Use the computer. I'm busy."

"The computer isn't as fast as you! It'll only take a few minutes!"

Quincy gestured with his chin toward the opposite bench. "Ask Sophia Sullivan. She can do it."

After the last correction, everyone in the lab had witnessed Sophia's ability.

Only Lillian Lopez still thought it was just luck.

"Dr. Langley, need some help?" Sophia offered.

Zoe's eyes lit up. "Yes, please calculate this for me…"

Two minutes later, Sophia looked up. "I've sent the results to your internal email."

Zoe was stunned. "That fast?"

Quincy put down his work and reached for the data. "Let me see that."

Zoe glared at him. "You were too busy to do it a second ago. Now you want to see it after she's finished? Are you messing with me?"

Quincy ignored her, grabbing paper and a pen to calculate.

Simon Lowell immediately pulled out his phone to time it.

"...Done. How long?"

Simon checked the screen. "Two minutes and five seconds."

Almost the same time as Sophia.

Quincy looked at Sophia intently. "Did you formally study speed math?"

Sophia hesitated. "Does mental abacus count?"

"When did you learn it?"

"Five? Or six? I don't really remember." She smiled apologetically.

Quincy took a deep breath. "That's it?"

"Is there more required?" Sophia looked confused.

Quincy was speechless.

Simon was eager. "Professor Evans, I've studied speed math with you for over half a year. How about a contest between me and Sophia?"

Everyone was immediately interested.

Quincy nodded. "Good idea. It'll test your progress."

"I'll set the problems. The winner answers the most correctly in the shortest time, within ten minutes."

Zoe smiled and leaned in. "Let's make it interesting. The loser buys dinner, okay?"

Simon rolled up his sleeves. "Bring it on! Dinner is on me tonight."

A slight smile touched Sophia's lips. "Alright. But I'm afraid you'll be paying, Simon."

Her rare show of confidence excited everyone.

Lillian muttered under her breath, "Such a show-off…"

Only Simon heard her.

Zoe urged, "Hurry up, Quincy. I can't wait."

Quincy's pen flew across the paper, writing five problems in half a minute.

"Ready—begin!"

Sophia scanned the questions. They were pure calculations, testing only speed and accuracy.

By the third minute, Sophia had finished two problems.

Simon was faster, already on the third.

Zoe and Quincy exchanged a look.

Zoe asked, "Who do you think will win?"

Quincy said, "Simon is leading for now."

By the fifth minute, Sophia had done four and started the fifth.

Simon was stuck on the fourth for a few seconds, falling slightly behind.

Sophia had pulled ahead, but her lead was slim.

In the sixth minute, both were stuck on the final problem.

At six minutes and fifty seconds, Sophia wrote down her answer.

Simon was ten seconds behind.

He wiped his brow. "It's fine. We still need to check accuracy. I'm confident."

But the results showed Sophia had all correct. He had one wrong.

Simon was stunned. "How…"

He had to admit it. "Sophia, you're incredible. Really, just mental abacus?"

Quincy nodded to himself.

Not only was Sophia capable, but her composure was rock-solid. She never panicked under pressure.

That alone guaranteed Simon's loss.

Zoe teased, "Well, Simon? Convinced?"

Simon nodded repeatedly. "Convinced, convinced. Results speak for themselves. I have to admit it—"

Losing to Quincy was one thing, but Sophia was just an undergraduate. The result was hard to believe.

Zoe patted his shoulder. "You win some, you lose some. There's always next time. But don't try to skip out on dinner."

Simon said cheerfully, "My treat tonight! But Sophia, how did you solve the last one? It was so fast."

Sophia generously shared her method.

Simon had a sudden realization. "You can calculate it that way?"

"The method isn't important. The correct result is."

"...I see."

Quincy pressed again, "You really never studied speed math formally?"

Sophia shook her head. "No."

She'd realized as a child that her mental math was faster than others. Problems that took minutes for others, she solved instantly.

"I have a set of speed math notes. I compiled them myself. Would you like to see them?"

Zoe was surprised. "Quincy, you never let anyone see those notes. Why the generosity today?"

Quincy said calmly, "Good things should go to those who deserve them."

Sophia was flattered. "Is that appropriate?"

Quincy said, "Just say yes or no!"

Sophia said, "Yes!"

Simon looked at Quincy resentfully. "...Don't I deserve them?"

Oh well. His devotion was misplaced.

Zoe said cheerfully, "Shall we discuss what to eat tonight?"

"Going out to eat?" A cool voice came from the doorway.

Everyone turned.

Alexander Laurent stood there, wearing a shirt and trousers, pulling on his lab coat.
He fastened the buttons as he asked, "Reached a decision? Where are we going?"
###Chapter 113

Prefer the mature type?

He had just finished his class, textbooks still tucked under his arm.

Zoe Langley approached him. "Simon and Sophia had a mental math race. The loser buys dinner. They're deciding where to eat now."

Alexander Laurent's gaze swept over the group, landing on Sophia Sullivan. Her eyes curved into gentle crescents, a soft smile gracing her lips.

The lab atmosphere had never felt this harmonious. She was finally being genuinely accepted.

A slight smile touched Alexander's lips. "We'll finish early today. Let's wait for Simon's treat."

Zoe raised an eyebrow. "Professor, how did you know Simon lost?"

His tone was certain. "Didn't he?"

Zoe chuckled. "You guessed right."

Simon Lowell groaned. "My wallet…"

"Lillian, joining us?" Zoe turned to ask.

Lillian Lopez shook her head. "No."

…

Dinner was at a street-side stall at the alley's entrance.

Zoe, for all her boisterousness, was surprisingly considerate in her choice.

Simon came from a humble background. His farming parents had scraped together money for his education. Things only eased slightly after he got his PhD, and he still sent money home every month.

The stall was cheap, cheerful, and full of life.

It couldn't compare to upscale restaurants, but everyone ate their fill.

On the drive back, Alexander focused on the road.

In his peripheral vision, the girl's eyes sparkled like stars, brimming with happiness.

He smiled lightly. "So happy?"

"Yes. Dr. Langley said 'see you tomorrow' on her own. Professor Evans gave me his mental math notes… They've really accepted me."

Sophia had always been aware of those subtle, unspoken barriers.

Adult boundaries aren't explicitly stated, yet they prick the skin like fine needles.

Today, the ice had finally melted. She had finally touched warmth.

The light turned red. Alexander pressed the brake.

Turning, he met those eyes holding entire galaxies. Almost without thinking, he reached out and ruffled her hair—

"You did well."

His palm met softness, his touch gentle.

The man's gaze was warm, his voice a low murmur like a nocturne.

Sophia looked up abruptly, falling into his deep stare.

She hastily turned away, fingers brushing her burning earlobe.

Alexander withdrew his hand calmly, as if it were merely a teacher's praise for a student.

But the lingering tingle in his palm refused to fade.

"Beep beep—"

A car horn blared from behind.

Sophia whispered a reminder, "It's green, Professor…"

Alexander snapped back to attention and released the brake.

Sophia suddenly glanced sideways. "Why is your face red?"

A blush spread from his cheeks to the tips of his ears in mere seconds.

Alexander gripped the steering wheel tighter. "It's a bit stuffy in here."

Sophia rolled down her window. "Better now?"

"Much better."

…

After dropping Sophia off, Alexander returned to the lab to finish an experiment.

Sophia sank into her sofa, exhaustion washing over her as the excitement faded.

Closing her eyes, she still saw the scene in the car.

The warmth of his fingertips lingered in her hair, so tender it was intoxicating.

Maybe it was more than just encouragement?

But it could only go this far.

Stains from the previous tenant marred the ceiling. Even with wallpaper, the shabbiness showed through.

Just like her own battered life.

Better to keep her distance, to avoid anyone seeing the mess.

She gently touched her chest. Her heartbeat had steadied.

She got up and headed to the bathroom.

A shower and a good sleep. Tomorrow was another day.

She'd leave her troubles for tomorrow.

…

Finally, a weekend off for Sophia.

She hadn't answered Olivia Lopez's call last time, so she specifically asked her out for a movie.

The Spring Festival releases were winding down. They picked the highest-rated comedy.

Olivia was recently obsessed with a minor celebrity who had a cameo, playing a handsome murderer.

Sophia hugged her popcorn and soda as they laughed together.

The movie was great, but the celebrity only appeared for two seconds.

Olivia lamented, "That's it? I gifted 200k in livestream credits for him!"

Sophia comforted her, "Two seconds is still pretty handsome."

Olivia's eyes lit up. "You don't even follow celebrities. Did you take a liking to him? Want me to push his WeChat?"

"He's too young. Not suitable." Sophia brushed her off.

Olivia leaned in. "Not into young ones? So you prefer the mature type?"

Sophia froze, then pushed her friend's nosy face away. "...What nonsense are you talking about?"
###Chapter 114
Olivia Lopez lowered her head to play with her phone.

She didn't dare to meet Sophia Sullivan's eyes.

Sophia stared at her for two seconds.

"Why do you look so guilty?"

Olivia immediately looked up. "Who... Who's guilty? I'm just hungry. Let's go eat!"

A new hot pot place had opened on the Third Ring Road.

They had a limited daily supply.

Olivia had to pull some strings to get a reservation.

The restaurant's decor was simple.

But the beef was sliced fresh.

The broth was simmered with beef bones for eight hours.

It was clear, sweet, and refreshing.

Sophia picked up a slice of beef.

She swished it in the pot for three seconds.

Dipped it in satay sauce.

It was tender and juicy.

Olivia ate ravenously.

She had worked so much overtime this week.

She'd lost three pounds.

She needed to gain it back.

Sophia looked at the table full of meat.

"You ordered this much?"

Olivia bit her chopsticks.

She suddenly remembered something.

"Oh yeah... I just called my brother."

Sophia paused her chopsticks.

Olivia said quietly, "His mom wanted him to come home. He said he was off today, so I... invited him to join us."

She peeked at Sophia.

"You don't mind, do you?"

Sophia lowered her head to drink her soup.

"It's fine."

Alexander Laurent arrived.

It had started raining outside.

His hair was damp.

Water droplets dotted his shoulders.

Olivia was surprised. "You didn't bring an umbrella?"

Alexander gave a faint "Mm."

Sophia suddenly remembered.

The last time it rained.

Alexander had given his umbrella to her.

That umbrella was still in her entryway shoe cabinet.

She buried her head in her soup.

Pretending she knew nothing.

Alexander glanced at her.

The corner of his mouth lifted slightly.

…

Steam rose from the hot pot.

Rain pattered against the window outside.

Sophia felt warm all over from the meal.

Olivia left first after dinner.

Alexander drove Sophia home.

His car was parked at the mall opposite.

They walked back to the residential complex.

They passed through a grove of poplar trees.

The wind suddenly picked up.

Poplar catkins filled the air, swirling everywhere.

Sophia sneezed several times in a row.

Alexander handed her a tissue.

"Cover your nose."

Sophia did so.

Her breathing became much easier.

They quickened their pace home.

They parted ways in the hallway.

As soon as Sophia entered her apartment.

She started sneezing again.

Her nose was bright red.

She drank some hot water.

It provided slight relief.

Then she prepared her lunch for the next day.

By the time she finished, it was already eleven.

She took the trash downstairs.

Her phone rang when she returned.

It was Charlie Lowell.

"Sophia! Ethan is heading your way! He's drunk, I couldn't stop him—"

Sophia didn't get a chance to speak.

A dark figure suddenly rushed out.

"Ah!"

The strong smell of alcohol hit her.

Ethan Roscente's eyes were bloodshot.

He grabbed her wrist.

Snatched her phone and ended the call.

"First Sebastian Evans... now Charlie..."

His voice was hoarse.

"Sophia, you reject me but cozy up to my friends?"

Sophia turned her face away.

"You're drunk."

"Drunk?" Ethan laughed coldly. "In the past, you always took care of me when I was drunk... and now?"

He grabbed her shoulders.

"Why did you change?"

Sophia pushed him away forcefully.

"My concern is only for those who deserve it."

Ethan was stunned.

"I don't deserve it anymore?"

"You stopped deserving it a long time ago."

Sophia turned and ran.

Ethan lunged after her.

He grabbed her hair.

Sophia cried out in pain.
###Chapter 115

Ethan jerked his hand back.

Panic flickered in his eyes.

"Sophia, I'm sorry... I didn't mean to..."

Sophia Sullivan clutched her stinging scalp.

Tears welled up.

"Don't touch me!"

Charlie finally arrived.

Sebastian Evans was with him.

The man strode past Ethan.

"Are you okay?" His voice was urgent.

Sebastian had been negotiating an important contract.

He came immediately after hearing the news.

He saw Sophia's reddened scalp.

His brow furrowed deeply.

"You don't always have to be strong."

Sophia took half a step back.

Creating distance between them.

"I'm fine now."

Ethan suddenly exploded.

"Who asked you to come?!"

Sebastian gave him a cool glance.

"I go where I want."

Ethan sneered at Charlie.

"You called him here to mock me?"

Charlie shook his head helplessly.

Sebastian stepped between them.

"Take it out on me. Leave others alone."

"Brothers?" Ethan scoffed. "You think you deserve that?"

Sebastian's gaze turned icy.

"You're the one who ended it. Have you forgotten?"

Ethan fell silent.

Sebastian turned to Sophia.

"Go upstairs."

His voice was gentle.

"Trust me."

Charlie nodded in agreement.

Sophia turned and went upstairs.

She couldn't stay any longer.

Ethan tried to follow but was blocked.

"She doesn't want to see you," Sebastian said.

"She hates you!"

Sebastian gave a light laugh.

"Stop lying to yourself."

Ethan grabbed his collar.

"What did you tell her?!"

Sebastian shoved him off.

"Look at what you've become."

Charlie hurried to intervene.

"Both of you, stop!"

Ethan pointed at Sebastian.

"Stay away from her!"

Sebastian met his glare.

"Or what?"

Ethan's eyes turned dangerous.

"Don't make me forget our past."

Sebastian spoke each word clearly.

"You will lose her forever."

"Stop clinging to her."

He turned and walked away.

Charlie steadied the unsteady Ethan.

"Let's go back."

Ethan's eyes were empty.

"Why won't she forgive me..."

Charlie was silent for a moment.

"Because she fell out of love."

Ethan repeated numbly.

"Fell out of love?"

Charlie sighed softly.

"Not every mistake can be forgiven."

Ethan suddenly pushed him away.

He turned and rushed back downstairs.

Charlie quickly chased after him.

"Ethan! Where are you going?"
###Chapter 116

Ethan Roscente ignored him completely.

He walked straight towards the staircase.

Charlie Lowell quickly caught up and grabbed his shoulder. "Ethan, stop this. Let's go back. Sophia Sullivan won't open the door..."

"I have something to give her."

Charlie was stunned. "What is it?"

Ethan pulled a tube of anti-allergy ointment from his pocket. "This season always triggers her allergies. I need to get this to her..."

Charlie's nose suddenly stung with emotion.

How did two people who loved each other so deeply end up like this?

"Right," Ethan nodded, his voice distant. "I came to deliver the medicine... she needs this... she has to have it..."

His voice faded.

His vision went dark.

His body went limp and collapsed.

Charlie quickly caught him, dragging him toward the car.

He glanced at the SUV at the end of the alley and let out a heavy, weary sigh.

They returned to the Beverly Hills mansion at one in the morning.

A housekeeper opened the door. Charlie urgently said, "Quick, give me a hand! He's drunk. Prepare some hangover soup..."

After giving instructions, he drove away.

Isabella Langley was already asleep but was woken by the noise downstairs.

For Ethan, for her place in this wealthy family, she forced herself awake, threw on a robe, and went down.

"Go get some water. I'll help him," Isabella said, reaching out to take Ethan.

"Madam, it's not advisable for you right now..." The housekeeper looked worriedly at her stomach.

The full weight of a grown man was no joke.

Isabella waved a dismissive hand. "I know what I'm doing. Just do as I say."

"Well... alright." The housekeeper carefully transferred Ethan's weight to her.

Isabella staggered the moment she took his weight.

The drunk man's full weight pressed down on her shoulders.

"W-wait—" she called out hastily to the housekeeper heading for water. "Y-you better support him. I'll get the water..."

After a glass of warm water, Ethan became slightly more lucid.

Isabella crouched down, her face bright with hope. "Baby, are you—"

The man lifted his cold eyes.

Isabella's expression instantly changed. She quickly corrected herself, "Ethan, are you feeling better?"

Ethan sat up straight. "Move."

Isabella froze.

"Did you not understand me?"

"Ethan, please don't be like this. You're scaring me..." The girl's eyes welled up with tears, looking pitiful and fragile.

Ethan's face remained expressionless, unmoved. "Don't make me repeat myself."

Isabella bit back her tears and stood up, moving aside.

The man walked straight past her and headed up to the second floor.

Humiliated and angry, Isabella bit her lip. Meeting the housekeeper's curious gaze, she took a deep breath, forced composure, and even managed a weak smile.

"Ethan's still drunk and not himself. Go prepare the hangover soup. I'll bring it to the master bedroom later."

"Yes, Madam."

Inside the master bedroom, Ethan closed the door, his legs too weak to support him.

The image of Sophia Sullivan, her hair pulled, tears in her eyes from the pain, flashed in his mind. His heart wrenched violently.

He reached into his pants pocket. The ointment was gone!

He searched his entire body. Nothing.

He rushed downstairs and scoured the living room. Still nothing.

At that moment, it felt like he had lost the most important thing in his life.

He crouched behind the sofa and cried like a child.

Sophia...

I miss you so much...

Please come back.

The only response was the dark, empty living room and the howling cold wind outside the window.

...

Sophia Sullivan woke early the next morning.

She washed up, made breakfast, got everything in order, and prepared to leave for the lab.

As she closed her door, she noticed a paper bag hanging from the handle.

Inside was a tube of anti-allergy nasal ointment.

It was even the brand she usually used.

She looked around. Who left this?

Her gaze fell on the door across from hers. Sophia examined the bag carefully.

Just as she was about to knock and ask if Alexander Laurent had left it, the door suddenly opened from inside.

Alexander stepped out, his expression stern. He paused when he saw her.

Sophia noticed his unusual demeanor. "Is something wrong?"

Alexander was serious. "Let's head to the lab. I'll explain on the way."

"Okay." Sophia immediately grew solemn, forgetting about the ointment.

On the way, Alexander received a call.

Whatever was said made his face change dramatically, his tone turning cold and heavy.

"...Understood. We're on our way. We'll be there soon."

He hung up. Before Sophia could ask, he spoke first. "The lab computers crashed unexpectedly. All of this week's experimental data has been wiped. The worst-case scenario is—"

He paused. "The data is completely lost. We'd have to start over from scratch."

Sophia frowned. "Doesn't the lab data have backups?"

"The screens suddenly went black. After rebooting, we found most of the backups were also erased. Less than thirty percent remains."

To prevent data leaks and ensure computer efficiency, the lab performed data clean-ups monthly.

Last Monday was the end of the month, and a clean-up had just been done.

The computers shouldn't have had issues, and all data was backed up twice. But... the accident still happened.

Was it really just an accident?

Alexander thought it was too soon to tell.

...

At eight sharp, all lab members were present. Alexander and Sophia arrived just in time.

So did the computer technicians responsible for repairs.

They had signed confidentiality agreements and worked exclusively for the MIT labs.

When the computer issue arose, Quincy Evans had immediately contacted them for help.

They had sent someone right away.

But half an hour had passed with no progress.

Alexander asked, "What's the situation?"

Quincy replied, "I just got a call from Lillian. She was about to input data when the screen suddenly went black. After restarting, the data was gone, and most backups were lost too."

"The technicians have checked. Aside from the data loss, there are no other issues. They're currently trying to recover the backup data."

Zoe Langley frowned.

Lillian Lopez had always been in charge of the main data set. All group experiment reports passed through her hands, and she had never made a mistake before.

This sudden problem could mean everyone's hard work for the past two weeks was wasted.

She must be feeling terrible about it.

Sure enough, Zoe looked up and saw Lillian pacing anxiously, her face filled with worry and unease.

Simon Lowell didn't understand computers. After watching for a while, he couldn't help but ask, "Sir, can our data be recovered?"
###Chapter 117

The technician sighed.

"This is the fifth time you've asked in such a short period."

"Data recovery takes time. I need to identify the root cause first."

Simon Lowell immediately fell silent.

"Take your time. I won't disturb you."

He stole a glance at Professor Alexander Laurent.

His stomach was in knots.

He was terrified the professor would blame Lillian Lopez.

Simon moved closer to Alexander.

He lowered his voice.

"Professor, I was right there when the system shut down."

"Sophia definitely didn't do it on purpose."

"She hadn't slept for two days working on the data entry…"

Alexander rubbed his temples.

"I won't jump to conclusions before the investigation is complete."

He didn't favor anyone.

He only trusted evidence.

Simon wanted to argue further.

Zoe Langley subtly tugged his sleeve.

She signaled for him to stop.

Professor Laurent was always fair.

He would never wrong an innocent person.

Simon pressed his lips together.

He said nothing more.

Ten minutes later.

The technician stood up.

"It was a virus."

"The data… is essentially unrecoverable."

A heavy silence fell over the group.

They had suspected it.

But hearing it confirmed was still hard to accept.

Alexander's brow furrowed deeply.

"The lab is completely signal-shielded. The USB drives are specially encrypted."

"Where could the virus have come from?"

The technician shook his head.

"There are many potential carriers."

"The monitoring system, the access control recognition… any could be a medium."

Lillian bit her lip.

"How long will it take to trace the virus source?"

"That's hard to say. It depends on the specifics."

Zoe asked urgently.

"Is there really no way to save the data?"

The technician was helpless.

"The motherboard is damaged. The data can't be extracted."

Zoe refused to give up.

"No hope at all?"

Thinking of all their hard work going to waste.

Her chest felt tight.

Lillian began to sob quietly.

"It's all my fault… I shouldn't have only kept one backup…"

Zoe fell silent.

Quincy Evans sighed.

Simon also frowned deeply.

Alexander suddenly remembered something.

"It was connected to my work computer on Friday."

The technician's eyes lit up.

"Is there a data transfer record?"

Alexander nodded.

"Yes."

"Excellent! We can attempt a path recovery!"

Half an hour later.

Two-thirds of the data was successfully restored.

The group breathed a small sigh of relief.

Zoe hesitated.

"What about the remaining third?"

Sophia Sullivan spoke softly.

"If it's recent data, there might be a way."

Zoe pressed her.

"What way?"

Sophia explained.

"The lab uses a local area network."

"But the storage software is a Sun terminal."

"They added an AI recording function six months ago."

The computer technician suddenly understood.

"You mean the cloud AI backup?"

Everyone looked blank.

This was outside their area of expertise.

Alexander pondered.

"Sun's AI function isn't fully developed yet."

"It requires precise keyword searches."

"You'd need to remember at least one-tenth of the data."

Simon sucked in a breath.

"One-tenth… that's like three sets of experimental data!"

Quincy shook his head.

"That's too difficult."

"Who would memorize that stuff?"

Lillian scoffed.

"Pointless suggestion."

"No one could possibly remember that."

"Some people just love to show off…"

Sophia said calmly.

"Perhaps I can try."

Simon's eyes widened.

"You? You remember it?"

"You weren't even involved in the project!"

Lillian said disdainfully.

"Bragging without thinking!"

Zoe said worriedly.

"Sophia, the data is very complex…"

Alexander's gaze was gentle.

"Are you sure you want to try?"

Sophia nodded.

Alexander asked softly.

"How did you come across it?"

Sophia looked at Lillian.

Lillian immediately bristled.

"Why are you looking at me!"

Sophia hesitated for a moment.

"At noon, the day before yesterday."

"A report had fallen on the floor by Lab Station Three."

"It even had a footprint on it."

"I thought it was scrap paper…"

Lab Station Three was Lillian's assigned area.

All group reports were compiled and entered by her.
###Chapter 118
Losing a report was a major mistake.
Lillian's face paled.
Her voice shot up an octave.
"Sophia Sullivan, how dare you say that? All our group's reports were entered into the system! Not a single one is missing!"

She pointed at the computer screen.
"If you don't believe me, check the entry log. The computer might be infected, but this list is still here."

She spoke with deliberate slowness.
"Don't you dare try to pin this on me."

Sophia let out a soft, indifferent "Oh."
"They weren't lost because when I picked them up, I flipped through them. I noticed the date was from that day, so I put them back."

Lillian sneered.
"Then what gives you the right to say I lost them? You saw them on the floor, picked them up, and put them back. You're trying to have it both ways!"

"First," Sophia said, her tone even. "I only stated the fact that I found the reports. I didn't say who lost them. No one else jumped to that conclusion either. Your reaction is excessive."

"You implied it between the lines!"

"Second," Sophia's voice rose slightly. "If you think I'm lying, you can find that specific report and check if there's a footprint on the cover."

Lillian lifted her chin defiantly.
"Paper reports are destroyed after entry. Didn't you know that?"

"It's fine," Sophia replied calmly. "The lab has surveillance. Pull the footage from between 11 AM and 12 PM the day before yesterday. Everything will be clear."

Lillian's expression froze.
She did indeed see a report with a footprint on it on the desk that day.
She had just finished entering data and was relieved to have found that missing report in time, promptly entering it as well.

Professor Quincy Evans took one look at Lillian's face and knew Sophia was telling the truth.

He quickly stepped in to mediate.
"It's all a minor misunderstanding. There's no need to argue about who's right or wrong. The most urgent thing right now is to recover the lost data. Let's focus on solving the problem, alright?"

He cleared his throat gently.
"Sophia, you mentioned earlier that the AI search requires a large number of keywords? And about a tenth of them? This... this…"

Professor Evans trailed off, unable to continue.
Who could possibly remember that many?

Alexander Laurent, however, looked directly at Sophia.
"You looked at the contents when you picked up the report?"

"Yes," Sophia nodded.

"How much do you remember?"

"All of it."

A collective gasp went through the room.

Alexander's expression remained calm.
"The data from this report can serve as keywords for the AI search, correct?"

"Correct."

"Alright," Alexander opened his laptop. "Recite them. I'll take notes."

Sophia began.
"Thickness, unit um, spec value 25.0-26.0, test method…"

"MD tear resistance, unit g, spec value 62, test method…"

Professor Quincy Evans and Dr. Zoe Langley exchanged a look.
She can actually recite it?!

Professor Evans' expression shifted from doubt to shock, finally settling on sheer admiration.
Her memory is unbelievable!

Sophia spoke for nearly twenty minutes.
Alexander recorded one thousand, one hundred, and ninety-two individual data points.

He imported them all into the AI cloud system.
He hit enter, initiating the precise search.

In less than ten seconds, a massive amount of correlated data populated the screen.

Dr. Langley excitedly called over the IT technician.
"Sir! Come quick, look! Is this it…"

The technician sat down at the computer and worked for a moment.
"Data is definitely recovering, but I can't be sure if it's exactly what you need. Someone will have to verify it."

Lillian immediately walked to the computer.
The technician stood up and yielded his seat.

Time ticked by.
Dr. Langley asked anxiously, "How is it? How much has been recovered?"

"...Almost all of it," Lillian bit her lower lip, no trace of joy on her face.

Dr. Langley, unable to stand it, checked herself and finally breathed a sigh of relief.
"Thank heavens! We recovered ninety-nine percent!"

She linked her arm with Sophia's.
"We owe you big time this round! Otherwise, we'd be looking at two weeks of overtime! This data was a nightmare to compile."

"Truly an MIT student. Impressive brainpower," the IT technician gave a thumbs-up.

Professor Evans nodded repeatedly, his eyes full of approval.
"Absolutely, absolutely! Little Sophia saved the day this time!"

He suddenly sighed, a hint of teasing in his tone.
"No wonder they say Professor Laurent has a sharp eye. Snatching up such a promising seedling ahead of time. Truly impressive!"

His words were serious, but his gaze was meaningful.

Alexander's expression didn't change, as if he hadn't caught the subtext.
But the hand at his side unconsciously clenched.

A second later, startled by his own loss of composure, he took a deep breath and slowly relaxed his hand.
Yet some things, once stirred, were already in disarray…

Professor Evans clicked his tongue in amazement, staring at Sophia's head as if it were an alien artifact.

After a long moment, he blurted out,
"...Sophia, have you ever competed on 'Brain Games'?"

Sophia: "..."

Dr. Langley and Professor Evans: "Hahahaha—" Just laughter!

Only Lillian's gaze towards Sophia was icy and gloomy, like two bottomless black holes.

Dr. Langley observed Sophia's speechless expression, noticed Alexander's resigned look, saw Professor Evans scrutinizing Lillian, and caught the hostility in Lillian's eyes…
It seemed things wouldn't be boring from now on.

Tomorrow, she'd bring two bags of sunflower seeds from home.

...

The lab computer virus was an incident that could be interpreted lightly or seriously.
At best, it was an accident. At worst, it was espionage.

Alexander stated, "The source must be identified."

The IT technician replied, "Don't worry, the university will investigate too."

From the incident's start to the data recovery, the entire day was spent dealing with it.
By the time all the details were handled, it was already dark outside.

With the matter resolved, everyone headed home.

Alexander had to stay behind in the lab to tie up loose ends.
Sophia went back alone.

Fortunately, it was close, just a few minutes' walk.

She walked in the door and flopped onto the sofa.
She lay flat, stretched luxuriously, and let out a contented sigh.

"Ding-dong—"

Her WeChat chimed.

Sophia forced her eyes open, unlocked her phone, and checked.
It was a message from Alexander.

[Thank you for today. The virus source has been identified.]

Sophia rolled over and sat up abruptly, typing a reply:

[That fast?]
###Chapter 119

Sophia typed her reply.
"Okay. Someone infiltrated the monitoring room and implanted the virus into the internal network through the system."

"Who did it?" she asked.

Alexander replied.
"The person was masked. Their face wasn't visible."
"But it was definitely someone from inside MIT."

Sophia pressed her lips together tightly.

"We have to catch them. This time it's a virus."
"Next time, it could be something far more dangerous."

Alexander chuckled softly, holding his phone.

The IT technician beside him looked confused.
What was so funny about that?

This sudden laugh was... unsettling.

Alexander typed his response.
"Okay. I'll do whatever you say."

Sophia smiled.
She put her phone down and headed to the bathroom.

...

A pounding headache from last night's drinking made Ethan gasp.

He sat up and looked out the window.

It was already dark.

He had slept the entire day.

A dull ache pulsed in his stomach.
He reached for the bedside drawer with practiced ease.

He pulled out the bottle of stomach medicine.

He swallowed the pills with a glass of cold water.

The icy liquid slid down his throat.
It sent a shiver through his entire body.

"You shouldn't always rely on medicine. All medicine has some toxicity. Dietary therapy is best... Get up and drink this bowl of longan, red date, and yam soup..."

"Too sweet? Next time I'll use fewer red dates..."

"Can I drink less tonight? I've been nurturing your stomach for so long. One night of drinking ruins all my effort..."

"Ethan, please don't drink so much anymore. I worry about you..."

"If you come home this drunk again, I will be very angry!"

"It's radish and mutton soup today. You have to finish it... Mmm! You always use this trick when I make you drink soup. Silencing me won't work... Mmm!"

"Ethan, I'm angry. Kissing me won't help!"

...

"Stop drinking."

...

"Ethan Roscente, I don't like you when you're drunk."

...

"The congee is in the pot. I'm going to sleep first."

...

Memories of his time with Sophia flooded Ethan's mind.

She had always been against his drinking.

At first, she would get anxious and worried.
She would nag him like a little old lady.

But after the nagging, she would always bring him a steaming bowl of stomach-nourishing soup.

When he was in a good mood, he enjoyed the attention.

He would find ways to make her stop talking.

When he was in a bad mood, he found it irritating.

They would often have huge arguments.

Gradually, she stopped nagging him.

Every time he came home from a business dinner, she would be waiting on the couch.

Then she would hand him a bowl of hot soup or congee.

Ethan thought she had finally become sensible.

He even felt somewhat relieved.

What man doesn't have business dinners?

How can you have a business dinner without drinking?
Are you supposed to drink soda?

If you don't drink, but others do, you're not losing a drinking contest.
You're losing face.

Looking back now, Sophia wasn't being sensible.

She was just disappointed.
She couldn't be bothered to say anything anymore.

He looked at the pile of empty medicine boxes in the drawer.

Ethan couldn't remember the last time he had tasted her soup.

One day, two days...

Three months, half a year...

He missed her.
It made his heart ache.
It drove him insane!

The door opened quietly.

Isabella entered, carrying a tray.

Seeing he was awake, she smiled gently.
"Ethan, you've slept all day. You must be hungry."
"I made some oatmeal porridge and a few light side dishes..."

She walked to the bedside, about to set the tray down.

"Who said you could come in?" Ethan's voice was cold.

The woman froze.
"I... I was worried about you..."

"Get out."

"Ethan..."

"I said get out! Are you deaf?!"

Isabella bit her lip hard.
Her whole body trembled.

There wasn't a trace of tenderness on the man's face.

"From now on, you are not to enter this room without my permission."

"Why?" Isabella looked up, her eyes welling with tears.
"This is the master bedroom. It should be our room. Why can't I come in?"

"Heh, 'our' room?" The man's smile was cruel.
"Do you think you're worthy?"

Isabella swayed, barely able to stand.

Ethan made no move to steady her.

His gaze was mocking, as if watching a play.

"Get out!"

The woman turned away, utterly dejected.

"Wait..."

Hope flickered in Isabella's eyes.

The next moment, Ethan spoke.
"Take your garbage with you."

Isabella picked up the tray.
She left the master bedroom in disgrace.

The housekeeper approached.
"Young Madam, is the young master still not eating?"

Isabella quickly composed herself.
She sighed with concern.
"Yes, he has no appetite. My劝说 were useless."
"Please dispose of this. I'll go keep him company..."

"Of course. You go ahead. I'll handle this."

"Mm." Isabella nodded, satisfied.
She turned and went upstairs, one hand supporting her lower back.

The moment her back was turned, the smile vanished from her face.

She glanced toward the master bedroom.

She swore—

She would live in that room eventually!

That night, Ethan unusually stayed in.

He only asked Martha to bring a meal to his room at nine.

Isabella stayed in the guest room next door.

Hearing Martha come and go, she pressed her lips together.

In his eyes, was she really lower than a servant?

Her phone suddenly rang.

It was her roommate.

Isabella answered—

"Hello, Madison."

"Bella, are you okay?" Madison's voice was full of concern.

Isabella didn't hear concern.
She found it strange.

Who calls and asks if you're okay first?

Were they that close?

"I'm fine. Why?"

"You haven't been to class lately. You don't answer calls. We couldn't reach you at all."
"We thought something happened to you. We were so scared!"

Isabella stroked her still-flat stomach.
Her tone was leisurely.
"What could possibly happen to me?"

Even if something did happen, it would be good news.

Madison continued.
"When are you coming back to class? You've missed several roll calls for specialized courses."
"The teacher has already contacted the counselor. You don't answer your phone either..."

"This can't go on, Bella. Final grades depend on participation points. Too many absences will mean failing..."

Isabella interrupted impatiently.
"I know. But I have important matters lately. I can't attend class."
"Can you cover for me during roll call?"

"How can we do that? The teacher doesn't do verbal roll call anymore."
"They use an app for photo check-ins now. We can't help even if we wanted to."

Isabella frowned.
"Fine, whatever. I gave you such expensive perfume last time."
"You can't even do this small favor for me..."

She hung up directly.

The roommates looked at each other.

What had happened to her?

After hanging up, Isabella thought for a moment.
Then she dialed another number.

The call was answered quickly.
A cold voice spoke.
"What is it?"

"You..." She bit her lip.
"Can you get me that kind of medicine?"
###Chapter 120

Professor Alexander at her place?!

"What kind of medicine?"

"It's... the kind that excites men..."

Silence on the other end of the line, then a soft chuckle. "Have you really fallen so low that you need drugs to attract a man?"

Isabella Langley flushed with anger. "Just tell me if you can get it! The rest is none of your business!"

"Wait."

The line went dead after those two words.

Isabella lay on the bed, staring at the ornate ceiling.

Even the ceilings in rich people's homes were so meticulously designed.

Having experienced this kind of life, she could never go back.

She had to secure Ethan Roscente.

...

Early morning, Sophia Sullivan finished her housework, prepared lunch, and headed to the lab.

She completed two sets of data by mid-morning, pleased with her progress.

She saved the data, shut down her computer, and retrieved her lunchbox from the fridge to heat it.

Dr. Zoe Langley caught the delicious scent from across the room.

"Sophia, what did you bring? It smells amazing. Which takeout place is it from?"

Lemon chicken wings, golden brown and tempting. Garlic broccoli, vibrant green and fresh.

A perfect balance of protein and vegetables, visually appealing.

"I made it myself," Sophia said. "The chicken wings haven't been touched yet. Would you like to try one?"

Zoe swallowed hard.

"Don't mind if I do!"

She promptly helped herself to one.

The chicken wing was crispy outside, tender inside. "So good! You made this yourself?"

"Yes."

Zoe wasn't exaggerating. She rarely enjoyed food that suited her palate so perfectly.

Fresh ingredients, perfectly cooked.

Well-seasoned, richly fragrant.

Sophia smiled lightly. "It's just ordinary home cooking."

Zoe shook her head. "Not ordinary. This home cooking is exceptional!"

"What's exceptional?" Dr. Simon Lowell perked up at the mention of food.

"Sophia's cooking. Incredibly delicious! We have a master chef hiding in our lab!"

Sophia laughed. "Don't listen to Zoe's exaggeration. It's just average."

Simon stared at the plate of chicken wings, his eyes lighting up.

"I just ate, otherwise I'd definitely try one! Sophia, are you cooking again tomorrow?"

He had already eaten, feeling it inappropriate to share a girl's lunch.

But hearing Zoe's praise made him curious.

"I'll probably make something else tomorrow."

"I see..." Simon's face fell with disappointment.

Zoe's eyes also showed clear disappointment.

Sophia chuckled softly. "I've been in the lab for a while but haven't officially treated everyone to a meal. Since it's Friday today, how about after work? We can go out, or come to my place..."

"Your place!" Zoe immediately chimed in. "It's settled then. We'll come over at six."

"Okay," Sophia nodded. "I'll send the address to the group chat. I need to go grocery shopping first. You can come over after you finish work."

"Sure!"

Professor Quincy Evans asked, "Should we inform Alexander?"

Zoe said, "You inform him."

"Alright." Quincy took out his phone. "I'll ask if he's finished his class..."

At two in the afternoon, Sophia turned off her computer, tidied her lab station, and quietly left.

Just outside the door, she ran into Alexander Laurent.

"Going grocery shopping?" he asked.

Sophia was slightly surprised. "You know?"

"Yes, Quincy texted me. Let's go."

"?"

Alexander said, "Aren't you going to the supermarket? I'll drive you."

"Not busy today?"

Alexander replied, "Not particularly."

He could be busy, or not. It depended on the person.

"Okay, thank you."

She had been considering taking a taxi. Alexander's arrival was like a timely rain.

Money saved.

As it turned out, Sophia not only saved money but also effort.

All the grocery bags were carried by Alexander.

Sophia felt there were too many and wanted to share the load.

The man sidestepped her attempt. "No need. I've got it."

Back home, Sophia put on her apron and began preparing dinner.

"By the way, do any of them have dietary restrictions?" she suddenly remembered.

Alexander said, "Quincy doesn't eat shrimp. Everyone else is fine."

He rolled up his sleeves and entered the kitchen. "I'll help."

...

At six, the four lab members—Zoe, Quincy, Simon, and Lillian—left the lab for Sophia's place.

"Professor Evans, did you inform Professor Laurent?" Lillian Lopez asked suddenly.

She hadn't originally planned to come but changed her mind upon hearing Alexander would be there.

Simon thought his persuasion had worked.

Quincy said, "I did. His class ended a while ago. Not sure why he didn't return to the lab."

"But he said he'd come. He's probably going straight there."

Zoe exclaimed, "Huh? He's really coming?"

Quincy laughed. "What? You don't want him to come?"

Zoe pouted. "Don't put words in my mouth. When he's around, everyone feels pressured. We can't really let loose..."

"How loose do you want to be?" Quincy teased. "A wild horse needs reins. Alexander's presence will keep you in check."

"Pfft! You're the wild horse!"

Passing a flower shop, Zoe saw jasmine in full bloom and bought a bouquet as a gift.

Quincy and Simon each brought a basket of beautifully packaged fruit.

To Sophia's surprise, Lillian also brought a gift.

"Self-blended perfume. Top notes of orange, base notes are elegant. I think you'll like it."

"Thank you." Sophia was somewhat surprised but accepted it with a smile.

Zoe noticed Alexander wasn't there. "Should we call Professor Laurent? Why hasn't he arrived yet?"

Mainly, his lateness would delay dinner.

The aroma had already captivated her soul. Waiting another minute was torture.

Quincy took out his phone, about to dial, when he saw Alexander emerge from the kitchen wearing an apron, carrying a pot of soup to the table.

His movements were practiced, unlike someone doing it for the first time.

Quincy: ?

Everyone: !
###Chapter 121

Sophia's tongue felt tied.

She opened her mouth.

But no words came out.

The others were equally stunned.

Simon's gaze darted between Alexander and Sophia.

He looked like he'd uncovered a huge secret.

Lillian pressed her lips together.

Her eyes turned cold.

Professor Evans was the first to recover.

He spoke directly to Alexander.

"Alex, what's going on?"

Alexander's tone was flat.

"Helping out. Can't you see?"

Professor Evans raised an eyebrow.

"Helping all the way to her apartment?"

Alexander gave a quiet hum of affirmation.

"A good neighbor is better than a distant relative."

He glanced at Professor Evans.

"Better than showing up just to eat."

Professor Evans paused.

"Neighbor?"

Sophia quickly explained.

"Professor Laurent lives next door."

She looked at Alexander.

"I ran into him after leaving the lab this afternoon."

"He gave me a ride to the supermarket."

Zoe let out a sigh of relief.

She had almost thought there was something between them.

It scared her.

Simon also patted his chest.

Thank goodness it was a misunderstanding.

Lillian's expression cleared.

She gently reminded them.

"We should eat."

Zoe nodded vigorously.

Sophia ushered everyone.

"Please sit. Two more dishes are almost ready."

The meal was enjoyable.

Zoe praised Sophia's cooking endlessly.

Simon ate with his head down.

Lillian unusually finished most of her bowl.

Two dishes were particularly appetizing.

It was all Sophia's fault.

After dinner and cleanup.

Sophia saw her guests downstairs.

Alexander walked beside her.

They looked like a couple seeing off visitors.

Zoe's expression was odd.

Simon pestered Lillian.

"Lil, can I walk you?"

Lillian shook her head.

"I drove."

Simon nodded, disappointed.

"Drive safe."

Lillian didn't start her car immediately.

She found a number and dialed.

"Still in real estate?"

Laughter came through the phone.

"Yeah, it's all I know. What's up?"

Lillian bit her lip.

"I want to rent near MIT."

"A unit in a walk-up building."

"A few minutes' walk to the library."

The person paused.

"Are you sure?"

Lillian's voice was firm.

"Sure."

"Then only the old factory dormitories fit."

Lillian's eyes lit up.

"That's fine."

"But the area's rough. No proper management."

"It's okay. Please find one for me."

"Money is no object."

...

After the guests left.

Sophia and Alexander walked back.

Suddenly—

"Sophia."

Sophia turned.

Sebastian stood across the street.

Waving at her.

Alexander adjusted his glasses.

His expression calm.

Sebastian crossed the street.

"I was just coming to see you. Ran into you by chance."

"Something wrong?"

Sebastian nodded.

"Let's talk somewhere else."

"Is that okay?"

Sophia looked at Alexander.

Sebastian's gaze also settled on him.

"Professor Laurent. We meet again."

Alexander's tone was indifferent.

"Unfortunately."

"If you're looking for Sophia, you'll see me often."

Sebastian narrowed his eyes.

Alexander met his gaze.

Steady and composed.

Sophia checked the time.

"Is half an hour enough?"

"Plenty."

"Let's go to the bubble tea shop across the street."

They sat down.

Sophia got straight to the point.

"What is it?"

Sebastian looked serious.

"About the Maldives incident investigation."

"The legal team gathered some evidence."

"But it wasn't included in the report."

"I recently reviewed it and found something new."

"You might be interested."

Sophia was puzzled.

"What new finding?"

Sebastian handed her the investigation report.

"Look closely at the parts circled in red."

Sophia opened it.

Her expression grew more grave as she read.

Sebastian's voice was low.

"The oxygen tank leak."

"The venomous snake in the gift box."

"Neither could have been done by Isabella alone."

"Surveillance timestamps also prove it."

Sophia frowned.

"She had an accomplice?"

Sebastian nodded.

"Very likely."

"Legal judgment might be meaningless."

"But I chose to tell you."

"You have the right to know."

"Isabella is not simple."

"There might be someone behind her."

"Avoid contact with her if possible."

"Be cautious of your surroundings."

"Stay alert at all times."

"Call me if anything happens."

He shrugged.

"Day or night."

Sophia couldn't help but smile.

"Mr. Evans, you're a busy man."

Sebastian looked at her.

"I am busy."

"But you're always welcome to disturb me."

His gaze was intense.

"Only you."

Sophia's smile faded slightly.

"Thank you for telling me."

"I appreciate it."

Sebastian smiled.

"No trouble at all."

He said each word clearly.

"My pleasure."

Sophia lowered her eyes.

"It's getting late. I should go back."

Sebastian stood.

"I'll walk you."

They crossed the street.

Sebastian's gaze halted.

Alexander stood where they left him.

He hadn't moved.
###Chapter 122

Sebastian Evans immediately saw through Alexander Laurent's intentions.

As a man, he recognized those hidden thoughts.

They might be subtle, but they were definitely there.

And if they existed, he would notice.

Sebastian suddenly stopped and turned.

Sophia Sullivan was walking behind him, her view blocked. She almost bumped into him.

She quickly steadied herself.

"Sorry," Sebastian looked down at her. "I forgot something."

Sophia: "?"

The next second, a cup of hot milk tea was pressed into her hands.

The warm sensation spread through her palms, making her pause.

"Hold it steady. I'm not responsible if it spills."

Sophia was puzzled. "When did you buy this?"

They had been sitting face-to-face the whole time. She never saw him order.

Sebastian smirked. "That's a secret."

"Oh," Sophia nodded. "Seems like you've used this trick on plenty of girls."

"Wrong. Only you."

Sophia's smile faded.

She subtly took half a step back.

Sebastian noted her retreat. He knew not to push too hard right now.

If he scared this little rabbit into someone else's arms, it would be a total loss.

"Head back. I won't walk you up. I assume you don't want me to."

Sophia: "Goodbye."

"Mm."

Sebastian watched her cross the street before driving off.

Sophia stared at the milk tea, wondering what to do with it. She looked up and saw Alexander under a tree.

"Professor Laurent, you're still here?"

"Waiting for you." His gaze fell on the tea. "You like this?"

"Just occasionally."

Alexander stared at the cup. "I've never had it."

Sophia: "?"

"I don't know what it tastes like. Is it good?"

Sophia: "?? Would you... like to have it?"

Alexander: "Yes, thank you."

"You're welcome."

...

Sebastian felt pleased, his fingers lightly tapping the steering wheel.

He even felt patient waiting at the red light.

Charlie Lowell called. The car's Bluetooth automatically answered.

Deafening music blasted through the speakers. Sebastian frowned.

"Seb, what've you been up to?" Charlie moved to a quieter spot, but background noise persisted.

Sebastian: "Work."

"Besides work?" Charlie chuckled. "Any progress on the romance front?"

Sebastian raised an eyebrow. "Who's asking? Is Ethan Roscente there? Let him ask himself."

Charlie sighed helplessly, shrugging at Ethan who was smoking nearby.

"Come on, Seb! I was just making conversation!"

"Really?" Sebastian laughed softly. "Fine, I'll tell you. Is the speaker on?"

Charlie, who had just turned on the speaker: "..."

"It's on, right? Others can hear? Good. Here's the update."

Ethan paused his smoking, straightening up.

Sebastian: "Just left her place. She accepted the milk tea I gave her. Satisfied?"

"An hour ago, we were chatting at the tea shop."

"Every word is true. Feel free to verify~"

Charlie glanced at someone's dark expression: "..." Is it too late to turn off the speaker now?

Sebastian added fuel to the fire: "Hear that clearly? Need me to repeat it? Should someone record it for later study?"

Charlie: "..." Help!

"Seb, you must be busy. I'll hang up now."

The call ended abruptly.

Sebastian smiled lightly and stepped on the gas.

"Ethan..." Charlie spoke carefully. "He might be joking..."

Ethan turned expressionlessly and walked back to the private room.

Charlie hurried after him, inwardly complaining.

Julian Winston sat on the couch, signaling with his eyes: What's wrong with him? Did the cigarette ruin his mood?

Charlie: Don't ask. I'm exhausted.

Ethan called a waiter. "Open two bottles of whiskey. No one leaves until they're finished."

...

2 AM. The whiskey was gone. Everyone was drunk.

Ethan leaned against the bar, eyes closed, murmuring softly. "Sophia..."

Charlie moved closer to listen.

Julian held a cigarette. "Calling for Sophia again?"

"Yeah."

"Serves him right! The breakup was so ugly. He didn't leave her any dignity. Now he's acting like this."

"Pathetic."

"Ahem!" Charlie coughed tactically. "Enough. What now? Take him home?"

"We've all been drinking. Who can drive? Get a hotel room. He can go home after he sobers up."

"Okay." Charlie nodded.

...

Early morning. Hotel.

Ethan was woken by his ringing phone, his head throbbing.

"This better be important!" He answered without looking.

"Young Master, it's Martha. Miss Isabella has a stomachache. I don't know what to do. Can you come back?"

Ethan frowned. "If she's unwell, see a doctor. I'm not a physician."

Martha: "A doctor came. He said a pregnant woman's mood affects the baby. Having company might help. She doesn't seem to be faking. What if something happens to the child? Please come back."

Ethan didn't want to deal with it, but he remembered his promise to Victoria Roscente. He resigned himself to getting dressed.

He cursed under his breath and started getting ready.

...

At the Beverly Hills mansion, Isabella Langley knew Ethan was coming.

She applied a no-makeup makeup look and changed into a sexy off-the-shoulder gown.

Her belly was still flat, not showing the pregnancy. She had even gained a little weight from careful rest.

The silk fabric accentuated her curves, making her look alluring.

Isabella adjusted her hem in the mirror, satisfied.

Soon, Ethan arrived home.

She held her lower back and greeted him with a smile. "Ethan, you're back. I missed you so much."
###Chapter 123

Ethan's gaze swept over her.

A cold smirk tugged at his lips.

"Stomachache? You look perfectly fine to me."

Sophia felt uneasy under his scrutiny.

His eyes seemed to see right through her.

Her little act was completely transparent.

"When you're not home, I have no one to talk to..."

"It's so lonely."

Ethan cut her off sharply.

"If you're bored, go read a book."

"Aren't you a student? Don't you have classes? What about grad school?"

"If you're this free, go help Martha with her work."

Sophia was momentarily speechless.

Ethan's expression turned even colder.

He'd seen this cheap trick too many times.

He turned to leave.

A soft body suddenly pressed against his back from behind.

Arms wrapped tightly around his waist.

"Ethan, don't go."

"I've missed you so much."

"Even if you hate me, think of the baby..."

Ethan violently shook off her hands.

His eyes filled with disgust.

"Get away from me!"

"Don't use the child as an excuse."

"I told you to get an abortion, but you went behind my back and contacted my mother."

"We still have that score to settle!"

Sophia's eyes darted away.

"I'm sorry, I just..."

"Behave yourself, or I'll throw you out right now!"

He turned and went upstairs.

His retreating figure was resolute.

Sophia clenched her jaw.

She took a deep breath.

Telling herself she had to endure this.

Marrying Ethan was her only way out.

She had already sacrificed too much.

She couldn't lose now.

She couldn't afford to lose.

Three seconds later, she was calm again.

She remembered Ethan liked oatmeal porridge.

She had smelled alcohol on him earlier.

He must have drunk a lot last night.

This was her chance.

Master Bedroom—

Ethan drank the hangover remedy.

He still felt terrible.

He soon fell asleep again.

When he woke up, it was already 2 PM.

A sharp pain twisted in his stomach.

He went downstairs irritably.

"Martha, is there anything to eat?"

No one answered.

He called out again, more impatiently.

"Martha—"

"Ethan, you drank last night."

"I made some oatmeal porridge, have some..."

Sophia hurried out obsequiously with the bowl.

Before she could finish, he knocked the bowl from her hands.

"Ah—"

She cried out in shock.

The scalding porridge spilled onto the carpet.

A few drops splashed onto her hand.

"Who told you to take matters into your own hands?"

Ethan's gaze was icy.

Full of mockery.

Sophia lowered her head,sad.

Tears welled in her eyes.

"I'm sorry, I was just worried about you."

"Your stomach was hurting..."

She exposed her pale neck.

Looking pitiful and delicate.

Ethan remained completely unmoved.

"Stop with the pathetic act!"

"Your acting skill is terrible."

"If you want to play the victim, at least do it convincingly."

"I provide for you, not so you can play games with me!"

"That's not it, I love you—"

A fierce darkness swirled in Ethan's eyes.

The sound of her voice alone annoyed him.

He kicked the broken bowl aside.

It shattered with a loud crack.

Sophia trembled in fear.

"Stop fucking pretending in front of me!"

"Get back to your room in three seconds!"

He pointed upstairs.

His expression was terrifying.

Sophia didn't dare stay any longer.

She scurried upstairs, shaking.

...

After that meal.

Sophia Sullivan grew closer to everyone.

It was largely thanks to her cooking skills.

Now she made extra food every day.

So others could easily share.

Zoe Langley and the others returned the favor.

Often helping her with experimental questions.

The biggest change was in Quincy Evans.

Ever since Sophia Sullivan learned his mental math techniques.

The way he looked at her changed.

He often pulled her aside to discuss calculation problems.

Sophia learned quickly.

She could soon apply the concepts fluently.

Quincy became even more enthusiastic.

He practically treated her as his protégé.

The two discussed whenever they had free time.

Always surrounded by scratch paper and pens.

"Quincy, taking on a disciple?"

"Professor Evans, I want the same treatment!" Simon Lowell raised his hand jokingly.

Quincy waved him away.

"Go away, work on your report."

Everyone laughed.

Sophia Sullivan also smiled slightly.

She didn't even hear Alexander Laurent calling her.

"Sophia? Sophia Sullivan?"

"...Huh? Professor Laurent, you called me?"

"Yes, come here for a moment."

"Okay."

...

The next day, Quincy couldn't smile anymore.

Zoe saw his troubled expression.

"What's wrong, Quincy? Did the boss say something?"

Quincy smiled bitterly.

He patted the stack of materials beside him.

"Said I had too much free time, gave me a new project."

"Won't have time to discuss mental math with Sophia anymore."

Sophia Sullivan was smart and learned quickly.

No teacher would dislike that.

But the new project was more important.

He had to prioritize work.

Zoe patted his shoulder sympathetically.

"This project needs you specifically, good luck!"

Quincy let out a long sigh.

It couldn't be helped.

...

Another Saturday arrived in the blink of an eye.

Finally, time to rest.

Sophia Sullivan had just gotten home.

She hadn't sat for long when she got a call from Olivia Lopez.

"Clara, my cousin is getting married."

"Mom wants me to go gift shopping with her."

"But I'm swamped with this new project."

"You have great taste, could you go with my mom?"

"When?"

"Tomorrow."

"I'm free, but will your mom be okay with it?"

"She'd love it!"

"Says my taste is out of sync with hers."

"Loves your aesthetic sense."

"Wishes she could adopt you as her daughter."

"Sure." Sophia Sullivan agreed with a laugh.

...

Alexander Laurent had worked through the entire night.

The sky was already bright when he got home.

He had caught a cold from the changing seasons.

His head was throbbing badly.

He only came back to rest because he couldn't take it anymore.

He took out his keys to open the door.

Suddenly, the door across from his also opened.
###Chapter 124

Sophia Sullivan wore her bear-print pajamas, her eyes still heavy with sleep.

She rubbed her eyes and yawned.

Alexander Laurent stood at the door, his voice slightly hoarse.

"Did I wake you?"

The old building had poor soundproofing. Footsteps in the hallway were clearly audible.

Sophia shook her head. "I should get up anyway."

She had plans to go shopping with Eleanor Watson that afternoon and needed to get up early to review her thesis.

Seeing how tired she looked, Alexander softened his voice. "You can sleep a little longer."

She studied him. "Do you have a cold?"

He paused, surprised. "You can tell?"

"Your voice is very hoarse. Do you have a fever?"

He raised a hand to his own forehead. "I can't tell. Probably not."

Sophia raised an eyebrow. "Professor Laurent, that's not very scientific."

He sighed helplessly. "I don't have a thermometer at home."

"I do. Wait here."

She turned and went back into her room, retrieving a thermometer from a drawer.

She disinfected it with alcohol and wiped it dry with a cotton pad.

Alexander was already lying on the sofa.

He hadn't even taken off his slippers, a clear sign he wasn't feeling well.

"Professor Laurent?" she called softly.

No response.

She moved closer and called his name again.

His eyes snapped open.

Their gazes met.

Her face was inches from his, her eyelashes fluttering slightly.

His heart skipped a beat.

"You scared me," she said, handing him the thermometer. "Check your temperature."

39 degrees Celsius.

A high fever.

"You need to go to the hospital."

He shook his head. "Medicine will be enough."

"Do you have any?"

"...No."

Sophia sighed. "I have some. I'll get it."

She prepared cold medicine and fever reducers, watching as he took them.

When she returned from washing the glass, he was already asleep.

She gently covered him with a blanket and quietly left.

…

Isabella Langley felt powerless against Ethan Roscente's coldness.

Everything she did was wrong.

She was afraid to provoke him again, but couldn't bear the growing distance.

She decided to start with Victoria Roscente.

Ethan respected his mother. That much was clear from the fact Isabella was still allowed to stay in the mansion.

The next day, she found out Victoria's schedule from Martha.

She arrived at the mall early to stage a chance encounter.

Victoria hadn't been shopping in a long time. A sales associate had invited her to see the new collection.

Running into Isabella, they decided to browse together.

Isabella proactively swiped her card to pay for several bags.

It was Ethan's supplementary card, but it was still better than last time's scarf.

The two women entered a luxury boutique.

A sales associate greeted them warmly. "Madam, the new arrivals would suit you perfectly."

Victoria tried on two outfits.

Isabella appeared calm on the surface, but her heart was bleeding.

Tens of thousands of dollars, gone just like that.

She had never been so extravagant.

Even with the supplementary card, to maintain a good impression, she only dared to make small purchases.

Her own luxury bags had all been gifts from others.

The entire wall of Hermès bags in the master bedroom? Ethan didn't allow her to touch them.

Victoria saw right through her, feeling a private disdain.

Coming from an ordinary family, she was stingy and lacked grandeur.

She wanted things but didn't dare to admit it, pretending to be above it all.

Hypocritical.

For the sake of the child, Victoria bit her tongue.

She pointed to the display area. "Pick out a couple of things."

Isabella pretended to decline.

"Suit yourself," Victoria said coolly.

Isabella was stunned.

Suddenly, the sales associate hurried toward the entrance. "Mrs. Laurent! You're here! I was just about to send the new collection to you!"

Victoria turned and saw Eleanor Watson.

She wore a celadon-colored cheongsam with a pearl shrug and carried a bamboo handle bag.

Elegant and intellectual, she looked like a figure from an ancient painting.

Eleanor came from a family of scholars, her demeanor gentle and refined.

Over forty, she was well-preserved and could pass for early thirties.

The social circle was small. The Laurent and Roscente families had business dealings, so they often crossed paths.

But they were never close.

Eleanor was talented, beautiful, and came from a prominent family. She was the center of attention everywhere.

Victoria often felt like a mere accessory in comparison.

Eleanor did not care for Victoria.

A minor actress who leveraged a pregnancy to marry into the Roscente family. She was calculating and acerbic.

Most importantly, she had treated Sophia Sullivan poorly.

Eleanor knew about Sophia's past with Ethan.

She felt sorry that such a wonderful girl had been fixated on the wrong man, but was glad she had come to her senses in time.

"Mrs. Laurent, it's been a while," Victoria said with a smile.

"Hello," Eleanor replied curtly, not wishing to engage.

She waved toward someone behind her, her smile warm. "Sophia, over here."
Sophia Sullivan emerged from the restroom.

Nina White stood inside the store, waving her over.

Victoria Roscente followed the direction of the wave.

A familiar face came into view.

Sophia Sullivan.

Isabella Langley saw her too.

Sophia wore light makeup.

A camel trench coat paired with brown suede knee-high boots.

Her hair was casually pulled up with a claw clip.

She looked comfortable and relaxed.

She carried a unique, effortless grace.

She walked over to Nina White.

Naturally looping her arm through the older woman's.

"Auntie Bai."

"Have you been waiting long?"

She completely ignored Victoria Roscente and Isabella Langley.

Not even a glance.

Victoria was instantly furious.

She thought of how her son still pined for this woman.

Yet Sophia had ended things so cleanly.

Isabella thoughtfully poured tea and handed it over.

"Auntie, some water."

"You must be tired from shopping so long."

Victoria managed a smile.

"Xixi is so considerate."

"Pretty and thoughtful."

"Not like some people."

"Who lack even basic manners."

Nina White smiled faintly.

"Mrs. Roscente."

"And this is?"

Her gaze settled on Isabella Langley.

"Aren't you going to introduce us?"

Victoria's expression tightened.

Isabella was pregnant.

But she had no official status.

At best, she was a girlfriend.

At worst, a mistress.

How could she introduce that?

If word got out.

Her standing in the social circle would be ruined.

Isabella's eyes were full of hope.

Status mattered most to her.

Ethan Roscente refused to give it.

But Victoria had spent a fortune today.

Surely she would acknowledge her now.

Victoria gave a dry laugh.

"Just a friend's child."

"Keeping me company while shopping."

Isabella's smile froze.

Nina White let out a faint "Oh."

"I thought she might be your future daughter-in-law."

"Of course not."

Victoria hurriedly denied it.

"Ethan isn't seeing anyone."

Nina White said no more.

She turned to Sophia.

"Clara has excellent taste."

"Help me pick out a few outfits."

Sophia nodded in agreement.

It wasn't her first time shopping with Nina White.

She knew the woman's preferences well.

Sophia went to select clothes.

Nina White suddenly sighed.

"Our Clara is so sweet and understanding."

"Beautiful and highly educated."

"I wonder which man will be lucky enough to marry her."

She cast a faint glance at Isabella.

Everyone in their circle knew about the Roscente family's situation.

Victoria wanted to hide the shame.

Nina White wouldn't let her.

"A girl should still have self-respect."

"Getting pregnant before marriage."

"No amount of beauty can cover up a flaw in character."

Victoria's smile was strained.

She couldn't retort.

Isabella paled.

An out-of-wedlock pregnancy was a stain.

Her education was an even bigger weakness.

Sophia did her undergrad at MIT.

Now she was in grad school.

Isabella's Caltech degree couldn't compare.

But she couldn't swallow her anger.

A sales associate brought over some clothes.

Isabella stepped forward to take them.

"Auntie."

"Let me help you pick something too."

Victoria glanced at Nina White.

Hmph.

So you have help.

I have mine too.

She smiled and nodded.

"Alright."

"I trust your taste."

Completely forgetting her previous complaints about Isabella's poor aesthetic.

Isabella immediately went to choose clothes.

Ordering the associate to fetch this and that.

Full of commanding presence.

Sophia was completely different.

She first examined the colors and styles.

Then felt the fabric.

Only then did she ask the associate to take it down.

She coordinated complete outfits.

"Auntie Bai."

"Please try these two sets."

Nina White took the clothes.

Her eyes full of anticipation.

She adored Sophia's taste.

Every outfit hit the mark perfectly.

It was even more enjoyable than shopping with her own daughter.

This was true compatibility.

Isabella finished her selections.

Victoria went into the fitting room.

She came out first.

A red A-line skirt with a Chanel-style tweed jacket.

It made her look considerably younger.

Victoria looked in the mirror.

Somewhat satisfied.

"Not bad at all."

Isabella smiled modestly.

"Auntie takes good care of herself."

"Your figure is slimmer than mine."

Victoria was pleased.

But the next moment.

Nina White walked out of her fitting room.

Victoria's smile stiffened.

Sophia had chosen a light cyan new Chinese-style cheongsam.

With a subtle bamboo pattern.

The silk had a luxurious texture.

The modernized cut flattered her figure.

It made Nina White appear tall, elegant, and graceful.

Her demeanor was gentle and refined.

Standing beside her.

Victoria looked like a meticulously dressed little old lady.

Trying too hard to appear young.

The difference was stark.

For the next look.

Nina White utterly outshone Victoria.

Isabella had been full of confidence.

Victoria was short.

Many clothes didn't suit her.

It was hard to find good options.

She had painstakingly chosen two outfits.

But.

Isabella's choices fit well.

They catered to Victoria's tastes.

The designer cuts weren't bad.

They could have passed.

But Sophia's two selections were too outstanding.

Nina White's superior conditioning.

Without comparison, there was no damage.

Victoria looked like a maid.

Drenched in luxury but exuding vulgarity.

Facing each other.

The contrast was even more intense.

Nina White looked in the mirror.

Surprised and delighted.

"Clara."

"This is my first time trying this style."

"But I love it."

"How did you think of it?"

A silk camisole with black silk wide-leg trousers.

The person was the same.

But the aura was instantly different.

Large silver hoop earrings were eye-catching.

Bold yet casually lazy.

The previous set was gentle and serene.

This one was sophisticated and capable.
Sophia Sullivan smiled faintly. "The cheongsam style is still too restrictive. Perhaps we could try something more relaxed."

Victoria Roscente's face darkened, but she suppressed her anger due to the setting.

Isabella Langley bit her lower lip. She hadn't expected to be completely outshone by Sophia.

Nina White took in their reactions with a slight scoff. "Some people can't tell pearls from glass. It's laughable."

"Wrap both of these up," she indicated to the sales associate.

"Right away, madam." The associate beamed and went to process the payment.

"Clara, let's go look elsewhere."

"Alright."

After they left, Victoria stared at the clothes she was wearing, wishing she could tear them to shreds on the spot.

Remembering how she had been utterly humiliated by Nina White moments before, she suddenly pointed at Isabella. "What an embarrassment! If you can't even handle something as simple as coordinating an outfit, what use are you?"

Isabella cradled her pregnant belly, speaking in a low voice. "I've been so tired since getting pregnant. Ethan had business entertainment until the early hours last night. I was up all night taking care of him. 
###Chapter 125

My mind is a bit fuzzy... I'm sorry to disappoint you..."

Victoria's gaze swept over Isabella's abdomen, forcing her anger down.

But she still found everything about Isabella irritating.

"I'll let it go this time, for the child's sake. Your taste truly needs improvement. How else will you fit into high society? It's embarrassing to be seen with you!"

Isabella's eyes suddenly lit up—did this mean she was being accepted into the Roscente family?

She immediately responded obediently, "Auntie, I will study hard."

Victoria pulled an invitation from her handbag. "Words are useless. Come with me to the ladies' tea tasting tomorrow. You need more exposure to develop better taste."

These so-called tea tastings were essentially social gatherings for wealthy matrons.

With tea culture flourishing recently, these elegant assemblies had gradually replaced traditional dessert parties.

Attendees didn't necessarily love tea, but they had to be able to discuss it knowledgeably.

Victoria didn't expect a miraculous transformation from Isabella, only that she wouldn't cause another public scene.

"This is a top-tier social event. Prepare properly. Don't embarrass me again!"

Isabella clutched the invitation tightly, assuring her repeatedly. "I will definitely do my homework beforehand."

"You'd better."

...

Outside the mall, Nina White smiled and patted Sophia's hand. "Thank you for accompanying me today."

"Shopping with you was a pleasure, Aunt Bai."

Sophia had also found clothes she liked.

"By the way, I have a favor to ask." Nina White clasped her hands together in a pleading gesture, looking charming.

"What is it?"

"I'm hosting a tea tasting tomorrow. The tea master I hired suddenly fell ill and was hospitalized..." Nina White sighed helplessly. "I heard you are knowledgeable about tea. Could you possibly fill in? Just talk about tea culture and demonstrate the brewing process."

Though she hadn't seen Sophia's skills firsthand, Olivia Lopez had highly recommended her. She should be competent.

Nina White didn't need master-level expertise, just enough to maintain appearances.

Sophia considered for a moment. Seeing the eager expectation in the other woman's eyes, she finally nodded. 
###Chapter 126

"Send me the address."

"Wonderful! Thank you, Clara!"

That evening, when Sophia asked for time off, Professor Laurent asked for the reason. She explained truthfully.

Upon learning the event was at the Bulgari Hotel five kilometers away, ending at 5 p.m., he said, "I have a meeting nearby tomorrow. I can give you a ride back."

"Thank you, Professor."

...

The next day at the tea tasting.

The elite ladies of Shanghai had gathered, mostly out of respect for Nina White.

The influence of the second lady of the Laurent family was never to be underestimated.

Before the tea ceremony began, the socialites had already formed small groups, exchanging gossip about high society and the latest handbag releases.

As the hostess, Nina White was incredibly busy.

A sudden commotion came from the entrance.

"Madam Laurent, you're here too?"

Nina White turned towards the voice and immediately smiled, stepping forward to greet her. "Eldest sister-in-law, please, come in..."

Sylvia Laurent—wife of the eldest branch of the Laurent family, the true lady of the house.

As the wife of Kevin White, Nina White's relationship with this sister-in-law had always been delicate.

Sylvia Laurent scanned the venue, frowning slightly. "Why choose a place like this?"

Nina White smiled in explanation. "There are hot springs on the back mountain. I thought everyone could relax there after tea."

Sylvia Laurent gave a light humph. "You certainly know how to follow trends."
###Chapter 127
Nina White was accustomed to such gatherings.

She stepped forward with a practiced smile.

"Idle hands at home. A tea party seemed a pleasant diversion."

"Your presence honors me, Sister-in-law."

Sylvia Laurent gave a curt nod.

She detested these social affairs.

Yet she came today nonetheless.

Soon, Victoria Roscente arrived with Isabella Langley.

The unfamiliar face drew immediate attention.

"Victoria, who is this?"

Victoria was prepared.

"My friend's daughter, Isabella Langley. She attends Caltech."

Isabella offered a demure greeting.

"How youthful."

"Caltech is quite prestigious."

The ladies offered hollow compliments, their eyes exchanging silent mockery.

That dress was three seasons old.

Hopelessly outdated.

Everyone knew the Roscente family's circumstances.

Victoria's "friend's daughter" story was pathetic.

She was only fooling herself.

They all understood. They were here for the spectacle.

Victoria remained oblivious.

She took a seat beside Sylvia.

"You look exquisite today, Mrs. Laurent."

Sylvia glanced at her.

"It's silk tapestry."

Victoria's smile faltered.

"Kesi suits your elegance perfectly."

She changed the subject.

"Nina White must own a similar dress, no?"

Sylvia finally looked at her properly.

"And you are?"

"The Roscentes."

"Ah. Mrs. Roscente." Sylvia's laugh was cold. "Attempting to stir trouble? Our Laurent family matters are no concern of outsiders."

She rose and moved to another seat.

Victoria's face darkened.

Nina White watched from a distance, her expression disdainful.

Her sister-in-law might be difficult, but she was family.

Victoria was simply unwell.

Sylvia's new seat faced Isabella directly.

The girl's timid demeanor irritated her.

That delicate, shrinking violet act.

It was nauseating.

She averted her gaze.

Nina White approached at the perfect moment.

"Sister-in-law, the light is poor here. Perhaps the other side would be better."

The new location was finally peaceful.

Sylvia gave Nina White a look of approval.

Nina White responded with a resigned smile.

Once everyone was seated, the tea ceremony began.

A figure entered through a side door.

A jade orchid cheongsam, embroidered with silver thread.

Her hair was swept up with a simple簪 (zān) pin, her makeup understated.

Sophia Sullivan ascended the platform gracefully.

All eyes followed her unconsciously.

She settled elegantly and began to speak, her voice soft and measured.

"A leaf falls into water, altering its essence. Thus, tea is born."

"China is the homeland of tea. Its history traces back to the era of Shennong."

"Tea is one of life's seven daily necessities."

"Lu Yu's 'The Classic of Tea' from the Tang Dynasty heralded the flourishing of tea culture."

Sophia narrated, her pace steady and unhurried.
###Chapter 128

The audience was utterly captivated.

"Amelia, this teacher is wonderful. Where did you find her? The previous ones were always elderly gentlemen."

The Tea Tasting Soirée had been held many times, each arranged by a different lady.

It was Amelia Roscente's turn this time. The usual master had suddenly fallen ill, so she had asked Sophia Sullivan to fill in.

Such "unexpected incidents" had never occurred before.

Another lady nodded in agreement. "Exactly! Why not invite such a beautiful female teacher? Always finding elderly gentlemen. This is so much better."

"Easy on the eyes, and educational too."

"This girl is truly remarkable. She speaks so gently and softly."

Isabella Langley and Victoria Roscente were both stunned when they saw Sophia appear.

They watched her ascend the platform with composure.

She discussed tea culture eloquently, quoting classics with effortless ease.

Isabella heard nothing but praise all around her.

Everyone was saying how good Sophia was, how beautiful, how exceptional her poise was.

How?

She knew nothing about tea. What right did she have to sit up there putting on airs, lecturing these society ladies?

Who did she think she was?

Resentment flashed in Isabella's eyes, a deep, churning jealousy.

"Wait a moment." She suddenly stood up, interrupting Sophia.

All eyes instantly focused on her.

Victoria tried to pull her back, but it was too late.

Amelia frowned slightly.

Sophia looked up calmly. "Do you have a question?"

Isabella smiled. "Teacher, you're lecturing on tea culture. Are you a certified Tea Master? Aren't you a bit too young? And the content you're presenting sounds very unprofessional. It even seems like you're directly quoting lines from CCTV documentaries."

Whispers broke out among the crowd.

"Yes, why was the teacher suddenly changed?"

Those who had attended before knew the lecturer was always an elderly gentleman. A young girl was a sudden change...

Amelia stood up to explain. "Master Quincy fell ill the day before yesterday. I specially invited a new teacher. I assure you, her tea art is absolutely professional."

Isabella raised an eyebrow. "Then may I ask what level of Tea Master this teacher is?"

She had done her homework last night.

Tea Masters were divided into five levels: Primary, Intermediate, Advanced, Technician, and Senior Technician.

Each level required a nationally issued vocational qualification certificate.

It involved rigorous examinations.

Her roommate had taken the Primary Tea Master exam. She signed up for a prep course and failed twice before passing.

So what if Sophia knew a little? She absolutely could not have a certificate!

Amelia looked troubled.

She was annoyed by Isabella's disruption, but even more concerned that Sophia might not have a certificate.

She looked at Sophia, her gaze worried.

Sophia gave her a reassuring look, then turned to Isabella. "You said I'm unprofessional. Please specify exactly where I was unprofessional."

Isabella was taken aback.

She had just said it casually. How would she know the specifics?

The knowledge she crammed last night hadn't stuck at all.

Her eyes darted around. She forcefully changed the subject. "Right now, I'm asking you if you have a certificate. Don't try to evade the question."

"As a teacher, listening to student opinions and answering questions is my duty. You said I'm not good. Fine. But you must provide a reason. I don't accept baseless accusations!"

Sophia's forceful demeanor left Isabella flustered.

The suspicious looks from the crowd made her press her lips together and straighten her back. "The common knowledge you just mentioned, who doesn't know that?"

"Even if they didn't, a quick online search would let anyone say a few lines."

"Different Tea Master levels mean different depths of lectures. Did we come here today just to listen to basic knowledge?"

Some ladies were swayed and actually nodded in agreement.

"She has a point. Without a certificate, who knows if you're an imposter? What if it's a scam?"

"Exactly. There are many frauds these days. Just show the certificate to put everyone at ease. It shouldn't be hard if you have one, right?"

Amelia's expression had already darkened.

Sophia was her guest. Questioning Sophia was questioning her.

In contrast to Amelia's tension, Sylvia Laurent leisurely sipped her tea, enjoying the show.

This trip was worth it today. There was drama to watch.

She hadn't met Sophia before and didn't know this girl, but her looks and temperament weren't the type Sylvia liked.

How to put it? That deliberate affectation of being "refined and detached," "unassuming," but actually just pretentious.

All that elegance, composure, and exceptional poise—in her eyes, it was all an act!

Like Amelia.

Like Sophia.

They both perfectly stepped on her pet peeves.

Sylvia even thought with schadenfreude that if this young girl couldn't produce a certificate, she might be in for a rough time today.

Sophia took in everyone's reactions. Not only was she not flustered, she even reassured Amelia with a look.

"If I produce my Tea Master qualification certificate, how do you plan to apologize for your baseless accusations and rude behavior?"

Isabella sneered. "If you can really produce it, I'll apologize any way you want."

"Good." Sophia was waiting for this very sentence.

She beckoned to the tea server at the door.

The young girl, wearing the soirée's custom Hanfu—a high-waisted ruqun—hurried over with small, quick steps.

Sophia had entrusted her bag and belongings to her care upon arrival.

The clever girl proactively handed over the bag.

Sophia smiled. "Thank you."

The girl blushed, softly saying it was no trouble.

Before coming, anticipating it might be useful, Sophia had placed her certificate in her bag.

Certificates of different levels had distinct colors.

In front of everyone, she slowly began to unzip her bag...
###Chapter 129

She produced a red certificate.

Gilded letters spelled out the words "Qualification Certificate" in both English and Chinese.

It was an Advanced Tea Master certification.

"Is this sufficient now?" Sophia Sullivan lifted her gaze. "Shall I bring it closer for your inspection?"

Isabella Langley's eyes widened.

She actually had certification!

Isabella bit her lip. "Certificates can be forged."

Sophia gave a light laugh. "State-issued certificates have serial numbers. You may verify it on the official website."

Someone immediately pulled out their phone to check.

"It's verified! The information matches perfectly. It's genuine!"

Isabella paled. "A certificate doesn't prove skill. Many are unqualified yet still certified."

Sophia's expression remained calm. "Then watch closely."

She switched on the electric kettle.

She poured mountain spring water into it.

"The first step in brewing tea is heating the water. Mountain spring water is ideal for its clarity and sweetness."

Once the water boiled, she poured it into the teapot.

"Step two: warming the pot. Boiling water rinses the pot and raises its temperature, which helps release the tea's aroma."

After warming the pot, she took out the tea leaves.

"Step three: adding the leaves. Too many leaves make it bitter; too few make it weak. The amount must be just right."

The leaves settled into the pot.

She lifted the kettle.

"Step four: pouring the water. Pour slowly along the side of the pot to avoid directly hitting the leaves."

Hot water met the tea leaves.

The aroma began to diffuse.

She covered the pot.

"Step five: steeping. The time depends on the type of tea, ranging from tens of seconds to a minute."

She waited quietly.

After forty seconds, she removed the lid.

The tea's fragrance filled the air.

"Step six: serving the tea." She poured the tea into a fairness pitcher, then into tasting cups. "This ensures even consistency, preventing the first cup from being too strong and the last too weak."

She raised a cup.

She gently inhaled the scent.

"Finally, tasting. Appreciate the tea's color, aroma, flavor, and form. Experience the art of tea."

She took a small sip.

The entire process was fluid and effortless.

Her explanation was clear and thorough.

Isabella's palms were sweating.

She wanted to flee but found herself rooted to the spot.

Sophia set down her cup.

"Bai Juyi wrote: 'For no reason, I hold a bowl of tea; I send it to one who loves tea.'"

"Su Shi said: 'Do not dwell on old friends and the homeland with this old heart; instead, try new tea with new fire.'"

"Li Qingzhao lamented: 'After wine, I prefer the bitterness of compressed tea; waking from dreams, the scent of Ruinao incense is most fitting.'"

"Lu You sighed: 'Upon waking, who will share the noon cup of tea with me?'"

"Xin Qiji prepared tea for guests: 'After the lamb is finished and the wine is gone, we brew tea again, aspiring to the ease of Yangzhou.'"

"The ancients are gone, but the tea's fragrance remains."

"We taste tea to understand life and grasp its truths."

She stood and bowed.

"Spring keeps its appointment; tea does not err. May you never regret it, year after year."

A moment of silence hung in the room.

Then, enthusiastic applause broke out.

"Well said!"

Mrs. Roscente listened intently.

She had built her fortune on tea and understood it deeply.

She had held little expectation for a young tea master.

Yet Sophia had astonished her.

Not only was her explanation vivid, but her skill was exceptional.

Every step was precise and perfect.

The aroma was rich, the liquor clear and bright.

Truly remarkable!

Sophia stepped down from the platform.

She approached Isabella.

"Does this prove my capability now?"

Isabella took a step back.

"It's time for you to honor your promise."

Cold sweat trickled down Isabella's back.

She looked toward Victoria Roscente for help.

But Victoria was lost in thought.

The Sophia she had just witnessed was astounding.

Quoting poetry with ease.

Her bearing was extraordinary.

Victoria had never seen this side of Sophia before.

In that moment, she suddenly understood.

What it meant to be enriched by poetry and literature from within.

Isabella bit her lip. "Fine, I apologize! Don't push your luck!"

Mrs. Roscente frowned. "Such ill manners! You were bold in your doubt, but now you wish to renege on your promise?"

The other ladies joined in.

"How dare you question someone as accomplished as Ms. Sullivan?"

"Some people simply don't know what's good for them."

The murmurs grew louder.

Victoria found herself drawn into the criticism.
###Chapter 130

Isabella Langley stood at the center of the crowd.

Countless eyes were fixed on her.

Their gazes were scrutinizing.

Full of disdain.

Victoria Roscente's face was ashen.

Her carefully maintained composure was utterly shattered.

"Apologize now!" Victoria hissed under her breath.

Isabella's fingers tightened around her skirt.

She looked at Sophia Sullivan.

Sophia remained calm.

As if watching a farce that had nothing to do with her.

"Sorry." Isabella forced the word through clenched teeth.

Sophia gave a slight nod.

She said nothing more.

Whispers began to circulate around them.

"The Roscente family has really lost all sense of decorum."

"How dare they bring her to an event like this."

Victoria's face burned with humiliation.

She shot Isabella a furious glare.

Isabella lowered her head.

Her nails dug deeply into her palms.

Nina White smiled and linked arms with Sophia.

"When did you get your tea master certification, Clara?"

Sophia smiled faintly.

"I just studied it casually in my free time."

Those six years.

She had been trapped in a gilded cage.

Aside from taking care of Ethan Roscente's daily needs.

She devoted all her time to studying.

Tea ceremony.

Flower arrangement.

Baking.

She obtained many certifications.

As if trying to hold onto something.

Her father's words echoed in her ears.

One should always learn more skills.

She never dared to rely completely on Ethan.

...

The class ended.

The ladies began presenting their results.

Sophia tasted each offering and gave her comments.

When it was Mrs. Cooper's turn.

The tea aroma was exceptionally clear and refreshing.

"Is this pre-rain Longjing?" Sophia gently inhaled the fragrance.

Mrs. Cooper smiled kindly.

"It's from our family's tea plantation."

Sophia took a sip.

The tea was clear and had a sweet aftertaste.

"Excellent tea."

Mrs. Cooper took a tea canister from her bag.

"Please take some home to enjoy, Teacher Sophia."

Sophia tried to decline but couldn't refuse.

She finally accepted it.

Sylvia Laurent absentmindedly fiddled with her tea set.

Mrs. Brown came over to take a look.

"Let me ask Teacher Sophia to taste your tea."

Before Sylvia Laurent could stop her.

Sophia had already walked over.
###Chapter 131

Mrs. Brown's eyes sparkled with excitement.

Sylvia Laurent rarely participated in such events.

Even when she did attend, it was merely for appearances.

It was a rare treat for her to personally brew tea today.

Of course, it had to be savored properly.

Sophia Sullivan approached slowly.

She looked up and her gaze met Sylvia's.

Sylvia was momentarily taken aback.

She then let out a cold snort.

Her chin lifted slightly.

Yet Sophia detected the unease beneath that haughty exterior.

Mrs. Brown smiled and offered a teacup. "Would you like to try this pot, Professor Sullivan?"

Sophia first rinsed her mouth.

Then she took a small sip.

She pondered for a moment.

She spoke honestly. "Too much tea leaves, not enough water. The liquor is too dark, the taste is bitter. The pot wasn't warmed beforehand, so the tea's aroma hasn't been fully released."

"Pfft—" Mrs. Brown burst out laughing. "I said skipping steps would affect the taste, but you insisted no one would notice. See?"

Sylvia's face darkened.

Even though Sophia was correct.

Did she have to be so blunt?

Couldn't she be more tactful?

Mrs. Brown laughed even louder. "I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up with you."

Sylvia was speechless.

Sophia remained oblivious.

She had already turned to sample the next lady's tea.

…

Victoria Roscente sat in her original spot.

She watched Sophia surrounded by a group of society ladies.

Her heart felt both sour and bitter.

She had worked hard for so many years to barely squeeze into this circle.

Yet Sophia gained everyone's recognition with such ease.

How was that fair?

What was even more infuriating was that Sophia didn't seem to care at all.

She answered each question calmly.

She evaluated each pot of tea objectively.

No flattery, no sycophancy.

Some of her critiques were even quite harsh.

But those picky women didn't seem offended at all.

Instead, they thanked her repeatedly.

Victoria was baffled. Had the world gone mad?

She then glanced at Isabella Langley shrinking nearby.

Her tea was a complete disaster.

Victoria felt even more stifled.

For the first time, she thought Sophia was far better than Isabella.

At least she wouldn't embarrass herself like this!

The tea ceremony ended at five.

Everyone left satisfied.

The moment they exited the hotel, Victoria pointed at Isabella and scolded her. "I told you to prepare properly, and this is what you came up with? Were you afraid people wouldn't know you have no class?"

"You brainless fool! How could anyone else be so unprepared? Utterly stupid!"

Isabella bit her lip, feeling wronged.

She tried to step forward and explain.

Victoria immediately backed away.

As if she were something filthy.

"Stay away from me. I can't stand stupidity! Don't let me see you for the next few days."

"I have no idea what my son sees in you…"

"Dream on if you think you can marry into the Roscente family!"

On the other side, Olivia's driver arrived.

Sylvia was about to leave.

Olivia offered. "Sister-in-law, need a ride?"

"No, thank you. I have other matters."

Olivia didn't press further.

She instructed her driver to leave.

Sophia was waiting for her car at the entrance.

People kept saying goodbye to her.

She responded to each with a smile.

Olivia knew someone was picking her up.

She hadn't arranged a driver.

Alexander Laurent was very punctual.

He arrived in ten minutes.

Actually, two minutes early.

A light drizzle began to fall.

Through the car window, he saw her not far away.

In the misty rain, Sophia stood in her qipao.

She looked like a fairy from a Jiangnan watercolor painting.

Alexander was momentarily stunned.

Collecting himself, he pulled over.

He got out with an umbrella.

After reaching her, he carefully opened the car door.

As Sophia bent to get in.

He placed a hand protectively above her head.

"Thank you."

Sophia settled into the seat.

She smiled at him. "Sorry for the trouble again, Professor Laurent."

She had originally planned to take a taxi.

But the sudden rain made it impossible to hail one.

In the pavilion diagonally across from the hotel entrance.

Sylvia waited for the valet to bring her car.

She inadvertently saw Sophia in the qipao getting into a black Volkswagen.

The distance was a bit far.

She couldn't clearly see the man's face.

But the umbrella in his hand bore a "Double R" logo.

It was the exclusive umbrella for Rolls-Royce.

Sylvia frowned and snorted coldly.

Pretty girls these days all want to land a sugar daddy.

She thought this girl was different.

Turns out…

What is wrong with these men's taste?

So eager to be taken for a fool…

…

In the car.

The supposed fool, Alexander Laurent, sneezed.

He had just gotten over a cold.

Why was he sneezing again?

As soon as Sophia got in the car, she noticed a new small pendant hanging from the rearview mirror.

A Chinese knot strung with an agarwood figurine.

Two jadeite beads dangled at the end.

It was a souvenir she brought back from the Maldives.

She said with surprise. "You hung this in your car?"

It was Alexander's first time seeing her in a qipao.

She was so beautiful he hardly dared to look directly.

Keeping his eyes on the road, he said. "Agarwood calms the mind. There's Arabic carved on the back, meaning 'safe travels.' Hanging it with a Chinese knot in the car seemed fitting."

Sophia gently touched the swaying little pendant.

She turned it over and indeed saw a string of unfamiliar script.

"So it's Arabic. I hadn't noticed before…"

"Mhm."

"You understand Arabic?"

"A little."

"How do you pronounce this?" Sophia traced the carving with her fingertip.

The man softly uttered the unfamiliar syllables.

Sophia repeated them once.

A bit awkward the first time.

Much smoother the second.

"…Was that right?"

Alexander nodded. "Very accurate."

Sophia was curious. "When did you learn Arabic?"

"Six years ago. I was reading a work by an Emirati physicist. The translation wasn't precise enough, so I spent half a year learning Arabic to read the original."

Sophia was speechless.

Learning a language just for one book?

…

Sophia still had data analysis to complete tonight.

They discussed it and decided to grab a quick bite at a casual restaurant.

Then they returned to the lab together.

The night was deep.

Only the two of them remained in the laboratory.
###Chapter 132

The night was deep and still.

The laboratory was quiet.

Alexander Laurent turned his head.

Sophia Sullivan was focused on recording data.

The light outlined her soft profile.

He was used to working late alone.

Now he had company.

This feeling was unfamiliar.

And special.

They left together in the early hours.

They said goodnight back at their building.

Sophia turned and went inside.

Alexander watched her slender figure.

He suddenly remembered the silhouette in the qipao from the afternoon rain.

The slender waist.

The pale skin.

He snapped back to reality with a low curse.

He quickly opened his door and went inside.

As if a second longer would reveal his disarray.

...

Sophia showered and fell straight asleep.

Under the same night sky.

Isabella Langley tossed and turned.

It was already 2 a.m.

Ethan Roscente still wasn't home.

Victoria Roscente's words echoed in her mind.

The more she thought, the angrier she got.

She got up abruptly and left the bedroom.

The mansion was dark and empty.

She shouted loudly.

"Where is everyone?"

Two housekeepers hurried over.

"What's wrong, Miss Langley?"

"Are you feeling unwell?"

Isabella's face was cold.

"Are you here to relax or to work?"

The housekeepers exchanged glances.

They cursed internally.

But didn't dare show it.

"What do you need, Miss Langley?"

"I want bird's nest soup."

"Now?"

Isabella sneered.

"Is that a problem?"

"...No, we'll prepare it right away."

Isabella stretched her back.

She had sat too long in class today.

She was really a little tired.

She pointed to the other housekeeper.

"Come here and give me a massage."

The housekeeper hesitated.

"Pregnant women shouldn't have random massages..."

Isabella instantly exploded.

"Just do it when you're told!"

The housekeeper swallowed her anger.

"...Please lie down."

Isabella lay on the couch.

"You only listen after being scolded."

The housekeeper paused.

She gritted her teeth silently.

"Too light!"

"...Is this better?"

"Trying to kill me with pain?"

Half an hour later, the bird's nest was served.

It was translucent and fragrant.

Isabella took a sip and frowned.

"The taste is off."

The housekeeper quickly explained.

"I've been preparing bird's nest for twenty years..."

Isabella sneered.

"Using inferior products?"

The housekeeper trembled with anger.

"You can call the police!"

Isabella's eyes flickered.

She just wanted to vent her anger.

"What's all the noise?"

Ethan returned smelling of alcohol.

Isabella immediately changed her expression and approached him.

"You're back, Ethan..."

Ethan coldly pushed her away.

"Stay away from me, can't you understand?"

He took two steps back.

His eyes full of disgust.

Isabella's smile froze.

Ethan turned and went upstairs.

Isabella's face twisted.

She yelled at the housekeepers.

"What are you looking at? Get out!"

...

Isabella brought up sobering soup.

She found the master bedroom door ajar.

The sound of water came from the bathroom.

She gently put down the tray.

She crept closer.

Ethan stood under the water.

He suddenly saw a shadow on the frosted glass door.

He narrowed his eyes.

A cold glint flashed.
###Chapter 133
Ethan turned off the shower.

The water stopped abruptly.

He grabbed his robe and put it on.

There was a faint noise outside the door.

A dark shadow moved close to the doorframe.

He yanked the door open.

Isabella stumbled inside, caught off guard.

"Who said you could come in?"

A storm brewed in his eyes.

"I warned you. Never enter this room."

He stepped closer.

Isabella's fingers trembled. "I brought you sobering soup..."

"Stop pretending," Ethan sneered. "A few nights in my bed and you forget your place?"

He leaned down and gripped her chin.

"Women like you are a dime a dozen."

"You all come running when I call."

"What makes you any different?"

Her face turned pale.

He released her, his voice full of disgust. "I wouldn't look twice if you stood here naked."

"Want to know why?"

She covered her ears, shaking her head wildly.

Tears streamed down her face.

"Stop... please stop..."

"Then get out." He shoved her away. "The sight of you sickens me."

The tray clattered to the floor.

The soup bowl shattered.

Isabella staggered out of the room.

She lay awake all night.

Her pillow was soaked with tears.

Why?

She was carrying his child.

Yet he despised her even more.

Was he... still thinking about Sophia?

The thought drove her mad.

She kicked over the nightstand.

The crash echoed outside.

Martha had just finished cleaning the master bedroom.

Now she heard noise from the second bedroom.

Annoyed, she knocked. "Miss Langley? Mrs. Roscente requests your presence for breakfast."

Silence.

Martha frowned and turned to leave.

The door flew open.

Isabella was curled on the floor, clutching her stomach.

"Martha... my stomach... it hurts so much..."

She was pale, drenched in cold sweat.

Martha fumbled for her phone. "The driver is off today! I'll call an ambulance!"

Another maid rushed over.

She immediately called Victoria.

The mansion descended into chaos.

The ambulance arrived half an hour later.

Isabella was carried out on a stretcher.

Everyone finally breathed a sigh of relief.

...

In the hospital emergency room.

Victoria rushed in.

"How is my grandson?"

The doctor put away his stethoscope. "False contractions caused by emotional stress. She needs to remain calm."

"Does she need medication?"

"Unnecessary." The doctor shook his head. "Just rest at home."

Victoria glared at the hospital bed.

Isabella shrank back, avoiding her gaze.

She had gotten so angry her stomach hurt.

It was a false alarm.

"Behave!" Victoria hissed quietly. "Keep causing trouble and you'll regret it!"

She stormed out, slamming the door.

...

In the laboratory.

Sophia received a call from Professor Watson.

"Come by the house next week. I want to introduce you to someone."

The professor's voice sounded weak.

Sophia sensed something was wrong.

She was free this week.

Why wait until next?

She went straight to the professor's house that afternoon.

She used her spare key to open the door.

The smell of herbal medicine filled the air.

The housekeeper, Jade, turned in surprise. "Sophia? The professor said you were coming next week..."

Eleanor Watson emerged, leaning on a cane.

"And you call this 'fine'?" Sophia's face darkened.

The professor gave an awkward smile. "An old issue. My rheumatism is acting up."

Sophia rolled up her pant leg.

Her calf was swollen and shiny.

"You call this a 'small issue'?" Her voice trembled. "Which hospital did you go to? I need to speak with the doctor!"

"Alright, alright, I admit I was wrong." Eleanor sighed. "I just didn't want to waste time at the hospital."

She ruffled Sophia's hair.

"The lab is much more interesting than any hospital."

"You understand, don't you?"
###Chapter 134

Sophia Sullivan's eyes stung.

She understood Eleanor Watson's choice.

Scientific research was the most important thing in Eleanor's life.

She didn't care how long she lived.

She only cared about how far she could go in her field.

Even if it consumed her life.

Even if the path ahead was difficult.

She was willing to immerse herself in the long river of science.

To become a foundation for future generations.

To light the way forward.

"Why are your eyes red again?"

Eleanor hated emotional scenes.

Sophia rubbed her nose. "I'm not crying. I wouldn't cry."

"Alright, you're not crying." Eleanor shook her head with a smile.

"Let me give you a massage."

Sophia stopped trying to persuade her.

She sat down and gently pressed Eleanor's calves.

Soon, Eleanor felt much more relaxed.

"Your rheumatism is worse because of the erratic weather. I ordered medicinal packs. The delivery should arrive soon. Remember to soak your feet daily."

"I know."

Eleanor pointed to the desk. "Take that number."

"?"

"Do you remember Benjamin Murphy?"

Sophia exclaimed, "Professor Murphy?!"

"Yes. He found out you're back for grad school. He's angry I didn't tell him. I can't calm him down. You call and soothe him. He listens to you."

Sophia fell silent. Professor Murphy's temper... How could she possibly calm him down?

Bioinformatics required using computers to process biological data.

It demanded high proficiency in information science.

Programming was frequently used.

That's why, back when Ethan Roscente was kicked out and they lived in a basement, Sophia could write programs to help him earn his first startup capital.

During her undergraduate years, Eleanor had arranged a computer science mentor for her—Benjamin Murphy.

After ensuring Professor Watson soaked her feet, took medicine, and making her a meal, Sophia finally went home.

At home, she took out the slip of paper and dialed.

First call: hung up.

Second call: same.

Third call: finally answered.

"Hmph! Who is this?" An old man's voice, full of pride.

Sophia couldn't help but laugh. That "hmph" gave everything away.

She deliberately said, "Sorry, wrong number. Goodbye—"

"Sophia Sullivan!" he immediately broke character.

"Professor Murphy..."

"Don't you dare hang up!"

"...I wouldn't. I'm sorry."

"You came back and only went to see Eleanor? Am I not your mentor? Why didn't you apply for my program for grad school?"

"Professor Murphy, my undergrad was in bioinformatics..."

"So what? You have talent in computing too. What's wrong with changing fields? Isn't it allowed?"

"...It's allowed."

"Hmph!"

After finally coaxing the old man, Sophia breathed a sigh of relief.

He suddenly asked, "Have you forgotten everything I taught you all these years?"

"Absolutely not."

"Words aren't enough. I need proof."

Sophia: "?"

The old man kept her coding all night.

As dawn approached, Benjamin said, "Ahem! That's enough for today. I've got this semester's test questions and answers now. Good."

Sophia: "??" Doesn't your conscience hurt?

She dozed for an hour. When she opened her eyes, it was already 8 AM. She hurriedly got ready and rushed to the lab.

Alexander Laurent was surprised to see her half an hour late, looking displeased. "Didn't sleep well?"

Sophia shook her head. "Not 'didn't sleep well.' Didn't sleep at all."

Alexander raised an eyebrow but didn't ask further.

Sophia patted her cheeks, forcing herself to focus.

Time to work!

After lunch, Sophia was yawning incessantly.

Noticing this, Alexander said, "Don't push yourself too hard. Go nap in the lounge?"

Too exhausted to refuse, Sophia agreed.

Alexander continued working. Two hours later, passing the lounge, he remembered Sophia was inside. He knocked first. No response. "...Sophia? Are you okay? I'm coming in?"

Worried something was wrong, he gently pushed the door open. The girl was curled up in a ball, breathing evenly, just sleeping very soundly.

He breathed a sigh of relief and couldn't help but smile.

Just like a little kitten.

Quiet and beautiful.

...

Isabella Langley stayed in the hospital for two days and couldn't stand it anymore, demanding to be discharged.

The nanny couldn't make the decision. She called Ethan Roscente, but he hung up immediately.

She had to call Victoria Roscente.

Victoria launched into another tirade over the phone. "...Don't think being pregnant lets you do whatever you want. If you want to die, keep acting up. You'd better pray nothing happens to that baby, or you'll regret it!"

Isabella listened, gritting her teeth, not daring to talk back.

Finally, Victoria agreed to the discharge but warned, "This is the last time. Take good care of that stomach!"

Returning to the Beverly Hills mansion, the staff had just enjoyed two peaceful days. The plague was back.

They wanted to cry!

Especially Martha!

When Isabella walked in, Martha jolted awake from her small bed in the storage room, looking utterly defeated. "I just fell asleep!"

Isabella had barely arrived home when the family doctor arranged by Victoria showed up.

He strictly set a schedule and created a special diet. It was bland, nothing but bland.

She wanted to rebel but didn't even have the courage to make a phone call.

"I'm going out! Now!" she yelled at the servants, venting her frustration.

The driver was ready quickly. She got in the car, and two nannies followed.

"What are you doing?"

"Madam's orders. We are not to leave your side, Miss Langley. To ensure you and the baby's safety."

Isabella was going insane.

She had the driver stop at a mall entrance, rushed in, grabbing the most expensive items she saw, swiping Ethan's secondary card wildly.

She bought clothes and bags, things she usually couldn't afford or dare to buy.

She threw all the bags to the two nannies to carry. "Come on, aren't you supposed to stick close? Hurry up!"

The two nannies complained internally but resigned themselves to carrying the numerous bags and following.

At that moment, they just wanted to say: Martha, we feel your pain.

In the conference room, Ethan listened to the department manager's quarterly summary.

His phone on the table vibrated incessantly.

Everyone glanced at him, intentionally or not.

Ethan picked up his phone and scanned it. All spending alerts.
###Chapter 135

Ethan's head throbbed with a splitting pain.

He irritably silenced his phone and slammed it face down on the desk.

"Continue."

Everyone in the conference room held their breath, not daring to speak.

After the meeting, he returned to his office and noticed his phone screen lighting up.

Purchase notifications popped up one after another.

Isabella was using his supplementary card.

Every transaction was instantly reported to him.

The messages kept pouring in.

A vein throbbed at Ethan's temple.

Just as he was about to put the phone down, a WeChat tone sounded.

[Ethan, look at all the things I bought! Do you like them? I got you a tie and a coat too.]

He snorted coldly and blocked her immediately.

Walking to the floor-to-ceiling window, he watched the endless stream of traffic below.

Sophia's figure surfaced in his mind once again.

Lately, he'd been thinking of her more and more.

Even in his dreams.

He had given Sophia a Black Card before.

Aside from basic expenses and gifts for Victoria, she hardly ever used his money.

He knew she wrote programs and took on side jobs.

But he wasn't sure exactly how much she earned.

She rarely bought designer brands.

The jewelry and handbags in her closet were all bought by him.

She never touched them unless it was for a necessary occasion.

After the breakup, she left everything at the mansion.

She didn't take a single thing.

She discarded it all as if it were trash.

Isabella's constant presence was a relentless reminder.

He had lost something incredibly precious.

And what he got in return was this miserable outcome.

...

At the mall.

Isabella stared at the rejected message.

He had actually blocked her!

Her face flushed red with anger, her breathing became rapid.

Her stomach suddenly tightened, and she quickly took deep breaths to calm down.

She pointed at the two nannies and ordered, "Go downstairs and buy me coconut water."

"I'll go. She can stay here to watch the things."

"I said both of you go!" Isabella raised her voice. "Can't you understand me?"

"But all these—"

"Carry them!"

The two nannies exchanged a look, furious but not daring to speak.

This was obviously just to hassle them.

Isabella didn't care.

The frustration she felt from Ethan and Victoria had to be taken out on someone.

...

Ethan didn't come home again that night.

Isabella laughed and cried amidst a room full of shopping bags.

She started smashing things.

Martha turned over in her room, pulled the quilt over her head.

Let her smash it. She'd clean it all up in the morning.

The other two nannies had seen it coming.

They had asked for leave and slipped away after returning from the mall.

One said her back hurt and she needed to go to the hospital.

The other said her grandson had no one to look after him.

When Isabella rushed out of her bedroom, disheveled and screaming, she found the mansion empty.

She froze for two seconds, then began to shriek.

"Lin!"

"Martha!"

"Where are you all hiding!"

"I want bird's nest soup!"

"My stomach hurts!"

Realizing no one was paying attention, she finally quieted down.

She slammed the door shut in a rage.

...

Early the next morning.

Before Martha could even change into her uniform, she heard screaming from upstairs.

"Someone! Take me to the hospital!"

Martha's mouth twitched. She  picked up the phone and called the driver.

"Omelas, she has a stomach ache again."

Then she called Victoria.

"Madam, it's like this..."

The entire process was smooth and practiced.

...

In the hospital corridor.

Victoria listened to the doctor repeat the same words with a cold face.

"Nothing serious. She just needs more rest."

She couldn't take it anymore and stormed into the hospital room.

"You come running to the hospital for every little thing? Do you think this is a grocery market?"

"Is your head just for decoration?"

"I've never seen anyone so difficult. You can't even manage to rest properly during pregnancy. What use are you!"

She remembered when Sophia was around.

Not only did she take good care of Ethan, she never caused any trouble for Victoria.

She solved her own problems, and if she couldn't, she discussed it properly.

Then look at the one on the bed.

Noisier than a cricket, more annoying than a cockroach.

Turning a minor issue into a huge drama.

Does she really think the whole world revolves around her?

Pah—

What a piece of work!

Isabella let Victoria's words go in one ear and out the other.

She was discharged in the afternoon, but the next morning, she was clamoring to go back to the hospital.

At first, Victoria still answered Martha's calls.

Later, she simply instructed,

"You handle it. You don't need to call me every time."

Martha was speechless.

This household would fall apart without me!

Victoria finally had some peace and quiet.

If she wants to make trouble, let her. Someone else can deal with her.

...

The third day of the fifth lunar month, Olivia's birthday.

The gift Sophia prepared finally arrived.

It was the "Eternal Starlight" diamond necklace Olivia had been dreaming of.

A piece by the famous designer Cherry Xia.

The pure blue diamond was the soul of the collection, symbolizing hope.

In the globally popular film The Princess Diaries, this necklace was the token of love.

The movie's success made the necklace sell out.

It was impossible to find domestically.

Sophia had someone purchase it for her in Belgium.

Olivia couldn't wait for Sophia to help her put it on.

"It's so beautiful! No wonder it's sold out everywhere. I went to the boutique several times, and they always said it was out of stock."

She was wearing an off-the-shoulder mermaid gown today. The light blue color complemented the necklace perfectly.

...

At a leisure club.

Victoria was having afternoon tea with several other ladies.

Large terrace, floor-to-ceiling windows, soft music, exquisite desserts.

Ever since she stopped paying attention to Isabella's dramas, she felt the world was brighter.

Occasionally, she would wonder.

Was insisting on keeping this child the right decision?
###Chapter 136

Ethan Roscente didn't care about this child at all.

Moreover…

Julian Roscente still didn't know Isabella Langley was pregnant.

Victoria Roscente didn't dare mention it in front of him.

She knew Julian's temper too well.

This father and son were equally cold-blooded.

Things had progressed to this point.

An abortion was no longer possible.

She had no choice but to accept this child.

"Mrs. Lowell, I heard your daughter-in-law is expecting twins? Such wonderful news!"

"Yes, the young couple kept it a complete secret. They only told me after the pregnancy stabilized, said it was a surprise. What a surprise indeed!"

"Congratulations! My son doesn't even have a girlfriend yet, it's so worrying. Mrs. Roscente, your son is around the same age as mine, right? Is he seeing anyone?"

Victoria forced a smile. "Him? He's always busy with his company, no time for romance. He should just come back and inherit the family business, but he insists on doing his own thing."

"Mrs. Roscente, you're too modest. Your son's company has already gone public, and you call that 'doing his own thing'?"

A flicker of pride crossed Victoria's eyes, but she said, "It's nothing compared to your Weichen. I heard he spends every day with his wife since she got pregnant. So attentive."

"Attentive, my foot! Hovering around his wife all day, neglecting his career. I'm just pinning my hopes on my grandson having a bright future now."

"The child isn't even born yet, and you're already pinning hopes on him?"

"You just don't get it. The latest international research shows fetuses can receive education in the womb. I specially signed my daughter-in up for a top-tier prenatal class. You have to start with the mother to cultivate an exceptional child."

"The mother needs training too?"

"Of course! How can an unexceptional mother give birth to an exceptional child?"

The words were spoken casually, but Victoria listened intently.

A thought sparked in her mind.

After the gathering ended, she returned home and immediately summoned the housekeeper.

"Contact this prenatal studio. Enroll Isabella Langley. The fees will come from me. Don't let Mr. Roscente know."

The housekeeper understood perfectly.

Half an hour later, the housekeeper reported back. "She's enrolled."

Victoria picked up her phone and called Isabella Langley.

The phone rang for a long time before it was answered.

"Who is it?" Isabella's voice was thick with sleep.

Victoria's face darkened. "It's me."

Isabella replied lazily, "Oh, it's you, Auntie. What is it?"

Victoria suppressed her anger. "I've enrolled you in a prenatal class. It starts tomorrow. The classes are very relaxed, things like flower arranging, tea tasting…"

Isabella was eating an orange. She refused without a second thought. "Auntie, I haven't been feeling well lately. I have frequent hospital appointments. I really don't have the energy for classes."

Victoria was so angry her liver ached.

Was this bitch not even bothering to pretend anymore?

"You must go!"

Before she could finish, the call was disconnected.

Victoria stared at her phone in disbelief.

She actually hung up on her!

If she was this arrogant before the child was even born, what would she be like afterwards?

Victoria called the housekeeper again. "Go tell Isabella Langley if she doesn't attend the classes, she can get out of the Roscente family, along with the bastard in her belly!"

At nine that evening, the housekeeper returned with his report.

"Miss Langley says she will attend the classes on time."

"She knows what's good for her!"

…

Early the next morning, Isabella was woken by her phone ringing.

She answered groggily. "Hello?"

"Miss Langley, hello. I'm a teacher from the prenatal center. The first class starts at eight. You should set off now. Mrs. Roscente specifically said if you miss class, she will come personally to invite you."

Isabella remembered the housekeeper's warning.

She gritted her teeth and got out of bed.

During breakfast, she opened the class schedule and nearly spat out her milk.

From 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., the schedule was packed.

Wardrobe coordination, social etiquette, Western dining and desserts, jewelry appreciation…

Every fiber of her being rejected it.

But thinking of Victoria's threat, she steeled herself and went out.

From that day on, Isabella began her life of early departures and late returns for prenatal classes.

She came back exhausted after class every day, and still had to find time to attend university.

Her previous unexplained absences had already earned her a warning from her academic advisor.

Isabella had no choice but to obediently return to class.

But she still only showed up sporadically.

She usually paid someone to sign in for her, relied on her roommates to cover for her, and only occasionally showed her face.

Now, with her time consumed by prenatal classes and having to juggle both, she quickly reached her limit.

Isabella didn't hesitate for long before making her decision.

She would drop out.
###Chapter 137

Isabella Langley stood in the center of her dorm room.

She glanced around.

All her roommates were present.

Madison Klein noticed her first.

"Isabella? You're back?"

A faint smile touched Isabella's lips.

"I came to pack my things."

Her tone was light.

"I've withdrawn from school."

Her roommates froze.

The air turned still.

Isabella was dressed impeccably today.

A Chanel sweater.

A Burberry trench coat.

An Hermès bag in her hand.

She radiated brilliance.

A stark contrast to the dorm's humble surroundings.

Madison couldn't hold back.

"Dropping out is a big decision. Maybe you should reconsider?"

Another roommate chimed in.

"Yeah, you've already done two years. It's a shame to quit now."

Isabella gave a soft laugh.

"It's no shame at all."

She lowered her voice.

"I'm pregnant."

The roommates exchanged uneasy glances.

"I'm marrying into the Roscente family soon."

"Taking care of the baby is my priority now."

Madison frowned.

"Does your family know?"

Isabella turned her face away.

"My decisions are my own."

She surveyed her old belongings.

The makeup was cheap.

The clothes were outdated.

Nothing suited her new status.

"You can do whatever you want with this stuff."

"Just throw it out if you don't need it."

Her roommates fell silent.

Isabella left the dorm empty-handed.

Her chauffeur waited punctually at the campus gate.

She slid into the luxury car's back seat.

The vehicle sped away under everyone's gaze.

Ethan Roscente came home unusually early that evening.

Isabella hurried to greet him.

"Ethan, I've left school."

Her voice was soft and sweet.

"Now I can focus entirely on you and the baby."

Ethan had just removed his coat.

He paused mid-motion.

His gaze turned icy.

"What does you dropping out have to do with me?"

Isabella's eyes welled with tears.

"It was all for you and the child..."

Ethan scoffed.

"Don't use me as an excuse."

He turned to leave.

"Your choices are your own responsibility."

Isabella stood frozen in place.

Ethan thought of Sophia Sullivan.

A wave of irritation washed over him.

He had been such a fool.

...

The June weather grew warmer.

Sophia Sullivan woke early.

The succulents on her balcony were thriving.

The rose bushes were in full bloom.

She had been busy with experiments lately.

She hadn't paid much attention to her plants.

Today, she finally had some free time.

She carefully watered and loosened the soil.

She fed her small fish.

She arrived at the laboratory on time.

Dr. Zoe Langley was late.

She looked exhausted.

"I broke two bowls this morning."

"Then I almost got into an accident dropping the kids off."

Professor Quincy Evans teased.

"You actually believe in that superstition?"

Zoe sighed.

"My elderly relative is in the hospital. Their rheumatism is acting up badly."

Sophia's hand holding the test tube hesitated slightly.
###Chapter 138

"Is it a gout flare-up, Dr. Langley?"

"How did you know?"

"Professor Watson has the same condition. I have a herbal remedy. It can't cure it, but it's excellent for pain relief. Fewer side effects than Western medicine too."

Dr. Zoe Langley's dull eyes instantly brightened. "Wonderful! Please send me the prescription. I'll get the herbs after work. Thank you so much."

"You have no idea. My mother-in-law is in so much pain she can't sleep. Painkillers aren't working. I've been so worried. If this prescription works, I'll be deeply grateful."

Sophia Sullivan offered a gentle smile. "It was nothing. Please, don't mention it."

Professor Quincy Evans adjusted his glasses. "Have you noticed? Since Sophia joined the lab, every problem finds a solution. She's our little lucky charm."

Dr. Simon Lowell walked in, catching only the last few words. "Lucky charm?"

Dr. Langley laughed. "We're talking about Sophia. So clever and capable. Like a good luck charm."

Simon was about to nod in agreement when Lillian Lopez shot up from her seat. Her face was pale.

"Someone's been on my computer! All the experimental data on my hard drive is gone!"

"What?"

"Another virus? That can't be..." Professor Evans immediately returned to his own terminal to check. "IT just upgraded the firewall. It shouldn't be possible..."

Dr. Langley also hurriedly opened her computer.

The lab atmosphere instantly grew tense.

Professor Evans: "My data is fine. Nothing missing. Dr. Langley?"

Dr. Langley: "Mine is okay too."

They both looked at Simon and Sophia.

Simon: "Everything's normal here."

Sophia: "My data is all present."

Only Lillian's data was missing.

Dr. Langley: "Check again. Are you sure it wasn't saved somewhere else?"

Lillian frowned deeply. "I've searched every drive. It's not there."

They exchanged uneasy glances.

"How is this possible? Everyone else's data is fine. Only yours is missing. It doesn't make sense."

Lillian's voice was low. "The computer is fine. That specific data was deleted."

"...What do you mean?" A cold dread settled in Professor Evans's stomach.

"It means," Lillian took a deep breath, "my data was intentionally deleted!"

Dead silence filled the room.

Professor Evans's expression turned grave. "Lillian, you need evidence for an accusation like that."

"Professor Evans, I don't want to suspect anyone. There are only a few of us in the lab. Suspecting anyone is unpleasant. But I can't think of any other reason why only my data is gone."

"This..." Dr. Langley trailed off, hesitant.

Professor Evans also fell silent.

Lillian's theory was the most logical, but also the most serious.

Professor Evans: "Who do you suspect?"

The question made everyone tense up.

Lillian's gaze swept over them, finally landing on Sophia.

"Nothing like this ever happened in the lab before she arrived. Problems started piling up since she came. Isn't my suspicion reasonable?"

The accusation pointed directly at Sophia.

Sophia looked up, meeting Lillian's eyes directly. Lillian was the first to look away.

Dr. Langley pondered for a moment. She usually remained neutral in such situations. But this time—

"Intentionally deleting data is a serious offense. I trust Sophia's character. There might be a misunderstanding. We shouldn't jump to conclusions."

Lillian was taken aback. She hadn't expected the typically neutral Dr. Langley to be the first to defend Sophia.

Professor Evans also nodded. "Sophia is meticulous and thoughtful. She wouldn't do something like this. I don't believe it."

Simon's eyes flickered. He hesitated, remaining silent.

Seeing everyone side with Sophia, Lillian felt furious but didn't dare show it. "It's hard to judge a person's heart by their appearance. Who knows what she's really like? What if it's all an act?"

"The data was there yesterday morning when I checked. Today it's gone. Dr. Langley and Professor Evans left first yesterday afternoon. Simon and I left later. Only Sophia and Professor Laurent were left last."

"Professor Laurent has no reason to do it. That only leaves Sophia!"

Lillian was aggressive. Her logic seemed sound.

But Sophia spotted a flaw. She looked at Lillian, enunciating each word clearly. "You said you checked the data yesterday morning. Did you check it again before you left yesterday?"

"Of course! The data was there!"

"Are you certain?"

Lillian: "I'm absolutely certain. Why are you asking? Do you think I'm framing you?"

Sophia remained calm. "Alright. According to your statement, the data disappeared sometime after you left yesterday and before you arrived today. Correct?"

"Correct."

"Then let's check the surveillance footage from that period."

Dr. Langley nodded. "Right, the surveillance! I almost forgot. The lab has 24-hour monitoring."

"Fine," Lillian sneered. "Let's check the footage. That way, no one can say I'm targeting anyone."

They went to the security control room. Professor Evans asked the guard to pull up the footage from the last two days.

The result was unexpected.

The footage was missing.

Dr. Langley: "What's going on? How can the surveillance footage be gone?"

The guard was also puzzled. "The footage from the last month is all here. Only yesterday's and the day before's are missing. It's very strange..."

"Isn't it obvious? Someone deliberately deleted the key surveillance footage! No wonder she was so quick to suggest checking it. She was prepared!"

Lillian crossed her arms, all but pointing her finger at Sophia.

Alexander Laurent arrived at the lab after his class. Finding it empty, he asked the guard and located them in the control room.

His calm, dark eyes swept over the group. "What's going on? Why is everyone here?"

Lillian spoke first, her voice full of grievance. "Professor, my experimental data was maliciously deleted. It took me a whole week to compile that data. I was waiting to upload it to the system. Today, it's all gone."

She grew more upset, her voice trembling with unshed tears.

"Sophia was the last to leave the lab both these days. Last night's surveillance is missing. She's the prime suspect! I have reason to believe she deleted my data."

Dr. Langley and Professor Evans, afraid Professor Laurent would believe her, quickly interjected.

"Professor, the matter isn't clear yet."

"We believe Sophia isn't that kind of person."

Nearby, Simon was unusually quiet. He frowned, remaining silent the entire time.

They had left work together these past few days. They went shopping and had meals. Lillian simply didn't have the time to complete that set of data...

Simon glanced at the woman. For the first time, she seemed somewhat unfamiliar.

Professor Laurent asked very detailed questions. The time of data loss, the storage location, whether there was a backup.

Lillian answered each one. The details aligned.

This made Sophia's doubt seem even greater.

Dr. Langley and Professor Evans wanted to defend her but didn't know how. They could only watch anxiously.

Just then, Sophia, at the center of the storm, slowly lifted her eyes. She calmly scanned everyone present, her gaze finally settling on Lillian's face.

"Finding out who deleted the data isn't that difficult."
###Chapter 139

Alexander Laurent: She Doesn't Need to Prove Herself.

Professor Quincy Evans frowned deeply. "Do you have a solution?"

"Directly restore the deleted experimental data. Check the deletion logs to determine the exact time the data was deleted. Then investigate everyone who was in the lab during that timeframe."

Quincy sighed. "The logic is sound, but data recovery is extremely difficult. The recycle bin has been emptied."

Sophia Sullivan's fingertips lightly touched the keyboard. "Let me try."

She hadn't wanted to intervene initially. Data recovery was time-consuming and labor-intensive. Checking the surveillance footage was the fastest method.

But given the current situation, the cameras could no longer provide a solution.

Just as Sophia sat down, Alexander Laurent suddenly placed his hand over hers.

All eyes turned to them, filled with confusion.

Alexander's voice was calm. "First, there is no concrete evidence pointing to Sophia Sullivan. All suspicion is based solely on Lillian Lopez's one-sided account."

"It's like someone losing their wallet on the street. You can't demand someone prove their innocence just because they look suspicious."

"They would just think you're being ridiculous."

"Sophia," Alexander gazed at her, "You have the ability to uncover the truth. But you don't need to fall into the trap of proving yourself."

Sophia felt a slight tremor in her heart, impressed by the man's powerful logical thinking.

Dr. Zoe Langley suddenly understood. "Right, why should Sophia have to prove herself? The burden of proof lies with the accuser."

Everyone looked at Lillian Lopez.

The smile on her lips froze. Her face gradually paled.

"I was just raising a suspicion..." Her voice trembled. "I never said it was definitely her."

Alexander took out his phone. "Then let's handle this by calling the police."

Zoe nodded. "Agreed."

Quincy raised his hand. "I have no objections."

Alexander pressed the call button for the emergency number.

Lillian's fingers clenched. Her lips turned white, and fine beads of sweat appeared on her forehead.

Just before the call connected, Dr. Simon Lowell suddenly stepped forward—

"Wait... I used Lillian's computer yesterday afternoon. I might have accidentally deleted the data folder when I was clearing out documents."

He scratched his head apologetically. "It was all my mistake. I've caused everyone so much trouble. I'm sorry..."

Simon turned to Lillian. "I'm really sorry you have to redo the data."

Lillian nodded stiffly. "...It's fine."

Zoe's eyes moved between the two of them. "Since it was a misunderstanding, it's good it's cleared up. Simon, be more careful in the future."

"Absolutely, definitely."

Sophia turned away calmly. "If there's nothing else, I'll be leaving." She didn't offer to help Lillian recover the data.

If you repay kindness with resentment, what do you use to repay kindness?

As she turned, she met Alexander's concerned gaze. The corner of her mouth twitched, silently forming two words.

Thank you.

...

At eight in the evening, Alexander took everyone out for a late-night snack.

"The barbecue here is especially good, Sophia. Try the fiery beef. I'll order extra skewers for you."

Zoe enthusiastically recommended.

Quincy sat down to Sophia's left, poured tea, and pushed it towards her. "The hot weather can cause irritation. Have some tea first. The side dishes over there are good too. The pickles are very appetizing. Want to try some?"

Sophia was both amused and exasperated by their sudden enthusiasm. She guessed they felt bad about what happened during the day.

Lillian watched this scene in silence, her lips pressed tighter and tighter.

She used to be the one everyone cared for. Ever since Sophia appeared, everything had changed...

"It's a bit stuffy. I'm going out for some air." She got up and left.

Simon noticed Lillian seemed upset and followed her off.

The alley was hung with lanterns, a popular spot for social media photos. Lillian walked aimlessly. Simon followed silently behind her.

Lillian whirled around. "Haven't you followed enough? How annoying! I just want to be alone!"

Simon was silent for a moment, then slowly looked up. "Lillian, did you really lose your data?"

Lillian's eyes darted away. "What do you mean?"

"We left right after work these past few days. You didn't have time to run experiments, let alone produce data."

"Simon Lowell, what exactly are you trying to do?!" Her voice rose, filled with anger.

"I want to say, you shouldn't have done this."

Lillian bit her lip, her voice choking up. "You suspect me?"

"It's my data. What reason would I have to take such a risk?"

Simon's gaze was intense. "That's exactly why I don't understand why you did it."

Lillian avoided his eyes. "I'm the victim. Instead of helping me find the real culprit, you're here interrogating me..."

Simon frowned. "I took the blame willingly, but we both know how sincere that was. I just want the truth."

Lillian, ashamed into anger, snapped, "So what if I did it? Go report me! Do it now! I don't need your fake concern!"

Simon was stunned. "...Why?"

"Everything was fine before she came! Now everything's changed! Professor Laurent, Dr. Langley, Professor Evans, and even you... all you see is Sophia Sullivan!"

"She's so perfect, so outstanding! I'm sick of hearing her name! I just wanted things to go back to normal. Is that so wrong?"

Lillian's emotions spiraled out of control, bursting forth like a broken dam.

Simon looked at her wounded expression, his heart softening. The words spilled out before he could stop them. "Lillian, I like you. Be with me."
###Chapter 140

Professor Quincy Evans, Dr. Zoe Langley, and Professor Alexander Laurent all pay attention to Sophia Sullivan.

But I am not them.

My eyes only see you.

I will always stand by your side.

You are the most important person in my life.

I really like you.

Give me a chance.

Let me protect you openly.

Let me stand beside you.

Dr. Simon Lowell has liked Lillian Lopez since the day she joined the lab.

She is passionate and lively.

She is talented and comes from a good family.

She is completely different from him.

It was natural for him to be drawn to her.

He pursued her for a long time.

She never agreed.

But now he wants to try one more time.

Lillian does not see the deep affection in the boy's eyes.

She only suspects Simon's motives.

Is this a threat?

Is he forcing her?

If she doesn't agree, will he reveal everything?

Fear grips her heart.

Leaving the lab means losing Alexander Laurent forever.

She doesn't dare to gamble.

Lil? It's okay if you don't agree.

Simon scratches his head.

The two things aren't related anyway.

He just felt the moment was right to say it.

He understands why she dislikes Sophia.

But she shouldn't do that again.

If Professor Laurent finds out, the consequences will be severe.

The speaker means no harm, but the listener takes it to heart.

Lillian's gaze turns cold.

So he is threatening her.

Fine, I agree.

What? He was prepared for rejection but heard...

I said I agree to date you.

That's great, Lil! Thank you!

I'll treat you well, I promise!

Simon is overjoyed.

He doesn't notice the reluctance on Lillian's face.

He knows her feelings for him aren't deep.

But he believes effort can warm a stone heart.

…

The two return to the food stall holding hands.

Simon is grinning from ear to ear.

Zoe's eyes fall on their clasped hands.

Well, well, well. What's going on here?

Simon announces with a silly smile.

Lil agreed to my confession.

We're officially together now.

Zoe blinks and congratulates them.

Finally got your wish.

Hehe…

Quincy Evans, you sly dog! You did it!

Simon's attitude is obvious.

Sophia noticed it on the first day.

Lillian had always been lukewarm.

Unexpectedly, things took a sudden turn for the better.

Sophia smiles and offers her sincere blessings.

Alexander laughs and congratulates them, asking the vendor to add more dishes to celebrate.

Lillian watches for Alexander's reaction.

He isn't upset; his smile is even wider.

Her anxious heart finally sinks.

…

The late-night snack ends at half past ten.

Everyone goes their separate ways.

Sophia and Alexander head home.

The food stall is near MIT.

Alexander didn't drive, and it's still early.

Sophia suggests a walk to digest.

They walk along the riverbank, neon lights shimmering on both shores.

The city suddenly grows quiet.

The pace of time slows down.

They walk side by side in a comfortable silence.

It's not awkward, but a mutual understanding.

Being by his side is the most comfortable state.

Want to go to the bridge to feel the breeze?

Sophia speaks, tucking a stray strand of hair behind her ear.

Alexander follows her gaze.

Sure, but it's a bit far.

Getting tired already?

Sophia jokes.

Alexander raises an eyebrow. Race you there?

He finds it amusing that they're acting so childish in their fifties.

Sophia is eager.

Whoever loses buys ice cream.

Olivia Lopez would tease her for only wanting ice cream.

He wouldn't blink at something more expensive.

Alexander nods seriously. Okay.

Count of three. Three, two, one—

Sophia takes off running.

Alexander follows at a leisurely pace.

Not too close, but not too far either.

She runs to the bridge in one breath, panting heavily, her eyes shining.

She looks back, laughing like a proud little fox.

Professor, I won!

Alexander walks to the convenience store and points to the ice cream freezer.

What flavor do you want?

Strawberry, please.

Alexander picks one out.

They sit by the roadside eating their ice cream.

Enjoying the exhilaration after exercise.

There are no stars tonight.

Sophia looks at the dark sky, her tone regretful.

It was easy to see stars as a child.

So she rarely looked up.

Because it was easy, she didn't need to make a special effort; she could see them anytime.

She rests her elbows on her knees, chin in her hands.

Recalling fragmented memories.

She was excellent and sensible since childhood, the model child others talked about.

Her parents didn't restrict or interfere.

David Sullivan was busy, unable to make time even during holidays.

Yet he still fulfilled his daughter's small wishes, treating her like a princess.

But he was strict when it came to education.

Isabella Sullivan had simple demands, almost no requirements.

She could play wildly, step in puddles in the rain, and become a muddy mess.

As long as she was alive and well.

Her mom could always guess where she hid her allowance.

She could also accurately find her dad's secret stash, never failing once.

Talking about her childhood, Sophia laughs happily.

Her eyes curve like crescent moons, bright as the Milky Way, gesturing as she speaks.

The warm yellow light from the streetlamp spills over her.

Alexander watches quietly, a smile on his lips.

Unconsciously drawn to this light.

The next second, he would drown in it.

He is willing, powerless to resist.
###Chapter 141

After every failure, my dad and I would analyze what went wrong.

We would find an even more secluded spot.

But the outcome was always the same.

Mom was like a human tracking device.

No matter how well-hidden the place, she always…”

Sophia Sullivan trailed off.

She realized the man hadn't spoken for a while.

"Professor, are you listening?"

She turned her head.

Her gaze collided with his deep, intense eyes.

Sophia froze.

Her hair now fell past her shoulders.

Her hair tie had been loose during dinner.

The night breeze swept through.

Tendrils of hair danced wildly around her face.

For a fleeting moment, she looked unexpectedly captivating.

"Mhm, I'm listening." His voice was slightly hoarse.

"Your mother is very clever."

"She also has a sharp eye."

Sophia averted her gaze.

Her throat felt dry.

She swallowed hard.

After a long pause, she continued, "Of course she is! She writes mystery novels!"

Mystery novels prioritize logical deduction.

David Sullivan taught her morals and integrity.

Isabella Sullivan shaped the very foundation of her life.

She allowed Sophia to grow freely into the person she wanted to be.

"Professor, what about your childhood?"

Alexander Laurent: "Reading, studying, exams."

"...That's it?"

"Perhaps there was more, but I don't remember clearly."

Perhaps the streetlights were too gentle.

Perhaps Sophia's eyes were too bright.

Alexander looked towards the neon lights across the river.

He suddenly felt a desire to confide.

"The year I turned five."

"I found a book in my grandfather's study."

"‘The Way Things Work’."

"It was my first encounter with physics."

The man smiled faintly.

His gaze was sincere and fervent.

"Chuang Tzu said: ‘Appreciate the beauty of the universe. Probe into the laws of nature.’"

"The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible."

Sophia listened intently.

She didn't understand physics.

But she could empathize with his passion.

"Before I discovered physics, my world was dull and monotonous."

His voice paused.

He turned to look at Sophia.

"After discovering physics, this world finally held meaning."

And now.

It seemed there was one more person.

The man's gaze was intense.

His eyes burned.

Sophia was the first to look away.

Her unfinished ice cream was melting.

A cold drop fell on the back of her hand.

She stood up flustered. "It's getting late. We should head back."

The girl turned sideways.

Alexander couldn't see her expression clearly.

But he could sense her emotional turmoil.

He felt he had been somewhat unusual today...

"Alright, let's go."

…

That night, Sophia suffered from rare insomnia.

She lay with her eyes closed.

Her consciousness drifted between sleep and wakefulness.

Alexander Laurent's face flashed through her mind.

Then, memories of her past with Ethan Roscente surfaced.

She recalled the foolish things she had done for that man.

The foolish words she had said.

She jolted awake!

Hadn't she endured enough pain from love?

Since she had already freed herself, why consider entering another game?

It would just be jumping from the frying pan into the fire.

It was unnecessary.

It wasn't worth it.

Having clarified this.

Her anxious heart quickly calmed.

Since she couldn't sleep anyway.

She simply got up to revise her thesis.

Mhm, studying was still happier.

…

The next day at the lab.

Sophia had just swiped her card to enter.

She met the burning gazes of Zoe Langley and Quincy Evans.

"??" What was going on?
She paused mid-step.

"Dr. Langley, Professor Evans, why are you looking at me like that?"
"Is there a problem?"

Zoe and Quincy had been waiting for this!
"Sophia, can we discuss something?"
"What is it?"

Zoe: "I have two sets of data."
"The scale is massive."
"Organizing it is difficult, let alone calculating it."
"You're great at programming. Can you help us figure out a solution?"

Quincy quickly added: "None of us know how to program."
"We can only use traditional speed-calculation methods."
"This time the quantity is too large."
"The human brain is no match for a computer."
"Could you write a program for us?"
"Preferably one that can process the data in batches."

Half an hour later—
"Dr. Langley, take a look."
"How's this calculation chain and processing speed?"
"Does it need adjustment?"

Sophia moved aside.
Zoe sat down and checked the mouse.
Calculations that originally required five days.
At this speed, they could be completed in one day!

"Amazing!"
"Thank you, Sophia!"
"Love you! Love you! Love you to bits!"
Zoe hadn't held out much hope.
But! But!

Sophia waved her hand. "Don't mention it. It was nothing."
Quincy hurriedly crowded in.
"Let me try…"

Alexander Laurent came to the lab as usual after his class.
As soon as he entered, he saw Sophia sitting uncomfortably in a chair.
To be precise, she was being pressed into the chair!

Zoe Langley and Quincy Evans.
One was massaging her shoulders.
The other was handing her a freshly bought bubble tea.

Zoe: "You've worked hard, Sophia."
"Let me pound your shoulders for you."
"Even my husband doesn't get this treatment…"

Quincy: "Have some bubble tea, sweetie."
"Low sugar, no ice. Guaranteed healthy!"

Alexander Laurent: "?"
Since when had his team become Sophia's lackeys?!

Just then.
Lillian Lopez pushed the door open.
Seeing Zoe and Quincy hovering around Sophia with attentive expressions.
She couldn't help but curl her lip.

Simon Lowell was two steps behind.
Chasing after her with breakfast.
"Lillian, I bought your favorite soup dumplings and chicken congee."
"They're still hot. Eat them while they're warm?"

Lillian's expression was sour.
"Who eats greasy soup dumplings first thing in the morning?"
"So oily."
"Who told you I like chicken congee?"

Simon scratched his head.
"Didn't you say that place's chicken congee was good last time?"
"I thought you liked it."
"Last time was last time. I don't like it now."
"Oh. Then I'll buy something else next time."

Simon quickly went along with her words.
He could sense Lillian was in a bad mood.
She was throwing a tantrum.
And it was directed at him.

He didn't know what he had done wrong.
He just thought it was normal for a wealthy young lady to have a big temper.
He would just indulge her.

…

After Isabella Langley dropped out.
She focused entirely on the prenatal classes arranged by Victoria Roscente.
But this wasn't enough.
Victoria saw she had free time.
She simply filled all her leisure hours.

Like the upcoming clothing coordination class.
The class was held at a mall.
The instructor was supposedly a famous designer.

Isabella was initially interested.
But after fifteen minutes.
She was bored to tears, yawning repeatedly.

Another teacher might have pretended not to see.
The tuition was already paid.
How much the student learned was their own business.

But this teacher was different.
She particularly disliked inattentive students like Isabella.
Seeing her head nodding, about to doze off.
Her gaze turned severe.
###Chapter 142

The professor called on her directly.

Isabella Langley was drowsy.

She couldn't answer the question.

Students around her cast mocking glances.

She frowned in irritation.

She loved luxury goods.

But she only enjoyed owning them.

She hated studying how to style them.

The color theory lecture gave her a headache.

The moment the bell rang.

She was the first one out of the classroom.

A high-end mall was right next door.

Ethan Roscente hadn't reacted to her using his card before.

Isabella walked straight into a luxury boutique.

She shopped frantically.

Ethan was in a meeting.

His phone kept vibrating.

Purchase notifications came one after another.

He turned it off without expression.

Victoria Roscente arrived to pick her up on time.

The driver stopped at the mall entrance.

She got out and walked toward the classroom.

She didn't want to be here.

She missed her leisurely days of tea and cards with the ladies.

Now she was babysitting Isabella all day.

Like a nanny.

But she had to keep an eye on her.

She was afraid she'd harm the fetus.

Sometimes she regretted saving this pregnancy.

Whatever.

She'd deal with her after the baby was born.

The classroom was empty.

The professor told her the truth.

Isabella had given her the wrong schedule.

Class had ended long ago.

Victoria was furious.

Her calls went unanswered.

She stormed out of the classroom.

She ran into Isabella carrying countless shopping bags.

Her hands were full of Chanel and Hermès.

Victoria herself rarely splurged like this.

She rushed forward, snatched the bags, and threw them on the ground.

"Who do you think you are!"

"How dare you spend my son's money like this!"

"Do you think he's an ATM?"

"Are you even worth it?"

Her shouting drew a crowd.

Someone started recording.

Victoria completely lost control.

Isabella's face darkened.

She'd had enough.

"What's the big deal about a few bags?"

"The class is boring as hell."

"It's a miracle I even show up."

"Your son doesn't say anything."

"Why do you care?"

Victoria thought of Sophia Sullivan.

She never asked for luxury items.

She dressed simply but elegantly.

So much better than Isabella.

The words slipped out.

Isabella sneered.

"You like her that much?"

"Then go get her back."

"You and your son are pathetic."

"You didn't want her when she was here."

"Now you miss her after she's gone."

"That's just sad."

"I'm not Sophia Sullivan."

"I won't let you push me around."

"I'm not afraid to burn it all down."

"Don't expect me to go to class anymore."

"You go yourself!"

She picked up her bags and walked away.

Victoria's blood pressure spiked.

She yelled at the onlookers.

"Stop recording!"

"I'll call the police!"

The crowd dispersed.

Her chest ached with anger.

This is a curse.

A real curse.

Victoria was hospitalized that night.

Amelia Roscente rushed over.

Her mother looked pale in the hospital bed.

The doctor said her dizziness had returned due to emotional stress.

She needed rest.

Amelia saw the doctor out.

She took a bite of an apple and looked at her mother.

"Isabella put you in the hospital?"

"I told you that woman is trouble."

"What are you even getting out of this?"
###Chapter 143

Victoria Roscente ripped the towel from her forehead.

She glared at Amelia Roscente.

"Are you here to visit me or to provoke me? If she weren't carrying the Roscente heir, would I even give her a second glance?"

Amelia let out a derisive snort.

"Serves you right. That kind of woman is clearly scheming, trying to use her pregnancy to climb the social ladder. Only you would see her as some innocent, pure little flower."

She had never thought much of Isabella Langley from the start.

It was ridiculous that Victoria was only realizing it now.

Ethan Roscente rushed to the hospital from his office upon hearing his mother was admitted.

He heard the arguing before he even entered the room.

Frowning, he pushed the door open.

"What's all this noise?"

Seeing her son, Victoria immediately sat up straighter.

Her complaints vanished, replaced by direct accusation.

"Perfect timing! Your girlfriend is utterly out of control! I went to pick her up from class out of kindness, and she gave me the wrong schedule. She even talked back to me in public!"

"She humiliated me in front of everyone! You know I have vertigo. Her behavior triggered a full-blown episode!"

Amelia gave a light, mocking hum.

"Mom, don't say that. Isabella was my brother's careful choice. If you complain about her now and their relationship thrives later, who knows how she might resent you."

Her tone was dripping with sarcasm, completely ignoring Ethan's darkening expression.

Why couldn't he have just stayed with Sophia Sullivan?

Letting Sophia go for someone like Isabella.

It even cost Sophia her chance at Professor Eleanor Watson's graduate program.

Amelia still couldn't swallow that anger!

Ethan remained silent, his expression growing stormier.

He ignored both his mother's complaints and his sister's barbs.

He first went to the doctor's office to confirm Victoria's condition wasn't serious.

Then he left the hospital with a cold face.

Returning to the Beverly Hills mansion, he had barely opened the door when a soft, warm body threw itself into his arms.

It was Isabella.

She wore a silk slip nightgown. The black fabric made her skin appear snow-white.

The open neckline revealed delicate collarbones.

If Ethan looked down, he would see the hint of curves.

"Ethan, you're back—"

Her sweet, cloying voice was cut off as the man shoved her away roughly.

Ethan brushed off his sleeve with an expressionless face.

As if he had touched something filthy.

"Ethan…"

Slap!

Ethan backhanded her across the face.

Isabella's ears rang. She covered her cheek in disbelief.

"Who gave you the right to talk back to my mother?"

Tears instantly welled in Isabella's eyes.

"I just said a few extra words! Did she complain to you? Why can't you hear my side first? I'm a person too, I have my own thoughts! I just didn't want to go to class, what's so wrong about that?"

Ethan laughed coldly.

"Wasn't all of this what you begged for?"

His words shattered the last shred of Isabella's dignity.

He had told her to get an abortion, take the money, and leave. She refused and immediately went to Victoria.

"So what are you complaining about? You enjoy my mother's protection, then you provoke her until she lands in the hospital. Do you know what that makes you?"

Ethan enunciated each word, cruel and merciless.

"A hypocrite. A whore."

"I'm not! Why are you saying that to me too? I just love you so much! I want to have our baby, to stay by your side!"

Isabella wept profusely, not forgetting her passionate declaration.

Unfortunately, Ethan wasn't buying any of it.

"You're talking to me about love? Why do you think I'm keeping you? If it weren't for my mother, you wouldn't even be qualified to stand here."

The grievances Isabella had suppressed for days finally erupted.

"Can't you see everything I've done for us lately? I just want things to go back to how they were before! But your heart is made of stone, you won't give me any chance at all… Why? Is it because you still have feelings for Sophia Sullivan?! You can't forget her!"

The man spoke, word by deliberate word.

"What if I am?"

He couldn't even be bothered to pretend.

"I know I can't compare to Sophia Sullivan, but my love for you is no less than hers—"

Isabella cried pitifully, reaching out to grasp Ethan's hand.

He shook her off without mercy.

"You don't get to mention her." A vein throbbed at Ethan's temple, as if he was pushed to his limit. "Her name coming from your mouth is an insult."

"You have one day. Apologize to my mother yourself, or get out of this house. Your choice."

With that, he picked up his jacket and turned to leave.

Isabella trembled all over.

In his eyes, she couldn't see herself. She only saw a plaything, something that could be discarded at any moment.

She had gotten pregnant out of wedlock for him, given up her studies, endured humiliation and bowed and scraped before Victoria.

And the result?

He despised her. He wanted her gone?!

Isabella seethed with hatred.

She had sacrificed so much, struggled to get to this point, with wealth and luxury almost within her grasp.

How could she give up now?

Thinking of this, she wiped away her tears and protectively cradled her abdomen.

As long as the baby was still there, she hadn't lost.

…

Sitting in his car, Ethan didn't know where to go.

The hospital had a medical team. Victoria would receive the best care.

The mansion had Isabella. He didn't want to spend another second there.

The office…

He had already pulled two all-nighters. Even if he didn't need rest, his secretary and assistants did.

"Charlie, let's get a drink."

"Ethan, you've been organizing these outings a lot lately."

When he was with Sophia Sullivan, they met up two or three times a month at most.

Now he was like a runaway horse, completely without restraint.

Ethan: "Are you coming out or not?"

"Sorry, Ethan," Charlie Lowell's tone was apologetic. "I'm back at the family estate tonight."

"Alright. Send my regards to your parents."

He hung up and called Julian Winston.

That line didn't even connect.

At this hour, he was probably curled up with some woman.

Ethan scrolled through his contacts. His gaze suddenly stopped.

It landed on three words—

Sebastian Evans.

"Well, well, did the sun rise from the west today? You actually called me?" The other end picked up quickly, the words laced with sarcasm.

Sebastian always knew how to provoke people.

Surprisingly, Ethan didn't get angry. He held his cigarette out the window, flicking the ash.

He spoke lightly.

"I didn't expect the number to still work either."

Sebastian: "Blocking people is childish. I'm above that."

Ethan: "Want to get a drink?"

"You're not just using some excuse to get me out so you can pick a fight, are you?"

Ethan: "That's not off the table."

Sebastian gave a soft hum. "Send me the address."

…

Nightfall Bar.

Ethan arrived first and got a booth in the main area.

His drink had just arrived, not yet touched, when Sebastian showed up.

He sat directly across from Ethan, glanced at the bottles on the table, and raised an eyebrow.

"Tequila? Isn't that a bit strong?"

Ethan smirked.

"What? Scared?"
###Chapter 144

Sebastian Evans spread his hands, admitting candidly, "I've been focusing on self-cultivation lately. I really shouldn't drink."

Ethan Roscente felt his punch land on cotton, all its force dissipated.

His chest felt tight and uncomfortable.

"Sebastian Evans, is that all the guts you have? Are you even a man?"

"Drinking has nothing to do with guts. Whether I'm a man or not is obvious to anyone with eyes."

Ethan sneered coldly. "Do you reason with Sophia Sullivan like this when you pursue her?"

"No," Sebastian raised an index finger and gently shook it. "She understands reason. There's no need to explain it to her."

"Then what do you talk about?"

"Experiences. Interesting anecdotes. Professional knowledge. Poetry and literature. Even philosophy of life. And sweet nothings. There's too much to talk about. I can't list it all right now."

Ethan felt a lump in his throat.

Sebastian added fuel to the fire. "Want to hear? I can give you a special lecture another day?"

"..."

Unable to gain the upper hand verbally, Ethan could only drown his sorrows in drink.

Two shots of tequila later, he was slightly tipsy. He loosened his tie and unbuttoned his top two buttons.

Sebastian frowned. "Is your stomach condition better?"

"...No."

"With Sophia gone, no one is around to care for you, so you're just letting yourself go completely?"

Mentioning Sophia made Ethan's eyes sting.

He refused to acknowledge it was emotion. He blamed it on the alcohol.

Suddenly, he said in a low voice, "Twelve boxes."

"...What?"

His head was bowed. Sebastian couldn't see his expression. "After she left, I took twelve boxes of stomach medicine."

Sebastian's eyes darkened. "Trying to die? You think torturing yourself will make her soften and come back?"

"Why wouldn't it?!" Ethan's head snapped up, his eyes bloodshot.

"Thinking that proves you don't understand Sophia Sullivan at all." Sebastian signaled a waiter. "Take the alcohol away. Bring two teas."

The waiter was stunned. "Sir, our bar doesn't serve tea..."

Sebastian's gaze turned cold. "Then two glasses of plain water. Do you have that?"

"Yes, yes, right away."

The waiter quickly removed the alcohol and brought two glasses of warm water.

Ethan gave a twisted smile. "I don't understand her? I was with her for six years! Six years!"

"No need to shout. I'm well aware how long you were together. Not understanding her after six years only proves your negligence and failure."

"To put it bluntly, you didn't love her enough."

"Bullshit—" Ethan shot to his feet. "I loved her more than anyone!"

Sebastian looked up, his gaze calm. "If you loved her, why did you break up?"

"..."

"See? Every sentence contradicts itself. Every action digs your own grave. Love isn't about who shouts the loudest. Those six years are just the time you took to lose her."

The fig leaf was torn away, revealing the bloody truth.

It was cruel as a knife.

Sebastian: "You kept saying you loved her, but everything you did trampled on her."

"You trampled her will, her dignity, even her body."

"So a girl like Sophia Sullivan, no matter how much she loved, would leave. It was only a matter of time."

Six years...

Sebastian thought it was far too long.

So long he thought that dazzling girl had truly become a love-crazed marionette.

So long he once doubted and nearly gave up.

Fortunately, she finally took that step and became herself again.

Sebastian: "Six years. She gave you countless chances. Such blatant favoritism..." It was truly enviable!

"Unfortunately, you let her down. So she left decisively, leaving no way back."

This was the real Sophia Sullivan!

When in love, she charged forward fearlessly, betting everything.

When love was gone, she withdrew gracefully, walking her own path alone.

Before, Julian Winston called her "love-struck" and "sick." Now he blames her for being "too ruthless" and "too heartless."

But Sebastian knew Sophia never lived by others' judgments.

Love deeply.

Or leave cleanly.

"The moment she decided to leave, your stomach, your well-being... none of it concerned her anymore."

Ethan swayed slightly and slumped back into his seat.

He opened his mouth. The aggression was gone from his voice. "How much do you think... you understand her?"

Sebastian smiled.

"Women are like books. Who dares claim to have read them thoroughly? Different ages, different circumstances reveal different things."

"I don't need to understand Sophia Sullivan completely in a short time. I only ask to hold her in my hands for this lifetime, day and night as my companion, finding something new with each reading."

"So, to your question, my answer is: I don't understand her much. But you? You don't understand her at all!"

Stung, Ethan grabbed his glass and gulped its contents.

But it was only bland water.

The alcohol had long been taken away.

"Can't win the argument, and now you won't even let me drink?" He smiled bitterly.

Sebastian's expression was blank. "For old times' sake, a word of advice: a little drink pleasures the mood, heavy drinking harms the body. You only have one life. Don't joke with it."

Ethan paused, then tilted his head back and drank the water.

"Sebastian Evans, I shouldn't have asked you out for drinks. This is pointless."

"Yeah," Sebastian sighed, his hand reaching for a cigarette but then putting it down. "I'm not drinking anyway."

Ethan scoffed. "Gave up drinking, fine. Quit smoking too?"

"Trying to. Haven't succeeded yet."

Ethan was stunned. A decades-long chain smoker suddenly quitting?

"Why?"

Sebastian gave a light laugh, his eyes holding mockery and pity.

"I told you you don't understand Sophia, but you wouldn't believe it. She has allergic rhinitis. She's sensitive to smoke. It's not severe, but she always frowns whenever someone lights up."

Ethan was speechless.

Sebastian stood up and patted his shoulder. "Give up early. You won't get her back."

With that, he picked up his jacket and strode away.

"I paid the bill. Don't invite me next time. We're rivals in love now. Not suitable for chatting."
###Chapter 145: A Slap Is What You Deserve

Ethan Roscente left the bar and returned to his Beverly Hills mansion.

Isabella Langley was sitting on the living room sofa. Hearing the door open, she immediately rose to greet him.

Ethan ignored her completely, walking straight past her toward the staircase.

Isabella bit her lip, a flash of resentment in her eyes.

In the master bedroom, Ethan lay on the large bed.

This bed had witnessed his intimate moments with Sophia Sullivan. Those memories replayed in his mind, frame by frame.

His breathing grew heavy, a dark shadow clouding his eyes.

He cursed under his breath, got up, and stepped into the bathroom for a cold shower.

He had only had two drinks tonight. His mind was painfully clear.

Sebastian Evans's words echoed in his ears.

If you love her, why break up?

You just spent six years losing her...

You claim to love her, but everything you do tramples on her...

Even with the deepest love, leaving was inevitable...

Each word felt like a nail, driving hard into Ethan's heart.

...

Early the next morning, Ethan got up, dressed in a suit, and prepared to leave for the office.

Breakfast was already set on the table downstairs.

He assumed the housekeeper, Martha, had prepared it. Then he saw Isabella coming out of the kitchen, holding a plate of dumplings.

"Ethan, you're awake? I made congee and steamed some dumplings. Have some before you go?"

"No." Ethan's expression was blank.

Isabella set the plate down and moved closer. "Some soy milk then? I know you don't like it sweet, so I didn't add sugar."

Her tone was natural, her demeanor submissive, as if yesterday's argument had never happened.

Ethan's gaze swept over the table, then landed on her face. A faint, mocking smile touched his lips.

It was a smile full of self-mockery and disdain.

He suddenly realized that people truly couldn't be compared.

When he used to argue with Sophia, she was usually the first to yield, but she never wore such a fawning smile.

She would simply ask calmly—

Are you hungry?

Is your stomach okay?

Are we out of soy sauce?

If he responded, the cold war would end.

On matters of principle, even if she spoke first, it was never an apology. She would reason with him logically and clearly until she convinced him.

Ethan looked at the woman simpering before him, meeting her eyes that seemed clear but were full of calculation. Only two words came to mind—

Pathetic.

Oblivious to the disgust in his eyes, Isabella continued, "Ethan, I thought about it all night. Aunt Victoria is an elder. I shouldn't have talked back to her."

"It's all my fault."

"Signing me up for those classes was for me and the baby's own good. I was being ungrateful. I promise I'll listen to Auntie's arrangements from now on, respect her, be filial, and never make her angry again. Please forgive me?"

Ethan watched her perform, almost wanting to applaud.

"Apologizing to me is pointless. Go make amends to the person you offended."

He turned and left without another word.

He didn't touch a single bite of breakfast.

Isabella watched his retreating back, her smile vanishing instantly.

The thought of going to the hospital to face Victoria Roscente's scornful expression and apologize made her irritable.

But Ethan had issued an ultimatum. The consequences of not going were unthinkable.

Isabella took a deep breath and walked back into the kitchen.

Fortunately, she had asked Martha to prepare chicken soup last night. She could just take a random bowl to fulfill the obligation.

Martha asked, "Miss Langley, the soup isn't fully simmered yet. What are you—"

"Just do as you're told. Stop with the nonsense!"

Who cared if it was ready? Victoria probably wouldn't drink it anyway.

If she did, even better. Maybe she'd get diarrhea!

At the hospital room.

Isabella pushed the door open without knocking.

"Auntie, I brought you some chicken soup."

The sight of her made Victoria's recently subsided headache return. "Who told you to come? I don't want to see you. Get out—"

Isabella put on a sincere expression. "Auntie, I came to apologize. I was wrong yesterday. I shouldn't have talked back. This is fresh chicken soup I made this morning. It's very nourishing."

Victoria sneered. "An apology? This is a wolf offering condolences to a lamb! I'd be thankful if you just stopped angering me. How dare you offer me your soup?"

She was afraid it contained spit!

Isabella kept her smile, silently cursing: I hope it kills you, you old hag!

Her hands kept moving. She unscrewed the thermos lid, took out a bowl, poured the soup, and presented it with both hands. "Auntie, you've wronged me. I'm sincerely apologizing. The soup simmered for two hours. It's very tonic. Please have some—"

Before she could finish, Victoria swatted the bowl away.

She then grabbed a pillow and threw it at Isabella. "Get out! Who wants your soup? Who knows if it's poisoned! Get out of here—"

Isabella was driven out of the room.

She dodged quickly, but her skirt was still splattered with soup.

It was a white Dior dress, the new summer collection. The stain was obvious. She tried wiping it with a tissue, but it didn't come off. She gave up.

Her closet was full of designer clothes anyway. Some still had the tags on. She could just change.

After taking a few steps, Isabella suddenly remembered something. She took out her phone and opened WeChat to message Ethan. Finding she was already blocked, her face darkened. She switched to SMS and sent a photo of the soup she had taken at home earlier.

[Ethan, I've visited Auntie and apologized sincerely. I'm sorry.]

As expected, there was no response.

She didn't care, putting her phone away and preparing to leave.

Just as she was about to get into the car, a cold female voice called out. "Isabella Langley?"

She turned around. It was Amelia Roscente.

Her future sister-in-law!

Isabella immediately put on a bright smile and stepped forward. "Amel—"

Slap!

Without a word, Amelia slapped her across the face.

Isabella was stunned.

Amelia withdrew her hand, her chin lifted slightly. "This slap is to teach you about respect and knowing your place! Who do you think you are? Even my brother doesn't dare talk back to our mother, and you had the nerve to make her so angry she ended up in the hospital?"

Isabella held her stinging cheek, her smile frozen. "How... how could you hit me?"

"I'm hitting a low-class bitch like you! Don't think getting pregnant lets you do whatever you want. You'd better pray my mother is okay, or you'll regret it deeply."

Amelia brushed past her without a second glance.

A young lady of her status wouldn't deign to look at an ant like Isabella.

Back then, even Sophia Sullivan received her polite greetings. Now, Isabella Langley only deserved a slap.

Amelia couldn't help but complain internally—

Her brother's taste was truly cursed. He gave up Sophia for this?

###Chapter 146

The lab remained busy even in June.

Sophia Sullivan had worked for two consecutive weeks.

She finally had a day off.

She woke up early that morning.

She fed the goldfish in the tank.

Her phone suddenly rang.

It was a call from her father, David Sullivan.

"Are you up, sweetie?"

"Yes, just got up."

"Why not sleep more? Isn't today your day off?"

"My body clock is set. Where's Mom?"

"In the study."

"Writing again?"

"Yes, her inspiration is strongest in the morning."

Sophia remembered the copyright contract.

Her expression darkened slightly.

"Dad, has Mom's editor contacted her recently?"

"No, why? They usually communicate online."

"Nothing, just asking."

After hanging up.

Sophia went to the kitchen to prepare breakfast.

David went to the backyard to tend his plants.

Isabella Sullivan sat at her computer in the study.

She typed intently.

Words flowed from her fingertips.

Weaving into thrilling tales.

Everything was peaceful and perfect.

Unaware that near the faculty housing complex.

Outside their old home.

A woman in a Chanel suit was pounding on the door.

"Isabella! Are you home?"

Editor Moore carried a brown Delvaux handbag.

Her high heels sank into the dirt.

Her face was full of impatience.

What a dump!

Worse than a doghouse!

If Isabella's contract wasn't about to expire.

She wouldn't have come personally.

They could have renewed online.

But after their last argument.

Isabella had blocked all her contacts.

Editor Moore scoffed.

They'd had plenty of fights over the years.

Isabella always caved first.

Asking her to write web novels this time.

Probably crossed a line.

That's why it was taking so long.

But Editor Moore was confident.

Isabella would eventually give in.

It was only a matter of time.

"Isabella! I know you're in there!"

"Open the door!"

"This is ridiculous! A guest came all this way!"

"Work disagreements are one thing!"

"Have you no basic manners?"

"Isabella! Keep this up and I'll drop your books!"

Editor Moore grew more frantic.

She started slamming the door.

Her hands turned red.

There was still no response from inside.

"Who's making all that noise so early? Death calling?"

A woman in pajamas rushed out next door.

Her hair was a mess.

Her face full of sleep-induced anger.

She stood hands on hips in her yard.

Glaring at Editor Moore through the iron railings.

"Who are you staring at? I'm talking to you!"

"Making a racket this early! Can't you let people sleep?"

"Dressed all fancy but no sense of decency!"

Editor Moore hadn't been yelled at like this in years.

She was momentarily stunned.

The woman continued her tirade.

"Trash attracts flies!"

"One after another, so damn annoying!"

"Watch your mouth!"

Editor Moore snapped back to reality.

"All that cursing! Hope your tongue rots!"

"You're the one bringing bad news! On your whole family!"

Linda Moore hated being cursed at.

She flew into a rage.

"You old hag! You bitch! Who are you calling 'big sister'?"

"Your big sister works at a brothel, doesn't she?"

Her scornful eyes raked over Editor Moore from head to toe.

"Hah! Dressed like no decent woman!"

"All flashy! How many men did you service last night?"

Editor Moore was shocked.

She hadn't expected such filthy language.

It was all personal attacks.

"You—you—" She trembled with anger.

Even if she wanted to retaliate.

She couldn't bring herself to say such things.

"Me, me, me, what about me?"

"Tongue tied? Can't form words?"

"Should give a discount for overnight? Fifty? Seventy?"

"Are you even worth a hundred?"

Editor Moore's face flushed red.

"I won't reason with a shrew like you!"

"Absolutely ridiculous! Unreasonable! Disgusting!"

"Ooh! Using big words? I can too!"

"Floozy! Shameless! Whore! Slut!"

Editor Moore was speechless.

"I won't stoop to your level! It's beneath me!"

"Someone like you only deserves to be compared to pigs and dogs!"

She turned to leave.

"Hah— Pigs and dogs are better than a slut like you!"

Editor Moore stumbled.

Her high heel sank into a mud puddle.

Ruining her thousand-dollar shoes.

Her mood worsened.

What a terrible neighborhood Isabella lived in.

With such awful neighbors.

Today was truly cursed.

The contract expired in half a month.

Isabella wouldn't dare not renew.

The publishing industry had undergone major changes.

Physical book sales were struggling.

Isabella's fame had long faded.

She'd been offline for years.

She had no publishing connections.

Besides her.

Who would still want to be her editor?

Help her publish books?

This trip was completely unnecessary.

Once the contract expired.

Isabella would come begging to renew.

The more Editor Moore thought, the more she felt coming today was a mistake.

Not only was she ignored.

But also cursed at by a madwoman.

Hmph! She'd blame this on Isabella!

When she came begging.

She'd make her grovel.

Just to vent today's anger!

"Mrs. Moore, arguing again?"

A passing neighbor joked.

"Didn't the Sullivan family move away?"

"Hmph! Some random trashy relative!"

"Pounding on the door so early! Woke me up!"

"The Sullivans' relative? Shouldn't they be at the villa?"

"Why come here?"

Linda Moore rolled her eyes.

"Who knows?"

"Speaking of which, have you been to the Sullivans' villa?"

"Wow! So impressive! Multiple floors with two gardens!"

"We visited the other day! The flowers were gorgeous!"

"The vegetables in the garden were so green…"

Linda Moore's expression grew uglier the more she listened.

"I'm going back to sleep."

She made an excuse and returned inside.

After some thought, she dug out a business card.

Hesitated, then dialed the number.

"Hello, Mr. Semona!"

"You said you could help me sell my house for a better one?"

"How does it work exactly?"

His eyes lit up on the other end.

"Auntie, let me explain! We can do it like this…"

He had just received insider information.

The faculty housing complex was slated for demolition.

The compensation policy was quite generous.
###Chapter 147
Just a Little?

Sophia Sullivan finished clearing the breakfast dishes and began cleaning.

The apartment had gathered a thin layer of dust after being unoccupied for half a month.

She spent the entire morning cleaning before it was spotless.

After her nap, she changed clothes and prepared to go grocery shopping.
Olivia Lopez's call came through suddenly.

"Mimi, are you home?"

"Yes, what's wrong?"

"I suddenly crave your cooking."

Sophia detected the low spirits in her voice.

"Did something happen?"

"No... I just miss you." The voice on the other end sounded muffled.

Sophia didn't press further. "Come over. I'll cook for you."

"Great! I'll be there in forty minutes!"

Sophia hurried out to shop.
She had just returned home when Olivia arrived.

Olivia hugged her tightly the moment she stepped inside. "You're the best. You bought all my favorites."

Sophia heard the grievance in her words and guessed it was related to Aunt Bai.

"Go sit down first. Dinner will be ready soon."

"Okay!" Olivia nodded obediently.

Fifty minutes later, the meal was on the table.
Every dish was tailored to Olivia's tastes.

"Mimi, do you have any alcohol? I feel like drinking."

"There's beer in the fridge."

"Yes, please!"

Olivia had the next day off.
Sophia also had two consecutive days off.

They didn't eat much, but the alcohol disappeared quickly.

Beer isn't very strong, but she kept drinking one can after another.

Eventually, Olivia's cheeks flushed red, and her gaze grew hazy.

As dusk fell, she showed no signs of stopping.

"Where's the alcohol? I'll grab two more bottles—"

Olivia suddenly stood up, swaying unsteadily toward the refrigerator.

She nearly stumbled after just two steps.
Sophia quickly steadied her.

"Be careful!"

Olivia pouted. "I'm not drunk! I just tripped!"

Sophia muttered under her breath, "Drunk people never admit they're drunk…"

Olivia's hearing was sharp. "Don't believe me? I can drink a few more bottles!"

"...There's no more alcohol at home."

"Then let's go buy some!"

Sophia was stunned.

Olivia picked up her jacket and was about to head out.

Suddenly, she paused. "No, I can't drink and drive. I need to find someone to drive."

She took out her phone and fumbled several times before finally dialing.

"Hello? I'm at the original steel mill dormitory on College Road. Come pick me up. I need to buy alcohol!"

There was a two-second silence on the other end. "...Where are you?"

Olivia found the voice familiar but couldn't place it.

"Open the door now."

Olivia frowned. "Why should I listen to you?"

"..."

Sophia hadn't expected her to actually call someone.

A knock sounded at the door.

She opened it to find Alexander Laurent standing there, phone still pressed to his ear.

Sophia fell silent.

Did Olivia do this on purpose?

Why did she have to call Alexander Laurent?

Anyone else wouldn't have arrived this quickly!

Ten minutes later.

Sophia settled Olivia into bed and gently closed the door.

Turning around, she saw Alexander sitting in the living room.
His gaze was fixed on the empty beer bottles.

"..."

"Did she drink all of this?" The man's voice was calm but carried an underlying pressure.

"I had a little too."

"Just a little?" Alexander looked directly at her.

Sophia gave up resisting. "Two bottles... I'm not drunk."

Olivia had been mixing drinks because she was upset, so she got heavily intoxicated.

Alexander rubbed his temples. "Sit still. I'll clean up."

Sophia's reaction was a beat slow.
By the time she processed his words, Alexander had already rolled up his sleeves and started cleaning.

She blinked in surprise, then obediently sat back on the sofa.

By the time everything was tidied, it was already nine in the evening.

"Wait a moment. I'm going to take out the trash."

Sophia stood up. "I'll come too. I want some fresh air."

"Put on a jacket."

"Okay."

The hallway light was dim.
Alexander walked ahead, with Sophia following behind.

His tall figure cast a long shadow.
She stepped on the shadow as she walked.

"Aunt called me this afternoon." Alexander spoke suddenly.

"About the blind date?"

Olivia had complained a few times before, so Sophia could guess.

Alexander hummed in agreement.

After disposing of the trash, they walked side by side under the streetlights.

"The Laurent family doesn't need arranged marriages.薇薇 understands this."

That's why she couldn't comprehend Nina White's pressure to marry.

But Nina White believed matching social status was an ancestral rule.

She herself had married into a prominent family through arrangement and was very satisfied.

Her husband was gentle and considerate, and their marriage was happy.

Because she had benefited from a well-matched marriage, she wanted the same for her daughter.

But Olivia was rebellious by nature.
After graduating, she had enjoyed years of freedom...

Sophia pressed her lips together.

"She had a big fight with Aunt. She won't return to the Laurent family for a while."

Alexander's voice remained calm. "Fortunately, she has you. I'll have to trouble you to look after her recently."

Sophia replied, "Professor, there's no need for formalities. Olivia is my friend."

She just hadn't expected...
###Chapter 148

Giving up on Sophia Sullivan was absolutely impossible.

This supposedly distant cousin Olivia Lopez mentioned, the one she wasn't close to, actually cared for her deeply.

Then again, Alexander Laurent's aloof exterior was just a facade.
Sophia knew he was simply too busy to express his concern verbally.
His heart was softer than anyone's.

"If anything like this happens again, contact me anytime."

He paused briefly, his gaze subtly shifting toward her.
"Alcohol stimulates the nerves. Mild cases cause nausea and vomiting, severe ones lead to shock or fainting. It's better to drink less. Don't you agree?"

"..."

Knowing he was hinting at her, Sophia's cheeks flushed, the tips of her ears turning pink.

She cleared her throat softly, defending herself.
"Despite its side effects, alcohol offers a brief escape from worries. An occasional release, a proper vent, can be a form of emotional catharsis. Don't you agree?"

Alexander didn't expect her to not only rebut but also mimic his questioning tone. He couldn't help but chuckle.

"There are many ways to vent. Must it be alcohol?"

"Ahem... It varies from person to person. What if someone enjoys it?"

Alexander stopped walking, suddenly turning to face her.
"Do you enjoy it?"

Sophia was slightly taken aback. Meeting his deep gaze, she instinctively looked away and shook her head.
"No, I don't."

Even when Ethan Roscente hurt her deeply in the past, she never drowned her sorrows in drink.
Avoidance solved nothing.
She feared even more the loss of control and rationality that came with drunkenness.

A slight smile touched Alexander's lips.
"No wonder my aunt was worried Olivia would be a bad influence on you."

Sophia: "?"

"If you ever feel like drinking, you can call me."

"To help clean up the mess?" She couldn't help laughing at that.

Alexander nodded, then shook his head.
"Besides that, I might even have a drink with you."

Sophia blinked.
"You? Have a drink with me?"

She couldn't picture Alexander Laurent drinking.

"You don't believe me?" The man raised an eyebrow.

"I don't," Sophia shook her head.

"You can verify it yourself when the opportunity arises."

"Okay."

His gaze was as gentle as water, capable of making one drown in the next second.

"Beep—"

A Mercedes sped past them, its harsh horn cutting through the budding ambiguity.

Sophia snapped back to reality, looking up at the sky.
"It looks like rain. Let's go home."

Without waiting for Alexander's response, she turned and walked away first.

Alexander stood still, watching the girl's retreating figure, a smile unconsciously gracing his lips.

Inside the Mercedes, Ethan watched the man and woman walking side-by-side in the rearview mirror, his grip on the steering wheel tightening repeatedly.
He didn't even notice his knuckles turning white.

Sophia had changed.
She smiled more than before, but those smiles were for another man.
It turned out, all this time, only he had remained stuck in place.
She had already found a new target, someone else by her side.
Whether it was Alexander Laurent or Sebastian Evans, neither was inferior to him!

Ethan didn't want to admit it, but the truth was, after Sophia left him, her life was far better than he had imagined.
The more he realized this, the more unsettled he felt.
Why?
Why could she break away so cleanly, leave so decisively, while he was trapped by memories, unable to break free?
In that moment, Ethan suddenly hated her.
He hated her ruthlessness, hated that she couldn't just give him one more chance, like she used to...

Early morning, heavy rain poured down.
Ethan drove back to the Beverly Hills mansion, parked the car, but didn't want to get out.
Looking at the house right in front of him, that place without Sophia, it could no longer be called a "home."
He took out a cigarette and lit it.
In the enclosed space, the smoke had nowhere to disperse.
The crimson ember burned between his fingers, white smoke rising, quickly blurring his features.
Ethan sank into the darkness, as if merging with the night.

The time it took to smoke one cigarette wasn't long, nor was it short.
The man's previously dazed eyes suddenly cleared as the cigarette burned out—
Giving up on Sophia Sullivan was absolutely impossible!
He had possessed her once, lost her now, but that didn't mean he couldn't have her again in the future.
As long as...
he could win her back, everything could return to how it was before.

Ethan pushed the car door open, threw away the cigarette butt, and walked towards the villa.
Isabella Langley stood at the entrance, a smiling face greeting him.
Ethan glanced at his watch. One o'clock in the morning. Hah...
"Ethan, I..."
Isabella had just begun to speak, not even finishing a complete sentence, when the man walked straight past her and inside.
As if she, a living person standing there, was no different from the air.
Isabella's smile froze instantly.
But quickly, she regained it.
"Ethan, I cooked a few dishes myself tonight. I called but you didn't answer, and my messages couldn't go through. You've blocked me..."
Ethan stopped walking and turned to look at her.
"Are you accusing me?"
"No, no... I just wanted to ask if you could unblock me? I was worried when I couldn't reach you." Isabella spoke carefully.
The man said nothing, not even bothering to voice a refusal.
She, however, acted as if she didn't notice, walking to the dining table and continuing on her own.
"I didn't know when you'd be back, so I could only wait... These dishes have been reheated four or five times. They're definitely inedible now..."
Ethan's eyes swept over the tabletop, and he instantly laughed.
Steamed shrimp, steamed egg with minced pork, stir-fried celery, pickled cabbage and vermicelli soup.
"What is it, Ethan?"
"Good effort. Next time, don't bother."
He was allergic to shrimp, and he didn't eat minced pork or celery either.
The pickled cabbage and vermicelli were neutral, but unfortunately, large slices of ginger floated on the soup's surface, utterly killing any appetite.
She certainly knew how to step on every landmine.

Watching the man's retreating back as he went upstairs, Isabella suppressed the urge to flip the table, took a deep breath—
"Martha!"
No response.
"Mrs. Moore—"
"...Yes, Miss Langley? What is it?"
Mrs. Moore didn't dare to play dumb like Martha did. After all, she hadn't watched the young master grow up.
Isabella instructed expressionlessly, "Clear the table."
"These dishes..."
"Throw them away."
"Okay."

In the master bedroom, Ethan lay on the bed. Seeing Isabella's spread of dishes, he couldn't help but think of Sophia again.
From never having lifted a finger to cook, to preparing meals for him with her own hands—no one had done it better than her.
No matter how late he came home, the food on the table was always warm.
Anything he was allergic to never appeared on the dining table.
There was always a balance of meat and vegetables, nutritionally paired—all things she had painstakingly figured out by studying cookbooks and nutrition guides.
The better he had eaten then, the greater the落差 felt now.

...

The next day, Ethan got up for work.
Isabella seemed incapable of understanding plain language and had prepared breakfast for him again.
Ethan walked straight past without a single glance at the table.
Surprisingly, Isabella wasn't angry either. She smiled and fetched a tie.
"What are you doing?" Ethan grabbed her wrist.
Ethan, let me help with your tie.
###Chapter 149

You're wearing the black shirt today.

Isabella Langley paused, her expression confused.

I know.

Ethan Roscente turned his face away.

They clearly weren't on the same wavelength.

A floral tie with a black shirt.

Only she would think of that combination.

He pushed her hand away.

If you can't do it properly, don't bother.

He turned and walked off without another word.

...

Late at night.

Ethan finished his work.

He slid into his car and lit a cigarette.

He sat in the hazy smoke, not starting the engine.

Only after stubbing out the cigarette did he finally drive away.

He didn't want to return to the Beverly Hills mansion.

The car drifted aimlessly.

He saw Victoria Roscente's call and hung up immediately.

Without realizing it, he found himself driving down that familiar alley.

Just as expected, he got yelled at again.

Think you're so great with your fancy car!

So many luxury cars in this alley lately.

There was a Porsche here just the other day.

...

Exactly eight o'clock.

Sophia Sullivan came downstairs to take out the trash.

Ethan watched her through the car window.

Her blue floral dress made her skin look snow-white.

Her long hair fell softly over her shoulders.

The flip-flops gave her a casual, carefree air.

He was about to get out of the car.

A figure blocked his path.

Alexander Laurent spoke calmly.

We meet again, Mr. Roscente.

Move.

Seeing Sophia about to go upstairs, Ethan's tone grew urgent.

Alexander didn't budge.

He watched her enter the building before turning back.

Do you have a habit of spying, Mr. Roscente?

None of your business—

Reporting unlawful activity is a civic duty.

...

Ethan suddenly let out a cold laugh.

Are you really doing this without any personal motive?

What does it matter if I have one or not?

Alexander met his gaze evenly.

What right do you have to a personal motive?

How long have I known her compared to you?

The length of time is irrelevant.

Some people never connect, even after a lifetime.

Others know with a single glance.

And you—

You had that glance, that eternity, and now you're strangers.

Every word was a precise, painful strike.

They pierced him, leaving him utterly exposed.

You think blocking me will get you anywhere with her?

Dream on.

The two things aren't necessarily connected.

I'm blocking you to keep her from being disturbed.

Sophia Sullivan doesn't belong to anyone.

She belongs only to herself.

Alexander turned to leave.

He tossed a final, light remark over his shoulder.

No wonder she broke up with you.

Ethan stood frozen on the spot.

The words hit their mark, sharp and deep.

A group of old men from the alley mouth charged toward him with sticks.

He had no choice but to drive away.

You free, Charlie?

Charlie Lowell answered immediately.

At the bar. Julian Winston's here too.

Send me the location.

The usual place. I'll be there in fifteen.

...

The bar music was deafening.

The private room door shut out the noise.

Ethan's here?

Julian Winston, arm around a curvy woman, greeted him.

Ethan sat down directly.

The woman tried to snuggle close, but he pushed her away.

Don't touch me.

The woman's smile froze as she looked at Julian.

If you're not satisfied, we can get another.

Not interested.

Julian raised an eyebrow.

You weren't like this before.

Shouldn't you be letting loose after splitting with Sophia?

Or is the pregnant one at home keeping you in line?

Ethan downed a glass of liquor.

He remained silent.

Julian called the woman back to his own side.

He held his own beauty and teased.

Why the long face when you're out having fun?

Who upset you?

No one.

Then give us a smile.

Get lost.

Julian laughed loudly.

When's your kid due?

I'm going to be an uncle.

You doing this on purpose?

Julian made a zipping motion over his mouth.

Charlie rolled his eyes.

Your schadenfreude is way too obvious.

Is it?

Julian played dumb.

Don't mind him, Ethan.

Charlie moved to pour more drinks.

Ethan covered his glass.

No need. One is enough.

Charlie was taken aback.

That's not like you.

Was I a heavy drinker before?

Of course.

Ethan thought of the past.

Every time he came home drunk, someone was always waiting.

Those worried eyes were something he'd never see again.

Ethan, your eyes are red.

The liquor's too strong.

Charlie looked puzzled.

But this brand is really smooth.

Julian smiled knowingly.

He pinched the woman beside him.

"Julian~"

The woman giggled and offered him a drink.

Feed me with this.

He tapped her lips.

Giggles filled the air.

Ethan grew increasingly irritable.

Even Charlie found it hard to watch.

Then his phone rang.

Hello? Sophia—
###Chapter 150
What's Your Problem?

Charlie picked up his phone.

He prepared to step out to take the call.

Ethan and Julian simultaneously pressed down on his shoulders.

Ethan signaled for everyone to be quiet.

Julian turned off the music.

Their movements were swift.

Their coordination was seamless.

Charlie swallowed hard.

He felt immense pressure.

Sophia had hesitated for a long time before making this call.

Isabella's contract was about to expire.

If they didn't renew with Editor Moore, they needed a new editor.

The new editor needed experience publishing suspense and thriller novels.

Preferably with promotional resources.

Among the people she knew, only Charlie had connections in media and publishing.

Sophia wasn't worried about Charlie refusing to help.

She knew if he had the resources, he would refer them.

Even though she and Ethan had broken up, her friendship with Charlie remained.

Her hesitation was about whether she should make this decision for Isabella.

She called home this morning.

David said Isabella had been bursting with inspiration lately.

She had been pulling all-nighters for a week.

Even digging and fertilizing in the backyard had to be done quietly.

They were afraid of disturbing her creative process.

Sophia gritted her teeth.

She decided to find someone for Isabella first.

Whether to accept would ultimately be Isabella's decision.

Besides, they might not even find anyone.

Sophia spoke softly.
"Charlie, are you busy right now?"

"Not at all, not at all."

"Even if I were busy, I'd take your call, Sophia!"

"Stop joking."

"I need a serious favor."

Charlie immediately sat up straight.
"Tell me."

"I'll move heaven and earth for you!"

Sophia briefly explained the situation.

Charlie listened attentively.

He nodded and hummed in agreement occasionally.

Ethan watched Charlie.

He suddenly felt strange.

Charlie's attitude toward Sophia.

It wasn't like how one treats a good friend's ex-girlfriend.

It was more like how one treats an equal friend.

Why?

Sophia only met Charlie through him.

How could they still stay in contact after breaking up?

Charlie kept calling her "Sophia."

It didn't sound insincere at all.

Charlie appeared smiling and easygoing on the surface.

But he was actually quite arrogant deep down.

His so-called friendliness was mostly an act.

Ethan's eyes turned sharp.

With Sebastian's precedent.

It was hard for him not to be suspicious.

Charlie scratched his head.
"Sophia, most of my investments are in new media and online short dramas."

"As for publishing…"

He suddenly looked at Julian.

Julian raised an eyebrow.
"Sophia, Julian invested in a publishing house."

"Top three in the domestic industry."

"They mainly publish textbooks and traditional fiction."

"It fits your requirements."

"Should I ask for you?"

Sophia was silent for a moment.

She didn't respond immediately.

Charlie didn't press her.
"Sophia, let me ask for you first."

"No guarantee it'll work out."

He understood Sophia didn't want to owe Julian a favor.

So he made the decision for her.

It was just asking.

"Get some rest soon, Sophia."

Charlie hung up the phone.

Julian couldn't help but smirk.
"Look at you, so eager."

"What did Sophia give you?"

"Calling her 'Sophia' so affectionately is nauseating."

Charlie glared at him.
"What do you know?"

"I'm all about sincerity with my friends."

"If you don't like it, don't look."

"Friends?" Julian raised an eyebrow.
"She broke up with Ethan."

"How did you two get so close?"

Ethan also looked at Charlie.

Charlie suddenly sat up straight.

His expression turned serious.
"You can't say that."

"Sophia helped me before."

"Her not being with Ethan anymore."

"Doesn't affect my friendship with her."

"Helped you?" Julian's eyes flickered.
"Helped you with what?"

Charlie cleared his throat lightly.
"It's a long story."

"Not today."

"Let's drink, let's drink."

"Oh, right, Julian, there's something—"

"I really need to use the restroom."

Julian bolted out faster than a rabbit.

Charlie was stunned.

He felt it was intentional.

Julian left the private room.

He didn't go to the restroom.

He walked to the terrace and lit a cigarette.

His brows were tightly furrowed.

He seemed troubled by something.

He paced back and forth occasionally.

Visibly agitated.

One cigarette burned out.

He lit another.

He took an occasional puff.

Most of the time, he just let it burn.

Suddenly, he crushed the cigarette butt.

As if he had made a decision.

He took out his phone and dialed.

After hanging up, Sophia placed her phone on the coffee table.

She went to take a shower.

After drying her hair.

She noticed two missed calls.

An unknown number with a D.C. area code.

She called back.

The other end picked up quickly.
"Hello, may I ask who's calling?"

Julian chuckled helplessly.
"Sophia, we've known each other for years."

"You didn't save my number?"

What was most infuriating was that she had saved Charlie's.

But not his!

Different treatment, huh?

Hearing Julian's voice.

Sophia was taken aback.
"Julian, you…"

"What's your problem?"

"You called so late just for this?"

Julian also found himself ridiculous.

The words had slipped out without thought.

Shit!

Why was he competing over this?

Sophia asked softly.
"What did you need?"

"I was there when you called Charlie."

"So?"

"Charlie already said I have the resources."

"I can help."

"Why didn't you call me?"

"I have tons of editor contacts!"

Sophia was silent.
"I didn't have your number."

"And Charlie said he'd ask you for me."

Julian was speechless.
"Sophia, do you know the most important thing about asking for a favor?"

"What?"

"Finding the right person!"

"You asked Charlie to ask me."

"There's a fundamental difference between that and you asking me directly."

"Understand?"

"Honestly, not really."

"So you called to remind me I should ask you directly?"

Julian lifted his chin slightly.
"Of course!"

"I don't like owing favors."

"You helped me before."

"I never repaid it."

Sophia was momentarily dazed.

She had almost forgotten if Julian hadn't reminded her.
###Chapter 151

Julian Winston flicked the ash from his cigarette.

I owe you one for that hotel incident.

I always pay my debts.

Even though you and Ethan are done, a debt is still a debt.

He stood in the corridor for over ten minutes.

Sophia Sullivan hadn't even considered contacting him directly.

Charlie Lowell clearly said the resources were with him.

Top-tier resources, at that.

Why was this woman so stubborn?

Julian let out a soft, derisive snort.

Looking for a reliable editor, right?

I'll refer one to you right now.

Sophia was never one for false pride.

If resources were handed to her on a silver platter, only a fool would refuse.

Thank you.

Repaying my debt.

The call ended.

Julian found the editor's WeChat.

He prepared to forward it to Sophia.

He paused abruptly.

He didn't have Sophia's WeChat.

He dialed her number again.

Add me on WeChat.

Don't worry, I'm not like Sebastian Evans.

I have no interest in my friend's ex.

If it makes you uncomfortable, you can delete me after I send the contact.

Request accepted.

Okay.

Contact card successfully forwarded.

Julian put away his phone and returned to the private room.

Charlie grinned mischievously.

Took you so long. Did you fall in?

Get lost.

A woman giggled and pressed herself against him.

Julian, why did you abandon me earlier?

Should I have taken you to the men's room? Julian lightly patted her cheek.

The woman pouted and shot him a playful glare.

Julian, book me for the night, please?

Julian looked her over with a wicked smile, saying nothing.

Her smile faded, unable to hide her disappointment.

These rich boys were generous, that was true.

But when it came to emotions, they were utterly heartless.

Cold as ice.

...

The party ended in the early hours.

The three men walked to the bar's entrance.

Julian raised an eyebrow.

How are you two getting back?

Ethan Roscente: Designated driver.

Charlie Lowell: Taxi. You?

Julian Winston: Staying at a hotel.

That's not like you. Going to a hotel without a woman?

If I wanted one, it's just a phone call away, isn't it?

Charlie's mouth twitched. Take it easy. Don't catch anything.

Don't worry, I know my limits. My ride's here. I'm off.

Wait. Charlie grabbed him. You said you'd refer an editor to Sophia...

Already did. Julian waved his hand impatiently.

When? How? Charlie was instantly alert.

Just now.

You aren't even contacts. How did you refer her?

We added each other just now.

Charlie narrowed his eyes. Since when are you so helpful? You're not turning into another Sebastian...

Stop! Julian cut him off, glancing sideways at Ethan.

Damn, his face was like thunder.

Helping Sophia is repaying a debt. Don't accuse me of that.

One Sebastian is more than enough.

There are plenty of women in the world. Why focus on a friend's?

Even an ex is off-limits.

Charlie relaxed. That's more like it...

Let go. I'm getting in the car.

Fine. Charlie released him.

Ethan spoke suddenly.

You helped her because of me?

Julian's hand on the car door stilled. He turned and smiled. Actually, no.

You... Ethan's gaze swept over Charlie, scrutinizing. You've been contacting her unilaterally since the breakup?

Charlie nodded openly. We talk often. Problem?

Julian's eyes narrowed. I know what you're asking.

You think whether we contact her or help her, it's because of you.

Let me be clear. It's because of Sophia herself. It has nothing to do with you. Same for Charlie.

Ethan frowned.

Why?

Julian snorted. Relationships are about reciprocity. Give and take, that's how connections are built.

You think Sophia was just your shadow for six years? We hung out two or three times a month. Plenty of chances to interact.

Take Charlie. Sophia fixed your computer, wrote programs for you, right?

Charlie nodded vigorously. Sophia's coding is amazing. That time my project investment nearly got messed with by finance, she wrote a program to untangle the mess.

And that other time...

Charlie went on and on.

Ethan grew more and more confused.

Was the Sophia they described the same woman he remembered? The one who stayed home waiting for him, arranging every little detail?

Charlie: And you, didn't Sophia help you too...

Ahem! Julian interrupted. That's enough. I'm leaving. You two head back.

He got into the taxi.

Driver, let's go.

...

Sophia received the contact Julian forwarded.

She sent a friend request.

It was accepted instantly.

An auto-reply popped up.

[Hello. If you are an author, please leave your submission and contact info. For business inquiries requiring immediate attention, please call 1372324...]

Sophia chose one of Isabella Sullivan's suspense novels from last year.

She sent the Word document and left her phone number.

It was late. There was no immediate response.

She didn't mind, expecting a reply in a couple of days.

The night was deep.

Ethan arrived home.

Isabella Langley was still standing at the door, smiling like a greeter.

He had to admire her persistence in this regard.

Isabella reached out to steady him.

Before she could touch him, she wrinkled her nose at the smell of alcohol.

Ethan called for Martha to help him upstairs.

He had only had two drinks today. He wasn't drunk at all.

But if he was drunk, Isabella wouldn't pester him with endless chatter.

So it was better to play drunk.

Martha helped him to the master bedroom and came down to make sobering soup.

Miss Langley, is there something you need? The kitchen isn't safe. Please wait in the living room. Martha's tone was cool.

Isabella's smile didn't falter. Martha, I heard you watched Ethan grow up?

You must have made him sobering soup often, then?

Martha: When Miss Sullivan was here, she handled it. The young master preferred hers.

...

While Martha's back was turned getting a bowl, Isabella quickly poured a packet of powder into the pot.
###Chapter 152
Martha turned around.

She immediately put on a bright smile. "I'll leave Ethan in your care, Martha. I'm a bit tired and will retire to my room now."

After speaking, she turned gracefully and left the kitchen.

Martha was stunned.

What was happening?

Didn't she always fight to deliver the hangover remedy before?

Why the sudden change?

Martha ladled half of the soup from the pot into a bowl.

She placed it on a tray and carried it to the master bedroom.

Ethan hadn't drunk much tonight, but he skipped dinner. His stomach was aching again.

Just as Martha brought the warm soup, he didn't refuse. He drank it all in one go.

Martha took the empty bowl and tray, exiting the room and softly closing the door.

Ethan lay on the bed, eyes closed, waiting for the stomach discomfort to slowly ease.

After some time, he felt his stomach improve, but his body grew increasingly hot.

He was about to get up and lower the air conditioning when the master bedroom door was pushed open from outside.

Isabella walked in barefoot.

She approached the bed, looking at the intoxicated man. A smile unconsciously touched her lips.

He must be warm. Two buttons of his collar were undone, his cheeks flushed a light pink.

His arm, hanging off the bed, was solid and powerful. His hand had distinct knuckles.

The dark shirt he wore today added to his aloof aura, making him seem unapproachable.

Isabella remembered their first time.

Ethan was just as drunk then, continuously calling out Sophia Sullivan's name.

Her gaze drifted over the slightly open shirt, past the man's prominent Adam's apple. Her heart stirred, and she pressed her body against his.

Her fingers lightly traced circles on the skin of his chest, subtly moving downward.

Suddenly, Ethan moved. He turned over, his back to her.

Isabella immediately straightened up, startled. A cold sweat broke out on her back.

She looked down at her nightgown, remembering it was wearing Sophia's clothes that initially caught his interest. An idea sparked. She walked to the wardrobe.

This time, she picked a lace nightgown. Modest in the front, but with a large open back.

It would make it very easy for a man's hands to slip inside.

She couldn't help but curse Sophia inwardly. "Bitch!"

Who was any better? Didn't they all use their bodies to tie a man down?

It took Sophia six years to get into Ethan's heart. Even after breaking up, he couldn't forget her. Well, she could do it too!

No, not just six years. She wanted to be the rightful Mrs. Roscente, entangled with him for a lifetime.

With this thought, her eyes gleamed with excitement. She pressed against him from behind, wrapping her arms around him, and began to tease...

The next second, Ethan, who should have been passed out drunk, suddenly opened his eyes.

He harshly yanked her climbing hands away.

Isabella cried out in surprise as she was thrown off the bed onto the floor.

Ethan stood over her, his face expressionless. "Pregnant and still thinking about this? You're truly despicable."

He then averted his gaze, as if looking at her would dirty his eyes.

Suddenly, his eyes paused and snapped back to Isabella.

More precisely, to the nightgown she was wearing.

It was Sophia's clothes.

A memory seemed to surface. His gaze turned sharp and dangerous. "That first time we slept together... did you also wear Sophia's nightgown?"

Isabella sat on the floor, her eyes wide and dazed, completely stunned.

"Answer me!" The man suddenly stepped forward, gripping her chin. His force increased.

"Pain—" Isabella's eyes reddened, tears falling one by one.

Ethan wasn't moved. His large hand was like a vice. Red marks quickly appeared on the woman's pale, tender cheeks.

"Answer me! Was it or not—"

Isabella shook her head. "No... I... I didn't... Ethan, you're hurting me..."

Ethan tugged at the nightgown she wore, a scornful laugh escaping him. "How do you explain this? If you hadn't done it before, how could you be so practiced?"

When they first got together, something felt off. He distinctly remembered holding and kissing Sophia the night before. How did he wake up to Isabella?

He chalked it up to drunken hallucination, mistaking her for someone else. It never crossed his mind he'd been set up!

The thought made his teeth grind with hatred.

"You're testing my limits!" He furiously dragged Isabella up from the floor. "You bitch, get out! Get out of this house right now!"

Rage and something else burned within him. Ethan felt even hotter.

His whole body felt like it was on fire...

He swayed slightly, his Adam's apple bobbing with restrained discomfort.

Wrong!

Ethan's expression turned severe. His current reaction was more like...

"Did you fucking drug me?!"

Isabella's eyes darted away, guilt written all over her face.

"Damn you! Where did you get the nerve?! How dare you?!"

He breathed heavily twice. The fire in his heart burned hotter, his eyes growing redder.

Isabella swallowed, pushing down her fear. She climbed up from the floor, tears still streaming, and moved toward him. "Ethan, I know you must be suffering right now..."

Ethan watched her coldly.

Isabella bit her lip. "I can help you, really..."

As she spoke, she began to remove her nightgown.

"You know I love you. I'd do anything willingly. Even if you see me as a substitute for another woman. Even if you call out Sophia's name while lying on my chest. I don't mind."

Moved by her own words, she might have even moved herself. "Ethan, let me help you, okay? You need me now. 
###Chapter 153

You need a woman. What Sophia couldn't do, I can. What she wouldn't do, I will."

She had lowered herself into the dust.

Unfortunately, flowers don't bloom in dust. The only outcome is being trampled.

"Heh..." Ethan laughed. "You, Sophia's substitute? Are you worthy? From head to toe, what about you compares to her? You're not even one percent similar."

"You drugged me, and now you stand here offering to 'help' me? Isabella, where is your shame?"

"Calling you 'despicable' insults the word. A bitch in heat has more dignity than you!"

The man's words grew harsher with each sentence, but Isabella seemed not to hear them. A seductive look mixed with the tears on her face.

Her smooth body pressed against his chest. She rose on her toes, her lips nearing his ear:

"I know you're suffering. It's alright. I'll help you. Just like our first time..."

Her feminine scent was like a sweet spring, momentarily quelling the dryness burning within him.

Making him unconsciously crave more...

Isabella watched the man's gradually dazed eyes and couldn't help but smile.

If she had known it would be this easy, she should have drugged him sooner...

Waiting until today to take this step, she suddenly felt she had been too conservative.

"Ethan, look at me..." Isabella turned his face toward hers.

Their eyes met. His gaze was fully on her.

Isabella leaned in to kiss him...

Just as their breaths mingled, about to intertwine, Ethan shoved her away violently.

The previous haze in his eyes was gone, replaced by utter clarity.

There wasn't the slightest hint of being controlled by any drug.
Isabella Langley was stunned.

"You... you didn't..."

"Surprised?"

The moment Ethan Roscente sensed something was wrong, he rushed into the restroom to induce vomiting.

The body heat was just residual effects of the drug.

"Then why... were you acting like that just now?"

Ethan tugged at the corner of his mouth. "Wanted to see what it looks like when someone goes from hope to despair. Quite entertaining."

A chill ran through Isabella's entire body.

"Bold, but unfortunately stupid."

"Martha—"

"Yes, sir?" Martha entered immediately.

Isabella fumbled frantically with her pajamas, her movements clumsy and panicked.

"Pack her things. Within thirty minutes, throw her out, along with her luggage. Change all the access codes. From now on, nothing related to her is allowed in this house."

"Yes, sir."

Isabella was dragged out forcibly.

Her face was expressionless as she allowed herself to be pulled.

Suddenly, she struggled violently. "Don't touch me!"

Martha paused.

"I'm carrying the Roscente heir! How dare a servant lay hands on me? Could you afford to compensate if the child is harmed?"

"Once I give birth to a son and marry Ethan, you'll be the first one I deal with!"

Martha laughed, her gaze looking at her as if she were a fool.

"Miss Langley, watched too many soap operas? Think getting pregnant makes you the lady of the house? I've been with the Roscentes for decades. Never seen anyone secure their position just with a child."

Victoria Roscente's stance was clear—the child could be born, but it would have nothing to do with you afterward.

Even the servants understood this logic, yet Isabella was still dreaming.

A flicker of pity crossed Martha's eyes.

Such a decent college student. Why humiliate herself like this?

She had heard every word the young master said outside the door.

How thick-skinned did one have to be to have so little shame?

Martha shook her head. "Miss Langley, go pack your luggage. See what you want to take."

This was a reminder to take anything valuable.

Isabella completely missed the point, feeling only insulted.

"Leave? Why should I leave? This is my home!"

"The young master has given the order. You must leave today."

"I'm not leaving. What can you do about it?"

Martha: "..."

Isabella gripped the railing tightly. "Go on, drag me out!"

Ethan emerged from the master bedroom, sneering. "Ten minutes are up. Martha, call security."

"Yes, sir."

Suddenly, Isabella's face turned pale. She clutched her stomach. "It hurts... my stomach hurts so much..."

Ethan's expression remained cold.

Martha didn't dare move.

Isabella slid to the floor, sweat beading on her forehead.

She grabbed the man's pant leg, pleading. "Ethan, save the baby, it really hurts..."

Martha couldn't bear to watch. "Sir, Miss Langley doesn't seem to be faking it..."

Cold sweat soaked her nightgown. Isabella curled up in pain.

Ethan tossed out a "You handle it" and turned to leave.

Martha inwardly lamented.

The life of an employee is truly bitter!

...

At four in the morning, an ambulance took Isabella away.

Coincidentally, it was the same hospital as Victoria.

Victoria had received a call from Martha early in the morning, saying Isabella was making a scene and refusing to leave.

This time, the situation seemed serious.

Victoria hurried to the hospital room.

Just outside the door, she heard wailing.

"Doctor, please! You must save the baby!"

"I can't lose him!"

The doctor tried to soothe her. "Please calm down, expectant mother! Agitation is bad for the fetus..."

Isabella grabbed the doctor's wrist. "Can the baby be saved? Tell me! My husband is rich! We can pay any amount!"

Victoria saw her hysterical state; the doctor couldn't get a word in.

If this continued, she really might lose the child.

Victoria stepped forward and slapped her directly.

"Had enough?"

The slap made Isabella even more frenzied. "You hit me? You old witch! It's all your fault! If you hadn't forced me to learn all those things, would I be in the hospital?"

Victoria sneered. "So what if I hit you? Keep this up and you will really lose the child!"

She had a headache.

How did she end up with such a fool?

She ruins herself and drags her grandson down with her!

Isabella wouldn't listen. "If the baby is lost, it's because of you!"

"If you hadn't pressured me, why would I fight with Ethan? Why would I end up in the hospital? Don't you think I want to have a healthy pregnancy?"
###Chapter 154
72 Million USD

Victoria Roscente's face turned pale with fury.

She had never met someone so skilled at twisting the truth.

"You're the one causing trouble, and now you blame me? Keep spouting nonsense, and I won't be polite!"

"Go ahead! Try to kill me today—"

"Martha!" Victoria trembled with rage. "Call Ethan Roscente immediately! Tell him to get over here now!"

"Yes, ma'am!"

The phone rang for a long time before it was answered.

Ethan's voice was cold. "What is it?"

"Young master, your mother requests your presence at the hospital."

"I'm busy."

"But... ma'am and Miss Isabella are having a terrible argument."

"Oh."

Martha was stunned.

Ethan's tone grew even colder. "Tell Victoria she insisted on keeping this child. Now that there's trouble, she can handle it herself. Don't bother me."

The call disconnected.

Attempts to call back went straight to voicemail.

"Ma'am, the young master said..."

Victoria pressed urgently, "What did he say?"

Martha forced herself to repeat it. "He said you created this mess, so you solve it. He wants no part of it."

Victoria's vision darkened.

Just then, Isabella Langley let out a piercing, agonized scream.

It was a hundred times more tortured than when she was being hit.

The hospital room descended into chaos.

A doctor rushed in. "The patient's condition is critical! Emergency procedures! All family members, out!"

Victoria's heart clenched.

Could the baby really be lost?

She regretted her earlier impulsiveness.

Half an hour later, the doctor emerged.

Victoria rushed forward. "Doctor, how is my grandson?"

The doctor frowned. "The fetus is stable for now. But the mother cannot endure any further stress. Next time, not even a miracle might save it."

Victoria exhaled in profound relief. "Thank you, Doctor. I'll be careful."

Amelia Roscente arrived in a hurry.

She had learned what happened from Martha.

She couldn't help muttering under her breath, "After all that drama, it's still fine. She's got nine lives..."

Victoria glanced toward the room. "Tiffany, help me with the discharge paperwork."

"Discharge? Didn't the doctor say you need to stay a few more days?"

"My grandson was almost lost! How can I stay here? I'm moving to the Beverly Hills mansion. I need to keep an eye on that troublemaker myself!"

Amelia was shocked. "Mom, are you insane? To wait on her? Like a servant?"

This was completely unlike Victoria.

Her obsession with a grandson was understandable.

But Amelia couldn't believe she would humble herself like this.

"What's really going on? Why are you so set on keeping this child?"

Victoria narrowed her eyes. "Remember your grandfather's will? The New Street Venture Capital Fund shares are to be redistributed in ten years."

"Vaguely. What does that have to do with Isabella Langley?"

"Silly girl, the New Street project's value has multiplied dozens of times. The second and third branches are eyeing it greedily. The distribution is per capita. Our branch is at the biggest disadvantage. But if your brother has a child, that child counts as a share."

"I'm pinning all my hopes on this child. Isabella's belly holds 72 million USD."

Amelia was stunned. "72 million USD?"

Victoria smiled and nodded.

Inside the room, Isabella heard every word clearly.

The soundproofing in the VIP room was terrible.

She gently touched her abdomen.

72 million USD...

How much money was that...

...

After Isabella was discharged, Victoria personally attended to her.

For the first two days, Isabella was extremely cautious.

She watched her diet and kept her emotions steady, terrified something might happen to the baby.

But she soon realized Victoria was bending over backwards for her.

Anything she wanted, she got. She was treated like royalty.

Ethan never returned.

He didn't answer calls or messages.

His disgust for Isabella had reached its peak.

Isabella stopped trying.

With the child came 72 million USD. Ethan's heart was no longer important.

Days passed.

Isabella's belly gradually swelled.

But she was never one to be content.

As soon as she felt a little better, she started causing trouble again.

"Aunt Victoria, I'm going for my check-up. I'd like the chicken soup you make when I get back."

Isabella stood at the door, her smile sweet.

Victoria sat on the sofa without looking up. "Have the cook make it."

"You misheard." Isabella's tone hardened. "I said you should make the chicken soup."

Victoria frowned.

Her eyes swept over Isabella's stomach. She swallowed her anger. "Fine. I'll make it."

"Thank you, Auntie."

The soup was just ready when Isabella returned from her check-up.

Victoria placed a bowl on the table. "Drink."

She served herself a bowl too.

It did smell more fragrant than the cook's.

"Aunt Victoria, are you pregnant too?" Isabella asked suddenly.

Victoria nearly choked on her soup.
###Chapter 155

"What?"

"You're not pregnant, so why are you drinking the soup? Isn't it inappropriate to take things meant for the mother-to-be?"

"It's such a large pot. Can you even finish it?"

"Of course I can."

"What exactly are you trying to say?"

Isabella Langley dropped the act. "Since it was stewed for me, it's best if others don't touch it. Don't you agree?"

"Fine," Victoria Roscente fumed, slamming her bowl down with a cold nod. "Keep it and drink it slowly yourself!"

She turned and stormed off.

Isabella raised a triumphant eyebrow.

She glanced at the two bowls of soup on the table, curling her lip in disdain.

Without taking a single sip, she went straight back to her room.

"Why didn't you drink the chicken soup?!"

Isabella had just woken up and yawned. "I suddenly didn't feel like it. Is that a problem?"

"You—"

"Auntie Victoria, please knock before entering my room. Your sudden appearances startle the baby."

Victoria Roscente was speechless.

That evening, Isabella sat in the living room watching TV.

Victoria suggested she take a walk in the garden, saying it was good for the fetus.

Isabella ignored her completely.

"Auntie Victoria, since you have so much free time, why not go buy me some wontons? The ones from Old Luigi's on the west side. They have the best flavor."

Victoria looked out the window. It was already dark.

Driving to the west side would take fifty minutes, nearly two hours round trip.

The wonton shop would be closed by now.

Even if it were open, the wontons would be a soggy mess by the time they got back.

"They're probably closed by now. If you want wontons, have Martha make some at home…"

Isabella spoke slowly. "Homemade ones can't compare to the ones from that shop. They close at eleven. There's still time to go and queue."

Victoria was, of course, unwilling.

Queue for wontons in the middle of the night?

How could she even suggest such a thing!

"The baby wants them, not me."

"If you won't go, that's fine. I can't sleep if I don't get them. If I don't sleep, your grandson will be uncomfortable."

"The doctor said my emotions shouldn't be agitated. I shouldn't be stressed…"

Victoria said, "Have the driver go, or order a delivery."

It wouldn't cost much.

Isabella blinked. "But the baby says it only wants the ones Grandma buys. What should we do?"

Victoria Roscente was speechless.

"Sigh, never mind. This is just how unloved children are," Isabella said, her face full of disappointment. "Hmm… My stomach seems to hurt again…"

"Fine!" Victoria gritted her teeth, her facial muscles twitching. "Grandma will go buy them!"

She angrily called for the driver. "To the west side."

Isabella smiled. "Martha, could you wash a plate of cherries for me?"

"Martha—I heard you're a great cook. I want wontons. Right now."

Martha frowned. "But Madam has already gone to buy some…"

"How long will it take for her to get back? I want some now!"

"Then I'll call and ask Madam to come back."

Isabella sneered. "No need. I want both the homemade ones and the ones from the shop."

Martha was speechless.

Heavens!

Victoria's trip was fraught with difficulty.

It started pouring rain on the way.

The wonton shop was deep in an alley, requiring a walk in, and there was a queue!

She finally managed to buy them and return, only to find the living room dark.

She asked Martha and learned Isabella had already eaten, said she was tired half an hour ago, and went upstairs to sleep.

Furious, Victoria threw the takeout container!

"That little bitch!" She'd deal with her sooner or later!

Wontons scattered everywhere, soup splashed, creating a mess.

Martha thought to herself?

Really, I'm exhausted.

…

The next day, Isabella said she had no appetite and wanted something flavorful.

Victoria prepared bird's nest soup, stewed fish maw, and made pork knuckle soup with beans, hoping to nourish her.

Isabella took one sip and spat it out.

"What kind of soup is this? It's so greasy. Is this for a pregnant woman? I said I wanted something flavorful. Is this flavorful? It tastes like pig stink!"

Victoria watched the soup she'd stewed all morning being rejected, her brow twitching. "This is pork knuckle soup with beans. It's good for the baby."

"Good for the baby, but unimportant for the mother? There's such a thick layer of oil on top. It makes me nauseous just looking at it. How can I drink it?"

Victoria took a deep breath. "What do you want then?"

"How can you be so stupid? Do I need to teach you such a simple thing? Can't you skim the fat off? How did someone with your intelligence survive this long…"

She showed no mercy, her words venomous and harsh.

No one had ever spoken to Victoria like that before. She instantly flew into a rage, standing up abruptly. "Who are you calling stupid? Isabella Langley, don't go too far!"

If she had paid closer attention, she would have noticed that Isabella's tone and the things she said were almost identical to what Victoria herself had previously said to Isabella.

That's right, Isabella was getting revenge.

She was carrying seventy-two million dollars in her belly.

Even if she couldn't marry into the wealthy family, she could use the child to get a sum of money.

Surely they'd give her at least one million, right?

With that much money, whether she married Ethan Roscente or not didn't matter.

He didn't care for her anyway.

Since she wasn't marrying into wealth, there was no need to please her future mother-in-law.

An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

Isabella said, "Are you yelling at me? I just asked you to skim off some fat, not do anything else. If you're so unwilling, you can leave. I never begged you to stay."

"If anything happens to the child in my belly… don't you regret it."

"!"

Victoria silently repeated "hold back" several times before calming down.

She started skimming the fat from the soup surface as Isabella demanded.

After working for over half an hour, Isabella only took a few sips.

Victoria was so angry she almost had a relapse of her vertigo…

The Roscente household was in chaos, but Sophia Sullivan's life was peaceful.

In mid-June, she visited Professor Eleanor Watson's home again.

The plants were easy to care for; just some watering and weeding.

She mainly wanted to check if the professor's leg had improved.

"You know," Professor Watson said, "I really think you chose the wrong major. You should have gone to medical school. I guarantee you'd learn faster and better than those medical students!"

Sophia checked the area that had been swollen last time. Finding the swelling had gone down and it was basically back to normal, she felt relieved.

"Alright, I'll take your suggestion seriously and consider it properly." Sophia nodded with feigned solemnity.

Professor Watson patted her lightly, chiding, "I was joking! Don't take it seriously."

Changing majors mid-stream? She was absolutely capable of doing something like that.

Just like Alexander Laurent all those years ago, stubbornly switching from biology to physics. Amidst a storm of skepticism and ridicule from the outside world, he still excelled.

No, he did even better!

Perhaps that's what genius is. No matter what they do, if they want to, they can definitely succeed.

"Where are the results from your most recent hospital check-up? Let me see."

prolonged illness makes a doctor of a patient. Although Sophia wasn't sick herself, having a sick person close to her for a long time meant she eventually learned to read CT scans and understand blood test reports.

"…Not bad. Although some indicators are still a bit high, most are normal now. It seems you've really been listening, resting properly during this time."

The housekeeper, who was selecting vegetables nearby, laughed. "That's right! On the days our Professor Watson forgets to take her medicine, you call to remind her. She can't forget even if she wants to."

"Ahem! Jade, say less. Save some face for me…"

Seeing Professor Watson's expression of having her secrets exposed, Sophia couldn't help but laugh. "Since this method works, we'll keep doing it from now on."

Professor Watson didn't respond, clearing her throat lightly and quickly changing the subject. "By the way, let me introduce you to someone."

"Who?"

"Sebastian, you can come out now."
###Chapter 156

Professor Eleanor Watson had just finished speaking.

A tall, straight-backed figure emerged from the inner room.

Sophia Sullivan froze.

Eleanor Watson smiled as she made the introduction. "This is Professor Benjamin Murphy's prized student, Sebastian Evans."

The man's lips curved into a slight smile as he extended his hand toward her. "Nice to meet you, junior."

"You... you're Professor Murphy's student?" Sophia couldn't hide her surprise.

"Does it not seem like it?"

"Well, it's not that..."

Eleanor's gaze shifted between the two of them. "You know each other?"

Sebastian gave a slight nod. "We do."

And we've known each other for a very long time...

"Perfect, since you're already acquainted. Why don't you both stay for dinner?"

Sebastian smiled. "Thank you, Professor. I won't stand on ceremony then."

Sophia had already planned to stay for dinner.

The housekeeper had prepared a table full of dishes, two of which were Sophia's favorites.

Whether intentional or not, Sebastian offered Sophia the seat closest to those two dishes and took the one next to her.

Eleanor noticed this and raised an eyebrow slightly.

Sophia simply thought it was a coincidence and didn't overthink it, inwardly praising the housekeeper for her thoughtfulness.

"What's your Chinese zodiac sign, Sebastian?" Eleanor asked suddenly.

Sebastian replied, "The Dog. I'm twenty-eight."

"Running an investment company at twenty-eight. Quite the impressive young man."

Sebastian waved his hand modestly. "You flatter me. The company only got started with my family's support. It's only been properly on track for the last two or three years."

"Compared to business, I have far more respect for scholars like you and Professor Murphy. Burying yourselves in experiments day after day, delving deeper into exploration year after year, enduring the solitude and tedium, devoting your entire lives to science."

Eleanor laughed. "For those who love research, that kind of life isn't lonely or dull at all. Right, Sophia?"

"Yes," Sophia nodded.

The lab was free of office politics. It was pure and simple. Comfortable.

At least, that was how it was for her and Professor Watson.

Sebastian seemed to have an epiphany. "It seems my view was too shallow. No wonder Professor Murphy said I was vulgar and not cut out for academia."

"Hahaha... Old Murphy really said that?"

"He did," Sebastian nodded. "Said it right in front of me and my parents."

"Hahaha... That does sound exactly like Old Murphy."

Sebastian was articulate and had extremely high emotional intelligence. Even his flattery was perfectly pitched.

In just a few sentences, he had Eleanor laughing heartily.

After dinner, Sophia proactively helped clear the table.

Sebastian actually rolled up his sleeves and followed her into the kitchen.

Sophia was a little surprised. After knowing him for so many years, she'd never heard of him setting foot in a kitchen.

"Why are you looking at me like that? Is it that strange?" Sebastian asked as he scraped leftovers into the trash.

Sophia said, "A little."

The man chuckled. "In your eyes, am I that useless?"

Sophia told the truth. "You used to be."

"..."

Ethan Roscente never set foot in the kitchen. Anyone who hung out with him probably wasn't much better.

Sebastian saw right through her thoughts and exclaimed, "That's guilt by association! I'm wronged!"

They cleaned the kitchen together. Although Sebastian tried his best to prove he wasn't "useless," the reality was—

He wasn't very good at it.

Not only were his movements clumsy, but he also squeezed dish soap onto every single plate and bowl. Under Sophia's helpless gaze, he looked utterly innocent. "Isn't this how you wash them?"

Sophia: "..."

"If you don't find it troublesome, you could teach me," Sebastian said, clearing his throat lightly. "When I cooked for myself abroad, I usually only used one or two plates. I'd just squeeze a little on each..."

"There's no fixed method for washing dishes. How you use the soap isn't set in stone either. As long as they get clean in the end, it's fine. But..."

She changed her tone. "From a conservation standpoint, you can squeeze some into the water first, let it dissolve, use a sponge to scrub, then give them a final rinse with clean water, let them drain, and put them away."

"Like this..." Sebastian listened and followed her instructions.

Just as he was about to dissolve the soap, Sophia suddenly spoke—

"Wait!"

Sebastian: "??"

"Use hot water."

"Oh, right!"

After cleaning up, they stayed a while longer. Seeing it was getting late, they said their goodbyes to Eleanor.

Sebastian said, "I drove here. Can I give you a lift?"

The subway had stopped running at this hour.

Sophia didn't put on airs. "Then thank you, Young Master Evans."

They got into the car.

Sebastian said, "If possible, I'd prefer you call me 'senior,' or maybe 'Bash'? Even just my full name is fine?"

"Okay, Young Master Evans."

"... You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?"

Sophia looked innocent. "It's a habit. Hard to break."

"Fine, call me whatever you like."

Sooner or later, he'd make her change her tune willingly.

...

Half an hour later, the car pulled up on Institute Road.

Sophia said, "You can just drop me off at the MIT entrance."

"Not going back to your place?"

"Need to stop by the lab. Two sets of data haven't come out yet. Working late."

"Okay."

The man didn't ask further questions, simply pulling over at the school gate.

Sophia got out and thanked him again.

Sebastian waved his hand. "Go on. Be careful."

"Okay."

It was already ten p.m. when Sophia reached the lab.

By the time the data came out, she had compiled it and tidied the lab bench, it was almost midnight.

She turned off the lights, checked all the power sources, and then locked the door behind her.

Kyoto was in the midst of its summer rainy season. It had been drizzling on and off since the day before yesterday.

Under the hazy yellow glow of the streetlights, fine, hair-like raindrops drifted down.

It was so late that the street was almost empty of pedestrians. Only the occasional car passed by.

The deep night added to the gloom.

Sophia opened her umbrella and stepped into the rain.

The surroundings were so quiet she could only hear her own footsteps.

Halfway there, the night wind suddenly picked up, whipping the fine rain into a frenzy. A stray cat let out a piercing cry from a corner.

Sophia was startled, her hand jerking, almost losing her grip on the umbrella.

She managed to catch it in time, but in those few moments, half of her body was already soaked.

Suddenly, footsteps sounded behind her.

It was the dull thud of men's dress shoes on the asphalt road.

She didn't pay it much mind at first, but she soon realized that when she walked faster, the footsteps quickened. When she slowed down, the footsteps slowed too.

So—

Someone was following her!
###Chapter 157

Sophia Sullivan suddenly remembered Zoe Langley's warning.

A pervert had been spotted near MIT.

He specifically targeted female students.

Especially at night.

Some girls had already been assaulted.

The police hadn't caught him yet.

Sophia's breath hitched.

She quickened her pace.

The footsteps behind her sped up too.

Her hand instinctively closed over her bag.

She often walked with Alexander Laurent.

But their busy schedules didn't always align.

Living alone, she always carried pepper spray.

She never thought she'd actually need it.

The footsteps closed in.

A shadow nearly fell over hers.

Sophia held her breath.

Her fingers found the cool canister.

She whirled around, spray ready—

"Sophia Sullivan!"

A familiar voice called out.

She looked up.

Sebastian Evans stood a few steps away, holding an umbrella.

One hand was in his pocket.

His gaze was sharp, fixed on something behind her.

The footsteps stopped abruptly.

The man hesitated for a second.

Then he turned and fled in panic.

Sebastian strode forward.

His stern expression softened instantly. "Are you okay?"

Sophia let out a long, shaky breath.

Only then did she realize her back was soaked with cold sweat.

Her limbs felt weak.

Sebastian steadied her with a light touch.

He pulled out his phone and made a call. "A-Chao, there's a creep following girls near the campus... Yeah, let me know immediately if you find anything."

Sophia was still trembling.

She couldn't speak.

Sebastian raised a hand as if to pull her close.

But he let it drop.

"Are you alright?"

If Charlie Lowell were here, he'd be shocked.

Sebastian Evans, being this gentle?

Sophia shook her head lightly. "I'm fine... Thank you."

Noticing her clothes were drenched, Sebastian took off his jacket and draped it over her shoulders.

"Come on, I'll walk you home."

Sophia didn't refuse.

She pulled the jacket tighter.

The black suit jacket held his residual warmth.

A faint scent of mint lingered around it.

Sebastian shared his umbrella with her.

He slowed his pace.

They walked in silence.

Sophia gradually calmed down.

"What are you doing here?"

"It's late. It wasn't safe for you to walk back from the lab alone."

"Were you waiting for two or three hours?"

"Mhm," he raised an eyebrow. "Turns out my wait wasn't in vain."

He chuckled softly. "No wait, no heroic rescue. Fair's fair. You reap what you sow."

Sophia couldn't help but laugh.

She was lucky he was here today.

"Thank you." She meant it.

Sebastian: "Always with the thank you. How about something else?"

"Like what?"

"Like 'You're so handsome,' 'I'm crazy about you,' 'Let's give dating a try,' 'Be my girlfriend'..."

"You're getting more and more ridiculous." Sophia laughed.

"I'm a man of action."

"Just keep dreaming."

Sebastian acted like he didn't hear. "Think it, then do it."

"It might not work out." She poured cold water on his idea.

"At least I tried. No regrets. What if it does work?"

Sophia fell silent.

They reached her staircase.

Sebastian stopped. "Go on up."

"Thank you."

"Call me if you need anything. I'll be there."

"Okay."

"Such a perfunctory answer. You're probably thinking: 'I'll agree now, but I won't actually call him if something happens.'"

The corner of Sophia's mouth twitched.

"I know you're independent. But when you need help, I hope you'll think of me. I don't need to be your first choice, but can I at least make the list?"

Sophia smiled. "Okay."

"Go on."

He watched her climb the stairs.

He waited until her light turned on.

Then he turned and left.

...

Isabella Langley had been resting at the Beverly Hills mansion for half a month.

Her pregnancy had stabilized.

She had servants to attend to her.

Ethan Roscente never came home.

No one insulted or humiliated her.

Life was comfortable.

After the morning sickness passed.

Her complexion became rosy.

She even gained five pounds.

Victoria Roscente worked like a slave.

She also had to endure Isabella's antics.

She hadn't lost weight.

But she looked haggard.

Her hair was falling out.

She couldn't sleep at night.

Isabella summoned her on a whim.

No matter if it was the middle of the night or early morning.

Victoria had to come running.

This happened so often.

That Victoria developed neurasthenia.

She often woke up from nightmares.

And couldn't sleep the whole night.

Isabella ate and slept well.

She shopped and swiped her card without restraint.

Victoria was annoyed.

She finally left Isabella at the mall.

And returned to the mansion alone.

Isabella came back to find Victoria sprawled on the sofa eating watermelon.

She immediately sneered. "You left me alone at the mall while you enjoy yourself? Some grandmother you are! What if something happened to me? You don't care about me, but what about your grandson?"

Victoria hadn't even swallowed her watermelon.

She was speechless. "The mall is full of security, and Martha was with you. What could happen? Paranoia much?"

"I'm doing this for my grandson, not for you. You want me to be at your beck and call 24/7? You're not worth it."

She finished with a contemptuous snort and an eye roll.

She couldn't be bothered to deal with her.

Isabella was furious.

She gritted her teeth.

Then she suddenly relaxed.

She lazily told the housekeeper to wash the cherries.

She prepared to go to the backyard to sunbathe.

"Oh, Martha, bring me my sunscreen."

The doorbell suddenly rang.
###Chapter 158

Ethan's assistant arrived unexpectedly.

He looked flustered and said the CEO urgently needed an important document from the study.

Victoria didn't dare delay and immediately took him upstairs.

"Is this the one?"

The assistant nodded in confirmation.

"Get this to Ethan quickly. Don't let it hold up his work."

Isabella Langley strolled casually toward the guest room, pretending to pass by the study.

She noticed the door was slightly ajar.

After confirming the hallway was empty, she gently pushed the door open and slipped inside…

Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves stood in neat rows, packed with files.

A pearwood tea table sat by the window, adorned with an elegant tea set.

To the left, a light-colored solid wood desk held a pen holder and a few scattered books.

This study was usually kept locked.

Only Martha was allowed in for weekly cleanings.

Isabella had always been forbidden from entering.

But now, here she was.

A smug smile curled her lips as she approached the desk.

Two manila folders lay on its surface.

Neither was sealed.

She picked one up at random and pulled out the documents inside.

They were filled with incomprehensible professional jargon and data.

She randomly pulled out one sheet and slipped it into the other folder.

Then she carefully returned everything to its original state.

Just then, Victoria's footsteps approached from down the hall. "Martha, where is Isabella? She was just in the living room. Where did she go?"

Isabella's heart jumped. She quickly slipped out of the study.

She leaned against the wall, pretending to scroll through videos on her phone.

Victoria frowned. "I thought you were going out for some sun? Why are you up here?"

Isabella smiled faintly. "It got too hot outside. I changed my mind. Pregnant women are sensitive to heat, didn't you know?"

Victoria was used to her sharp tone. Though annoyed, she didn't press the issue.

"Suit yourself. Just don't do anything to harm my grandson."

Isabella pursed her lips.

That evening, Ethan came home, a rare occurrence.

He didn't even change his shoes, heading straight upstairs to retrieve the files.

As he was about to leave, he paused.

The company folders, while standard issue, came from two different suppliers.

One was a slightly darker shade of manila, the other lighter.

He distinctly remembered placing the darker one on top of the lighter one.

Now their positions were reversed…

Someone had been in his study!

Downstairs, Victoria, seeing her son home, moved to go up and speak with him.

She stopped when she saw Ethan emerge from the study, his face dark.

"Mom, did you go into my study?"

Victoria nodded. "Your assistant came for the file yesterday. I let him in. Why?"

"Did you touch the two folders on the desk?"

"The desk? I only opened the drawer. I didn't touch anything else. I didn't see any folders."

Ethan held up the file in his hand. "This has been tampered with."

Isabella feigned surprise. "The study? Only Victoria and the assistant went in yesterday. The assistant wouldn't dare mess with things. That only leaves…"

Ethan looked at Victoria.

Her face paled. "Be quiet! I'm speaking with my son. This is none of your business!"

She turned back to Ethan. "I did go into the study, but the assistant waited outside the door. I only opened the drawer to get the file. I didn't touch anything else."

"Maybe Martha moved them while cleaning?"

Martha spoke up quickly. "The young master gave strict orders not to touch anything in the study during cleaning. I've always been very careful."

Ethan said, "It wasn't Martha. The study is only cleaned once a week. Yesterday wasn't the day."

Isabella slowly scooped a spoonful of bird's nest soup. "I don't even have a key. I couldn't get in. It seems the only possibility is Victoria."

Victoria trembled with rage. "How dare you?! Those are my son's documents! Why would I sabotage them? I'm not stupid. What good would that do me?"

Isabella shrugged. "Who knows? It certainly wasn't me. Besides, wasn't someone throwing a fit just the other day?"

It had been a minor incident, but bringing it up now made it seem significant.

Ethan had checked the files. Nothing was missing, but one page had been swapped.

It seemed like a petty act of mischief.

It wouldn't be out of character for Victoria.

Lately, he hadn't been home or answering her calls. It was plausible she was acting out her frustration.

"Let it go. The documents are still here. But Mom…" Ethan looked up, his voice cold. "Don't do this again. A mistake in the contract could cost millions."

With that, he strode out.

Victoria was crushed by the injustice. Her own son didn't believe her!

"No… Ethan, listen to me…"

"I'm going to the office. We'll talk later."

He clearly didn't want to hear her explanation.

Watching her son leave, Victoria felt the bitter taste of being wrongly accused with no way to clear her name.

Isabella, finding the flames not high enough, put down her spoon and pushed the bowl away.

"This bird's nest soup is terrible! Martha—make another serving!"

"Eat, eat, eat! Someone with your low-class taste has no right to eat bird's nest soup?!"

Victoria trembled with anger, recalling how Isabella had fanned the flames earlier, clearly trying to drive a wedge between mother and son.

It was utterly malicious!

Isabella frowned. "What do you mean? Who are you calling low-class? Do you even want your grandson anymore?!"

That only made Victoria angrier.

For the past two weeks, Isabella had done nothing but hold the "grandson" over her head.

For the sake of that unborn child, Victoria had endured countless grievances, running around like a pack mule being ordered about.

And the result?

Not an ounce of gratitude, and now this attempt to sow discord!

Her pent-up emotions finally exploded. She couldn't hold back anymore. "What utter nonsense! I've had enough! A grandson from someone like you? Perhaps it's better off not being born! Do whatever you want! See if I care!"

With that, Victoria stormed upstairs.

Soon, she came back down with a suitcase and summoned the driver, along with the housekeepers.

"Let's go. Back to the old house."
###Chapter 159

The entire household staff was visibly relieved.

They could finally see the back of this unwelcome guest.

Heaven had answered their prayers.

It was a blessing.

For the first time, they felt their mistress had made a brilliant decision.

The vast mansion was soon empty except for Isabella Langley.

She stood alone in the deserted living room, staring into space.

…

Night deepened. The Roscente family estate was brightly lit.

Amelia Roscente had just stepped inside when she saw her mother, Victoria Roscente, reclining on the sofa.

A professional therapist was massaging her shoulders and neck.

"Mom? You're back?"

"Hmm."

"Weren't you taking care of Isabella Langley?"

It had been over half a month. Why had she returned so suddenly without a word?

It was very unusual.

Victoria snorted coldly. "Don't mention her to me. The very name disgusts me!"

"What happened?" Amelia sat down beside her. "What's going on?"

Victoria began pouring out her grievances, listing every indignity she had suffered over these days.

By the end, she pushed the masseuse away and stood up abruptly.

She crossed her arms and launched into a furious tirade at the empty air.

"...I have never seen such a shameless woman! If I'd known, I would have preferred Ethan stay with Sophia Sullivan!"

At least Sophia was cultured and knew her place.

You don't appreciate what you have until it's gone. Victoria was now filled with bitter regret.

Seeing her mother so upset, Amelia's eyes also reddened.

A simmering anger burned in her chest.

It seemed that last slap hadn't been hard enough.

She should have landed a few more!

"And your brother," Victoria said, her voice cracking with genuine hurt at the mention of her son. "He actually believed that bitch's lies! He thought I tampered with his files! And he refused to apologize! He'd rather trust an outsider than his own mother! I'm his mother!"

Amelia was incensed. "Ethan has gone too far! I'm calling him right now—"

She immediately pulled out her phone.

Victoria did not stop her.

She wasn't going to take the blame for this.

The phone rang for half a minute before it was answered—

"Ethan! Did you know Mom is home?"

Ethan Roscente was in a private room at a club with Charlie Lowell, discussing a collaboration.

The short drama market was booming lately.

Charlie had invested in several media companies, perfectly catching the trend and making a fortune.

But no one ever complained about having too much money.

He wanted to bring Ethan in to expand the operation and get a larger slice of the pie.

They had basically reached an agreement, planning for their subordinates to sign the contract the next day.

Amelia's call came through at that moment.

"Home? Which home?"

"The family estate, of course! She was so upset by you and Isabella that her dizziness nearly flared up again! And what are you two doing? One is living it up at the mansion, and the other is having fun at some club!"

The music on the other end was deafening, with a heavy bass beat, clearly from an entertainment venue.

Victoria cooperatively held her forehead and let out a low moan.

Ethan frowned. "Is Mom okay? Has she been to the hospital?"

Amelia sneered. "Now you're concerned? Where were you earlier? You and Isabella are two of a kind! Mom was kind enough to look after her, but she deliberately made trouble. And you actually believed her over your own mother."

"Ethan, I'm so disappointed in you!"

She hung up directly.

Ethan held his phone, looking dazed.

Disappointed?

Perhaps…

He curled his lips in a self-mocking smile.

Charlie hadn't heard the whole conversation, but from the fragments, he guessed it was a family matter.

Remembering Ethan's current situation, he wasn't sure how to comfort him.

Ethan ordered a bottle of vodka and began drinking one glass after another.

Seeing him drink like this, Charlie quickly tried to dissuade him.

"Ethan, this is too strong. You should slow down…"

He didn't want him ending up in the hospital again…

Ethan ignored him, clutching his glass tightly. "Your phone. Give it to me."

"What for?" Charlie asked, puzzled, but handed it over anyway.

His hand was only halfway there when Ethan snatched the phone and quickly dialed Sophia Sullivan's number.

Soon, a familiar female voice came through.

He was like a desert traveler seeing an oasis, speaking urgently. "Sophia, I miss you so much…"

Sophia: "?"

Charlie: "!" Oh no… She'll probably never answer his calls again after this…

"Sophia, come back, please? I know I was wrong… We promised to grow old together. How could you just leave me?"

"Let's let bygones be bygones. Whether you want to pursue your master's degree or work, I'll support you…"

"Last year, we said we'd go to Turkey to watch the sunset and count the stars. Have you forgotten all that?"

He was rambling, his voice hoarse.

His demeanor was utterly pathetic.

But there was only silence on the other end.

Ethan continued, "It was all my fault in the past… Now I finally understand how much you sacrificed for me… Sophia, I love you. I can't live without you…"

Sophia: "Are you done?"

She finally responded.

However—

"I heard congratulations are in order. You're going to be a father."

"Beep—beep—"

A single sentence sent him straight to hell.

Ethan's eyes went blank. The phone slipped from his hand.

She said congratulations.

Ha… She actually said congratulations?!

So she knew! She knew everything!

Charlie asked cautiously, "Ethan, are you okay? What did Sophia say?"

Ethan waved his hand with a laugh. "Enough talk. Let's drink! Tonight, we drink until we drop!"

He then picked up the bottle and started guzzling it directly.

Horrified, Charlie tried to stop him. "You can't drink like that… This is vodka!"

Ethan suddenly paused. "Charlie, tell me… if I drank myself to death, would she come to see me? Just once?"

Charlie's heart pounded with fear. "Ethan, don't talk like that. Please, don't…"

When Charlie helped Ethan out later, aside from slightly flushed cheeks, he seemed fairly sober.

"Ethan, let me drive you home…"

"No need." Ethan waved him off, taking his jacket from Charlie's arm. "I'll go back myself."

Seeing he was coherent, Charlie didn't insist. "Alright, send me a message when you get home."

The night was deep, the moonlight cold.

Pushing the door open, the mansion was as silent as a tomb.

Ethan went straight upstairs to his study.

He turned on the computer and pulled up the surveillance footage.

When the villa's security system was designed, the security team had recommended installing cameras.

He had discreet ones installed but never used them.

Now he wanted to see who had really tampered with the files.

He wanted to see how Isabella and Victoria usually interacted day to day.

Accessing the storage drive, he found it contained surveillance recordings from the past year.

There were twelve folders, organized by month.

On a whim, he clicked open the earliest one.

From exactly one year ago.

Back when he and Sophia Sullivan were still together.
###Chapter 160

The surveillance footage was frozen at 6 PM.

The living room was empty.

Sophia Sullivan sat alone on the sofa.

Ethan Roscente understood with just one glance.

She was waiting for him to come home.

There was no sound from the television.

No light from a phone screen.

She just sat there quietly.

Like a rose gradually losing its moisture.

So this was the so-called warmth of home he had yearned for.

It was merely bought by a woman's day after day of waiting.

Through her accommodation.

Through her sacrifices.

Through her entire self.

"When I was a child, my father was always busy with work."

"My mother was always busy socializing."

"They left me with the nanny."

"Even though we were well-off and both parents were present."

"I never experienced the warmth of a family."

"Sophia, I truly envy you."

"You have loving parents."

"You grew up in a caring environment."

"Everything was done personally."

"My parents still believe to this day."

"That money can solve all problems."

"If a child isn't good enough."

"It must be because not enough money was spent."

"Meeting you is my greatest fortune."

"You made me feel this warmth."

"Since being with you."

"I always imagine this scene."

"Coming home from work to see you busy in the kitchen."

"Children playing in the living room."

"The three of us, or even more."

"Having dinner together."

"After dinner, the children play in the garden."

"You sit on the swing."

"I gently push from behind."

"We watch the children laugh and run."

"Sophia, believe me."

"We will continue like this."

"Until we grow old together."

"Until death parts us."

Ethan's ears echoed with these words from the past.

He said he longed for family warmth.

He longed for a virtuous wife and filial children.

As time passed.

He had long forgotten.

But Sophia remembered clearly.

And used her actions to paint the future he had once promised.

But now.

Everything was destroyed by his own hands.

Completely ruined.

Ethan raised his hand and slapped himself.

The sharp sound was particularly piercing in the night.

But it was useless now.

He had lost her.

Lost the life he yearned for.

Lost the woman who loved him most in the world.

A tear slid from the man's eye.

It fell onto the table.

Shattering.

Staining the expensive sandalwood surface.

Looking cheap and dirty.

The recording time jumped to 1 AM.

"He" finally returned.

Reeking of alcohol.

He walked directly past her sleeping on the sofa.

And went upstairs.

Right after "he" left.

Sophia slowly opened her eyes.

She stared blankly at the crystal chandelier.

One second.

Two seconds.

A full three minutes.

Then she sat up.

Gazing blankly in the direction "he" had left.

So she hadn't been asleep at all.

What was Sophia thinking at that time.

The present Ethan couldn't guess.

And didn't dare to guess.

Perhaps disappointment accumulates bit by bit like this.

Breaking up isn't an impulsive decision.

It's the stacking of day after day of disappointment.

The consumption of love day after day.

The inevitable final outcome.

He subconsciously believed this woman would never leave.

That's why he dared to be so reckless.

And what he had once squandered.

Ultimately became what he could no longer obtain.

Ethan remained silent before the screen for a long time.

Until the wind howled outside the window.

Then he remembered the purpose of checking the surveillance.

He opened the video files from the past month.

Isabella Langley had originally been asleep.

Faintly hearing the door open downstairs.

She instantly woke up.

The corners of her mouth unconsciously turned up.

She had spoken so harshly when leaving.

Yet just a few hours later.

He came running back.

That old witch Victoria Roscente was just a wretched scum.

If she had the guts, she would really leave her alone here.

Anyway, she still had 72 million USD in her belly.

Who was afraid of whom.

If Victoria returned.

Martha and the cook would definitely come back too.

Perfect timing since she was hungry.

She'd have the cook prepare some bird's nest soup.

Isabella circled the living room.

Then checked the kitchen.

There was no one.

She looked around in confusion.

Suddenly noticing a pair of men's leather shoes in the entryway.

Ethan had returned.

Her eyes darted around.

She quickly went to the bedroom to change into sleepwear.

Then tiptoed toward the study.

Knock knock knock—

"Ethan, you're back, right?"

Asking a question she already knew the answer to.

The study light was on.

Who else could it be but Ethan.

Just as Isabella thought she wouldn't get a response.

A deep, cold male voice came from inside.

"Come in."

Suppressing her excitement.

She pushed the door open with a smile.

"Ethan..."

Ethan looked up at the approaching woman.

A red lace nightgown.

A sheer design at the chest.

Two thin straps resting on snow-white shoulders.

No charm.

Only vulgarity.

Seeing the man's calm expression.

Isabella softened her tone.

"When did you get back? Working overtime again? You've been working overtime for over half a month, you must be exhausted. Here, let me give you a massage..."

She proactively offered a reason for the man's absence for over half a month.

Smiling without any reservation.

As if their previous intense conflict had never happened.

Ethan looked at her almost ingratiating smile.

It didn't matter anymore.

No matter how much he loathed her.

The one who felt disgusted was himself.

No matter how much he despised her.

It wouldn't change the current situation.

Better to ignore it.

The man's calmness, in Isabella's eyes.

Became tacit permission.

She placed her hands on Ethan's shoulders.

Seeing he didn't refuse.

She boldly moved her hands toward his chest.

"Ethan, you haven't been home for over half a month. Don't you miss me? Don't you miss the baby?"

Ethan grabbed her hand before it could go further.

Isabella froze.

"Who exactly entered the study and moved the documents? Do you know?"

"How... how would I know?" Isabella laughed. "Although it's very likely that Auntie Victoria did it, I don't think she meant any harm. What can't be resolved between mother and son? Even if it really was Auntie Victoria, you shouldn't take it to heart..."

"Is that so?" Ethan said with a mocking smile.

"Sigh, Auntie Victoria might really be angry. She took Martha and the others back to the old house. I didn't dare to stop her, but the baby and I still need someone to take care of us. Given the current situation, Ethan, what do you think we should do?"

"What do you want to do?"

"Forget about Auntie Victoria, she might still be angry. But shouldn't Martha, the cook, and the driver at least stay for me?"

Ethan let out a cold laugh.

Isabella: "?"

"I'm asking you one last time. Are you sure it was my mother who moved the documents?"

The woman's eyes flickered. "Auntie Victoria is the most suspicious. That's a公认的事实, isn't it?"

Slap— Slap—

Ethan suddenly stood up and slapped her twice.

Then he grabbed Isabella's hair.

Pressing her face toward the screen.

"Then how do you explain this?"
###Chapter 161

The surveillance footage clearly recorded her sneaking into the study late at night.

Her careful actions of switching the files were captured in perfect detail.

Next, clips of her usually ordering Victoria Roscente around were played.

Her words were vicious, her demeanor arrogant.

Isabella Langley's face instantly turned deathly pale.

Ethan Roscente slapped her twice across the face.

The force was so heavy it made her ears ring.

"I thought you were just vain and shallow. I didn't expect you to be a pathological liar."

"Even more skilled at stirring up trouble and sowing discord."

His gaze was as cold as ice.

"I'm hitting you to make you recognize your place."

"Stop your delusional fantasies."

"And stop causing more trouble."

"Otherwise—"

Ethan leaned in slightly, his voice dropping to a whisper.

"You'll learn there are things in this world worse than death."

Isabella retreated in fear.

She couldn't even register the burning pain on her cheeks.

"Ethan... I know I was wrong..."

Her voice trembled, tears streaming down.

"I'll go apologize to Aunt Victoria right now."

"She can hit or scold me, I won't make a sound."

"I'll do anything to make her forgive me."

Ethan watched her expressionlessly.

His eyes showed no hint of softening.

Isabella panicked completely.

She fell to her knees with a thud.

"I really didn't mean to..."

"Maybe the pregnancy hormones are making me unstable."

"That's why I couldn't control my emotions with Aunt Victoria..."

She cried pitifully, tears falling like rain.

Ethan watched coldly, unmoved.

"...Finished?"

Isabella froze.

"Done crying?"

"Ethan..."

"Go pack your things if you're done."

"...What?"

A cold smile touched Ethan's lips.

"I wasn't joking when I told you to get out."

"Letting you stay this long was already more than you deserved."

"No! You can't do this to me!"

Isabella shook her head wildly.

The terror of being thrown out made her whole body tremble.

"I'm carrying your child!"

"You can't kick me out!"

Ethan directly called security.

"I'm not leaving... I absolutely refuse..."

Isabella completely lost control.

She lunged at Ethan.

"Why should I leave?!"

"Your mother cares so much about this baby!"

"How will you explain it to her if you throw me out?!"

Ethan was caught off guard as she grabbed him.

A rain of fists pounded against his body.

"Ethan Roscente! You have no conscience!"

"I'm pregnant and you're still thinking about your ex!"

"I won't go! I'd rather die here!"

Isabella acted completely crazed, crying and making a scene.

Ethan, utterly annoyed, pushed her away.

Isabella staggered and crashed into the wall.

A dull thud echoed.

But she charged at him again immediately.

This time, Ethan sidestepped to avoid her.

Isabella couldn't stop her momentum and slammed hard into the edge of the desk.

Her face changed dramatically, her whole body stiffening.

A warm flow gushed out between her legs.

She looked down.

Bright red blood dripped down her inner thigh.

It bloomed into a glaring red on the floor.

One drop, then another.

She felt something detaching, disappearing.

"Ah—my baby—"

A piercing shriek tore through the night sky.

...

Ethan took her to the hospital and then turned to leave.

After all, she'd been here so many times.

When was it ever real?

It was just the same old trick.

He wanted to see how long she could keep up this act.

"The pregnant patient's family? We need a signature for the induced labor procedure!"

The nurse hemmed and hawed.

The doctor frowned and urged, "Hurry up!"

"The family member already left..."

"What do you mean, left?"

"This is a Concierge Medicine patient. She's been hospitalized several times before."

Dr. Walters, on duty tonight, wasn't familiar with the situation.

But the nurse knew all too well.

Every time this patient was admitted, the entire nursing station suffered.

"Contact the family immediately! The fetus has no heartbeat, and the patient is hemorrhaging. It's very dangerous if we delay any longer!"

"The man who brought her in just left her here..."

The doctor was furious.

Enough money for Concierge Medicine, but no time to stay with his wife?

Wealthy families really only did shitty things!

"Someone always came to visit before, right? Check the visitor logs, contact anyone."

"Okay!"

...

Victoria Roscente was fast asleep.

Her phone was on silent, the screen lighting up and then going dark.

It happened four or five times before finally falling silent.

Amelia Roscente was at an all-night party.

The music was deafening.

"Tina, your phone is ringing."

She glanced at the caller ID; it was a landline number.

She declined the call directly.

The caller tried again.

She answered impatiently.

The noisy background drowned out the voice on the other end.

"The hospital? Isabella Langley? She's playing her games in the hospital again?"

"Miscarriage? Impossible, her stomach is tough as nails!"

"Sign? I'm busy, I don't have time!"

"Let her play by herself, don't bother me..."

"Hello? I can't hear you... Even if the director calls, it's useless!"

"I'm hanging up, do whatever you want!"

She put away her phone, raised her glass with a smile.

"Whose turn is it to drink? Next!"

...

The nurse put down the phone, fuming.

She returned to the operating room to report.

"...What do you mean, no one cares?"

"Exactly what it sounds like."

The doctor was shocked. "Her parents? Can we contact them?"

The nurse lowered her voice. "Dr. Walters, this patient's situation is a bit special."

"Pregnant out of wedlock, trying to marry into a wealthy family using the baby."

"The man didn't want it initially; it was his mother who insisted on keeping it."

"But she herself is just too much trouble..."

"Last time she was hospitalized, she had a huge fight with the man's mother."

"She's cried wolf too many times. No one believes her now."

The story of the boy who cried wolf was never a joke.

Dr. Walters sighed.

"The surgery must be done."

"Since we can't reach the family, follow the emergency protocol."

"File a report to the hospital administration explaining the situation."

"Check the operating room surveillance, follow procedure strictly to avoid future disputes."

Everything was arranged.

Dr. Walters put on her gloves, her gaze calm.

"Prepare for surgery."
###Chapter 162
Ignore It.

Isabella Langley opened her eyes.

The hospital room was stark white.

She instinctively reached for her abdomen.

The flatness made her freeze instantly.

Where was the baby?

Where was her child?

"Doctor! Doctor!" She sat up abruptly, her voice hoarse.

A nurse hurried in at the sound.

"My baby? Tell me my baby is still there, right?" She grabbed the nurse's hand, her nails digging deep into the other woman's flesh.

The nurse winced in pain but explained patiently, "Miss Langley, please calm down. The baby is... gone."

"Impossible!" Isabella shrieked. "You're lying! You didn't try hard enough! Why did you perform surgery without my consent? Who gave you the right!"

A doctor arrived, drawn by the commotion.

He faced Isabella's accusations with a calm expression.

"Miss Langley, you were hemorrhaging severely when you arrived. The fetus had no heartbeat."

"To save your life, an immediate procedure was necessary."

"We attempted to contact your family, but no one answered."

"The surgery was performed with hospital authorization."

"The entire process followed medical protocols. There is surveillance footage as evidence."

Isabella stood frozen in place.

Tears streamed down her face silently.

The doctor sighed and turned to leave.

...

Top-floor conference room, Roscente Group.

Ethan Roscente had just finished a cross-border video conference.

His assistant approached quickly, phone in hand.

"Mr. Roscente, the hospital has called several times."

The man's steps faltered slightly.

"Which hospital?"

"OB/GYN at Massachusetts General Hospital."

Ethan's eyes turned cold.

"Ignore it."

The assistant hesitated. "They've called six times. It seems urgent..."

Ethan shot him a icy glare.

The assistant immediately fell silent.

...

At the nurses' station, two on-duty nurses looked at each other.

"Still no answer?"

"Nope. Said he's her husband. How can he be unreachable?"

"I'll go ask the patient again..."

"Don't waste your energy," the older nurse stopped her. "I expected this."

"What do you mean?"

"You didn't see the work chat? The one in the VIP room is the mistress. Threw her weight around because of the pregnancy."

"Now look. She lost the baby."

"Really? She seems so young..."

"A college student. Kept by a wealthy heir. Wanted to use the child to secure her position."

"What do we do now? We can't reach the family. The head nurse is about to do rounds."

"Try contacting that 'mother-in-law'."

The call connected quickly.

"Hello, this is OB/GYN at Massachusetts General Hospital. Regarding Miss Langley's situation..."

Victoria Roscente cut her off. "What now? More life-or-death drama? Tell her to drop dead somewhere else. Don't bother me!"

She hung up immediately.

The two nurses looked at each other, speechless.

"Being a mistress really doesn't pay off."

...

Isabella lay in the hospital for two full days.

During that time, she developed an infection from the hemorrhage and went back into surgery.

When she was wheeled out, her face was as pale as paper.

Only a hired aide was there to care for her.

She called Ethan Roscente and Victoria Roscente countless times.

All calls went unanswered.

She asked the nurses to help contact them. The result was the same.

They had abandoned her.

The physical agony and mental collapse made her increasingly volatile.

The nurses' station complained bitterly but had no choice but to serve her.

She was, after all, a VIP patient.

...

Victoria found out about the lost baby three days later.

Amelia Roscente called while Victoria was getting a spa treatment.

"Mom, that baby is gone. Forget the 72 million. Let's just take what's rightfully ours."

Victoria was stunned for a moment.

A wave of disappointment washed over her.

For the lost 72 million, and for the grandchild she never met.

But then she thought, a child from that kind of woman was better off gone.

It saved future trouble.

She even began to miss Sophia Sullivan.

Though from an ordinary family, she was at least sensible and considerate.

Much better than Isabella Langley.

...

Isabella lay in her hospital bed, staring blankly out the window.

She had no tears left.

Why didn't Ethan come?

Didn't Victoria care most about this grandson?

Why didn't either of them show up?

She waited and waited, until her heart turned to ashes.

The first person to visit her turned out to be...
###Chapter 163

A former roommate.

Madison Klein took Isabella Langley's hand.

Her fingertips were icy cold.

"Bella, how did you get so thin?"

"I heard you need to rest after a miscarriage, or you'll have health problems later. You must be careful…"

Isabella snatched her hand back.

Her eyes turned cold.

"Who had a miscarriage?"

Madison was stunned.

"You're the one who had a miscarriage! I'm perfectly fine! Nothing happened at all!"

"Bella…"

"Here to laugh at me? Not a chance!" Isabella sat up sharply, bristling with hostility. "Think I'm down so everyone can kick me?"

"Madison, drop that fake concern. You were always jealous I had a wealthy boyfriend back in the dorm."

"A starved camel is still bigger than a horse. The things I've had, you'll never even touch in your lifetime!"

Madison was completely bewildered.

She couldn't understand a word Isabella was saying.

Isabella sneered. "Visiting me is just an excuse. You're really here to chase rich men, right? We're all foxes here, no need for the act. I see right through you!"

"You—" Madison's face flushed red with anger. "You're impossible! I came here out of kindness, and this is the thanks I get?"

She had originally planned to encourage Isabella to apply for reinstatement.

Even if the dream of marrying into wealth was shattered, she could still hold onto her education.

Graduating and finding a job to support herself should be manageable.

Now it seemed completely unnecessary.

Some people were already blinded by luxury.

Trapped in the pit of fame and fortune, unwilling to climb out.

Madison stood up.

"Our friendship ends here. We're not the same kind of people. No need to keep in touch. Let's pretend we don't know each other if we meet again."

"Who wants to keep in touch with you? Who wants to know you? Get out—get out now—" Isabella screamed at her retreating back.

Madison left without looking back.

After the outburst, Isabella collapsed onto the bed, exhausted.

She gasped for air.

Her phone suddenly rang.

She snatched it up like a lifeline—

"Ethan, why haven't you come to see…"

"Who are you calling, you wretched girl?"

A woman's shrill voice, mixed with the clatter of mahjong tiles, came through the line.

Isabella froze.

"You hear me, wretched girl? Pretending to be deaf for your mother?"

"Mom…" Isabella's lips trembled.

"My luck's been bad. Transfer some money over."

"I just gave you five thousand last time!"

"What can five thousand do? Hurry up, don't delay my game."

Isabella took a deep breath. "I don't have any money."

"Stop pretending! You just bought your brother the latest iPhone, nearly ten thousand! How come you have no money for me?"

"Mom, I really don't have any…" Isabella felt utterly drained.

"Bullshit! Don't think I don't know you hooked up with some big shot in the city. The scraps from his table are enough for our family to live well. Now you tell me you have no money? Think you can fly away with hardened wings?"

Deborah Melville spat in disgust.

"Let me tell you, no way! I spent a fortune sending you to college in the city. Have you forgotten your roots after just a few years? Believe me, I can put you up there, and I can drag you down too!"

Isabella cried angrily, her voice hoarse from shouting. "I said I have no money! No money! I just don't have it! Kill me and I still won't have it! What else do you want me to do?!"

Deborah only heard the words "no money."

"If you have no money, go sleep with a man! The money will come after you sleep with him! Haven't you learned anything since you were a child?!"

"What man? No one wants me anymore! Who am I supposed to sleep with?!" Isabella yelled.

Finally, Deborah sensed something was wrong.

Concerned about her cash cow, she finally left the card table for a quiet corner.

"What do you mean no one wants you? What about that wealthy boyfriend? Weren't you saying you were about to marry into a rich family last time? What happened?"

"Did they change their minds?"

Thinking her mother was showing concern, Isabella's grievances surged. She cried and recounted everything that had happened.

Deborah listened, furious.

"This family has no decency! My daughter, pure and innocent, slept with him, even got pregnant, and he just says he doesn't want her anymore?"

Not even any compensation. It was too much!

A shrewd glint flashed in the woman's eyes.

"Wait there, sweetie. Your mother and brother are booking tickets right now to back you up! This matter absolutely cannot be dropped just like that!"

…

Sophia Sullivan's thesis was in its final stages.

She had practically been living in the lab recently.

Zoe Langley remarked, "You're pushing yourself too hard!"

Sophia sighed helplessly.

She had no assistant or teammates. What else could she do but push herself?

After lunch, she went to the break room for her usual nap.

No matter how busy, she always made time to rest.

It was the only way to work efficiently in the afternoon.

Alexander Laurent had a full schedule of classes today and wouldn't be coming to the lab.

She could have the break room all to herself.

Sophia stretched contentedly.

She lay down to enjoy her nap.

The four senior researchers—Zoe, Quincy, Simon, and Lillian—each had their own private break rooms.

Sophia joined later. With only five break rooms in the lab, there wasn't an extra one for her.

Fortunately, Alexander's break room was a suite, spacious enough.

She had bought a folding bed and placed it behind the door in the inner room.

It was hidden and dark, perfect for sleeping.

Usually, Alexander napped in the outer room.

They were separated by a wall and a door, each having their own private space.

It was Alexander who had initially suggested she use the inner room.

Sophia had confirmed it wouldn't cause any inconvenience. She truly needed a quiet space for her nap, so she agreed.

Zoe and Quincy had said, "The inner room is better. It's shaded, cooler, and darker."

Simon and Lillian had come to see it.

Simon said, "The Professor's break room is really big."

Lillian pursed her lips, her gaze sweeping over the folding bed. "It's alright…"

It was far enough from the outer room.

They each rested separately. Surely, Sophia wouldn't dare to have any improper thoughts.

…

Alexander had a full schedule of classes today and originally didn't plan to come to the lab.

He was eating lunch in the cafeteria when a student knocked over a bowl of soup.

He happened to be passing by. In the blink of an eye, his shirt was ruined.

Remembering he had a change of clothes in the lab break room, he decided to go over.

He planned to change quickly and leave. He still had classes in the afternoon.
###Chapter 164

Alexander Laurent pushed open the door to the break room.

The laboratory was silent.

He walked to the sink and carefully washed his hands.

Cold water rushed over his fingertips.

He cupped his hands, splashing water on his face.

Droplets trailed down his jawline.

The man walked toward the inner room.

Sophia Sullivan woke at the sound of the door.

The folding bed was tucked behind the door.

The door panel completely concealed her.

She opened her eyes.

Alexander was unbuttoning his shirt.

The fabric slipped away.

Revealing the well-defined muscles of his back.

Sophia held her breath.

Speaking now would be too awkward.

She decisively closed her eyes and pretended to sleep.

But the image of his taut skin was seared into her mind.

Alexander changed into a fresh shirt.

As he turned, he glimpsed the folding bed behind the door.

He paused.

Gently, he pulled the door open.

Sophia was curled up on the folding bed.

Her blanket had slipped to the floor.

He picked it up.

Carefully, he draped it back over her.

The girl's eyelashes fluttered slightly.

Her sleeping face was peaceful.

He watched for a moment.

Then abruptly looked away.

He quickly left the inner room.

The tips of his ears felt warm.

Sophia's tense nerves finally relaxed.

He had stayed too long.

She had almost broken character.

His scent still lingered on the blanket.

Clean and crisp, like cedarwood.

Voices drifted from outside the door.

"Alex? Don't you have a class today?"

"Came back to get something."

"Why is your face red?"

"The AC isn't on out here."

"No wonder... Have you seen Sophia?"

"No."

Footsteps faded away.

Sophia sat up.

Her cheeks were still warm.

That afternoon, back in the lab area.

Zoe Langley studied her curiously.

"Sophia, your face is so flushed."

Professor Quincy Evans chimed in. "No AC in the inner room either?"

Sophia gave a vague reply.

"Professor Laurent was all red earlier from the heat too."

Zoe laughed. "What's going on with you two?"

Sophia lowered her head, organizing data.

Her fingertips trembled slightly.

After work, she went grocery shopping.

Her phone screen lit up.

Her father's smiling face appeared on the video call.

"Tending to your plants again?"

"Your mother is busy writing."

Sophia picked up a bite of greens.

"The editor isn't giving her trouble anymore?"

"She blocked him."

David Sullivan sounded resigned.

"Completely cut off contact."

Sophia set down her chopsticks.

"Dad, keep a close eye on Mom lately."

"Don't let Editor Moore near her."

Outside the window, night deepened.

She remembered that 3 a.m. phone call.

The voice of the acclaimed editor, Stone Macmillan, was clear and calm.

"I've finished the manuscript."

"Arrange a meeting with your mother."
###Chapter 165

Sophia's fingertips turned cold.

Stone spoke with a heavy tone. "Your mother has been severely held back all these years."

A tightness gripped Sophia's chest.

Stone expressed his desire to speak with Isabella face-to-face.

Sophia explained softly that her mother was in a neighboring city.

Her contract with Editor Moore hadn't expired yet.

She didn't want to affect her mother's creative mindset prematurely.

Upon hearing "contract," Stone immediately requested an electronic copy.

"I need to study this contract first."

"Keep in touch."

"I'm signing your mother."

Sophia was stunned.

Stone only signed works, not people.

She must have misheard.

David, noticing his daughter's grave expression, set down the spatula.

"Mimi, what's wrong with Mom?"

"Minor issue. It's being handled."

"Please don't tell Mom yet. She gets affected easily."

"Okay, I'll be careful."

The video call ended.

Sophia finished cleaning the kitchen and went downstairs to take out the trash.

The early summer evening breeze was moist and gentle.

She took a solitary walk to aid digestion.

The sky gradually darkened.

Remembering the previous stalking incident, she hurried home.

After her shower, she sat at the desk.

She opened her thesis and began taking notes.

Her phone suddenly chimed.

A message from Sebastian.

[Still busy?]

Sophia replied, asking what he needed.

He responded instantly.

[Can't I just message you?]

Sophia hesitated.

Another message popped up.

[Is a phone call convenient?]

Sophia straightened up.

[Yes.]

The call connected.

Sebastian got straight to the point.

"They caught the creep who was stalking you."

"The evidence is solid. He's facing years in prison."

Sophia was surprised.

"How did you catch him?"

Sebastian chuckled lowly.

"If I want something done."

It gets done.

His tone was arrogant, yet matter-of-fact.

"Even though he's caught, you still need to be careful."

"Try not to go out late at night."

Sophia agreed softly.

"Understood."

She paused, then added.

"Thank you."

Sebastian sounded exasperated.

"Why is it always 'thank you'?"

Sophia mumbled under her breath.

"It's all I know how to say."

"You know how. You just don't want to."

"Then why ask?"

Sebastian laughed in frustration.

She was quite defiant.

Sophia yawned.

"Was there anything else?"

Drowsiness was setting in.

"Yes."

[?]

"About Professor Murphy. It's complicated over the phone. Let's discuss it in person tomorrow."

In person?

Sophia frowned.

"I have to go to the lab tomorrow…"

"I know. You must have a lunch break, right?"

"Is fifteen minutes enough?"

"Fifteen? That short?"

Sebastian shrugged.

"An hour or two would be better. I don't mind more time."

Sophia sighed.

"Fifteen minutes it is."

"See you tomorrow."

The call ended.

Sophia turned off the light and went to sleep.

She slept soundly through the night without any dreams.

She woke up early and made breakfast.

She also prepared lunch to take with her.

She arrived at the lab by seven-thirty.

There was movement in the break room.

Alexander walked out.

Their eyes met.

Both were momentarily stunned.

Alexander recalled his abrupt departure yesterday.

He looked slightly uncomfortable.

Sophia remembered pretending to sleep and the scene she'd accidentally witnessed.

She felt a bit awkward too.

"Morning," he spoke first.

Sophia nodded.

"Morning."

She quickly slipped to her lab station and buried herself in work.

She even forgot to put her lunch in the fridge.

Alexander reminded her gently.

"I'm heading to the break room. I can put it away for you."

Sophia's ears felt warm.

"Thank you, Professor."

Lunchtime arrived.

Sophia walked out of the Maxwell Dworkin Building.

Sebastian leaned casually against a tree.

His shirt collar was slightly open.

His suit pants accentuated his long legs.

He looked both lazy and debonair.

"Have you been waiting long?"

"Just got here."

"What about Professor Murphy?"

The man handed her a file folder.

"Professor Murphy asked me to create a reference answer key for the final exam."

"He's too lazy to grade. He'll have the master's students grade based on it."

The old man wasn't doing any work.

He pushed it all onto him.

The most outrageous part was—

"After I finished the problems, he said he wasn't confident and wants you to check them."

The questions were the ones he'd gotten from Sophia last time.

Benjamin Murphy was utterly unapologetic.

"Is there a problem with her checking them?"

Sebastian initially wanted to argue.

Then he suddenly changed his mind.

"You're right. Sophia is the most suitable person for this."

"You're so busy. I'll take it to her."

Benjamin was puzzled.

"There's an electronic version. Can't you just send it?"

"No."

[?]

"Face-to-face communication is more convenient."

"But… what needs to be communicated?"

Sebastian picked up the materials.

"I'll personally deliver it to her tomorrow."

He left cheerfully.

Benjamin was left full of questions.

The kid was being far too agreeable today.

Something was definitely up.

…

Hearing the explanation, Sophia's mouth twitched.

First, he freeloaded the questions.

Now, he wanted to freeload the answers.

Typical Professor Murphy.

Never missing an opportunity to get something for nothing.

She checked the time.

"Is the reference answer inside?"

"Yes."

"It'll take over ten minutes to review now."

"Okay, let's go to that pavilion. It's shaded."

Sophia was curious.

"Men are afraid of getting sun too?"

Sebastian nodded.

"Afraid."

In reality, they had only been standing for two minutes.

Sophia had looked up at the sky five times and frowned ten times.

Sebastian had noticed all these small mannerisms.

Alexander was returning from the cafeteria.

His steps suddenly halted.

His gaze shifted towards the pavilion across the way.
###Chapter 166

Sophia Sullivan and Sebastian Evans sat side by side at the stone table.

They were very close.

The girl was focused.
The man listened attentively, nodding occasionally.

Alexander Laurent watched from a distance.
He didn't miss that faint, almost imperceptible smile on Sebastian's lips.

Even from afar, he could sense the mating ritual.

His eyes darkened.

The next second, he took out his phone and called Quincy Evans.

"Alex? What's up?"

"Feel like getting bubble tea?"

"Huh?" Quincy moved the phone away and looked at the screen. "You okay? Why suddenly ask that?"

"My treat. You can ask the others."

Quincy immediately raised his voice—

"Professor Laurent is buying bubble tea! Raise your hand if you don't want any! Good, no one. So we all want some."

"I'll go buy it."

"Can't we just order delivery? Why go yourself?"

Alexander: "I'm already out. What flavors?"

"Which shop?"

Alexander named a store.

Quincy: "I want an Oreo milk tea, with fresh milk base, add taro balls, less sugar, no ice, extra cheese foam; Zoe wants…"

Alexander rubbed his temples: "Too complicated. Can't remember."

Quincy: "?"

Bullshit!

Professor Laurent, who never forgets anything, can't remember this?

Alexander: "Send your orders to Sophia Sullivan. I ran into her downstairs. We'll go buy it together."

"Okay! Sending it now!"

Quincy looked down and typed.

"Sent!"

He added a voice message: "Thanks, sweetie~"

Suddenly, he paused—

Wait.

Wouldn't it be easier to just send it directly to Alex?

Why go through all these hoops?

...

"Sophia Sullivan."

Both people in the pavilion looked up.

"Professor Laurent? What are you doing here?"

Alexander's expression was calm. "Just passing by."

Sebastian's smile faded. He stood up and extended his hand. "Professor Laurent. Good to see you again."

"Mr. Evans." Alexander shook his hand.

Their eyes met. One was detached. The other was languid.

The air suddenly grew tense.

"Mr. Evans is at the university today?" Alexander released his hand.

Sebastian: "Helping my professor with some matters."

Just then, Sophia received the message. She looked at Alexander in surprise—

"Professor, you're treating everyone to bubble tea?"

"Yes. The one you gave me last time was quite good. We'll go to that same shop today."

Alexander said the name of the shop.

Sophia nodded: "Okay, just give me a moment. I'll be quick."

"Alright."

The faint smile on Sebastian's lips froze completely.

Hearing the shop's name, his heart sank.

A suspicion surfaced in his mind—

"Professor Laurent drinks bubble tea too?"

"Didn't used to. Tried Sophia's. It was acceptable."

"Hot or iced?"

Alexander's lips curved. "Lukewarm."

"Anything special about the packaging?"

"The cup had a design of a Cupid's arrow piercing a heart. Their service is quite thoughtful."

Sebastian's anxiously waiting heart finally died.

It was indeed the one he bought for Sophia!

"All done." Sophia handed the notepad and pen back to Sebastian. "The reference answer was missing three details. I've added them in the margins. You can give this to Professor Murphy."

"I should get going now."

Sebastian forced a smile. "Okay. See you next time."

"Mm. Professor, let's go. That bubble tea shop is right across from our building."

She had been there last time when discussing things with Sebastian.

...

"The bubble tea is here!"

Zoe, Quincy, and Simon heard the news and came over.

"Thanks, Professor! Sorry for the trouble, Sophia!"

"Making two busy people run an errand for us is a sin!"

Quincy stuck in a straw and took a big sip. "Heaven~"

Zoe: "Is it really that good?"

Simon took his and Lillian's cups, thanking them with a smile.

Then he happily delivered Lillian's to her.

"Lil, your bubble tea."

"Oh."

Hearing that Sophia and Alexander went to buy bubble tea together, Lillian's mood instantly plummeted.

Simon was still chattering beside her—

"Lil, not going to drink it?"

"The cream cap will melt if you wait."

"Let me put the straw in for you."

Lillian couldn't take it anymore. "So annoying! Do you ever stop talking? Can you just be quiet for once?"

She stood up and left.

Simon scratched his head, looking at the untouched cup. "...You didn't say no when I asked."

Why refuse it now after it was bought?

What a waste.

Perhaps Simon would never understand.

This was an innate gap between them.

It had nothing to do with education or values.

It was a chasm carved by their upbringing and environment.

Lillian didn't refuse only because Alexander was the one treating.

She went to the hallway for some air.

Her phone suddenly rang. She answered—

"Hello."

"Old classmate, I found the apartment you wanted!"

"Really?" Lillian's eyes lit up.

"Took a lot of effort... The owners are an elderly couple. They weren't willing to rent initially, but their son's family ran into trouble and needed money urgently, so they agreed. It's just the price..."

"Money isn't an issue. Which unit?"

"Unit Three. First floor."

Alexander lived on the seventh floor of Unit One...

Too far away.

The light in Lillian's eyes instantly died. She replied flatly, "Any other units available?"

"...That's the only one right now. Rarely any rentals in this old complex. The other complex I recommended last time is pretty good too, I don't know why you..."

Just didn't like it.

"Miss, why don't you just tell me which unit you want to rent, and I'll go ask?"

Hah, renting an apartment was just an excuse. It was all about who she was after!

Lillian didn't detect the sarcasm. She thought seriously: "Can you look in Unit One? Fifth floor or above. Sixth floor would be best."

She originally wanted to say seventh floor, but Alexander and Sophia lived there.

The closest was the sixth floor.

The agent classmate laughed in disbelief. "Sure, I'll look for you." Yeah, right!

After hanging up, a voice suddenly came from behind—

"Lil, you're looking to rent?"

Lillian stiffened completely.

She turned around slowly.
Simon stood not far away, holding the bubble tea.

She had no idea how long he had been there, or how much he had overheard.
###Chapter 167

"Lillian?" Simon called out again.

"...What is it?"

"Were you just contacting an agent to rent an apartment?"

Lillian's heart tightened, afraid he would press further. Her tone turned sharp. "Why do you ask so many questions? It's none of your business!"

A flicker of hurt passed through Simon's eyes, but he remained gentle. "I'm your boyfriend. Of course I care about you."

"I wanted a boyfriend, not a father."

"If you think I'm being too nosy... I'll talk less from now on?"

He was cautious, afraid of upsetting her again.

Seeing he didn't press about the apartment, Lillian relaxed internally. Her attitude softened.

"Give it to me—" She reached out.

"What?"

"That bubble tea in your hand. Isn't it for me?"

"Oh right! I almost forgot..." Simon smiled.

…

Another week passed in the lab. Finally, both sets of data were ready.

The pressure finally eased up.

On Saturday, Sophia gave herself a day off.

"Miss Sullivan, long time no see. Did you almost forget what I look like?"

Olivia pulled up beside her in a convertible Ferrari.

She rested her arm on the window, took off her sunglasses, and revealed her sparkling, peach-blossom eyes.

The wind tousled her voluminous curls. She wore a black utility jumpsuit with a statement belt, looking trendy and cool.

Sophia got into the passenger seat and fastened her seatbelt. "How could I dare? I could forget anyone but my Queen Olivia."

Olivia pinched her dewy cheek. "Two weeks apart, and your mouth is so sweet. Did you sneak some honey?"

"No need to sneak. I'm naturally sweet."

"Yes, yes! You're sweet. Hold on tight. The queen is taking you for some good food!"

"Okay~"

"Clara, you're just too well-behaved. If I were a man, I'd marry you straight away!"

Then what use would that scumbag Ethan Roscente be?

Ugh! Bad luck!

Xigu Yuan, a recently popular Cantonese tea restaurant.

It had been rooted in Kyoto for years but recently went viral thanks to influencers. New customers flooded in, leaving regulars unable to get a table.

Olivia had made the reservation half a month in advance.

Roasted pigeon was their signature dish. Sophia ordered some appetizers first. The pigeon arrived after they finished those.

The skin was crispy without being greasy. A bite released juicy, tender, and springy meat.

Truly worthy of being the signature dish.

"This place has been in Kyoto for over twenty years. It was only famous among foodies until recently. These influencer visits blew its cover…"

Olivia first came here with her dad.

Thinking Sophia had been working hard on her experiments lately, and with the weather getting hotter, heavy, inflammatory foods wouldn't do. Light Cantonese cuisine was perfect!

"How's the taste? Good, right?"

Sophia nodded. "Mhm, delicious!"

The cooking was perfect, locking in the juices. The skin carried the smoky aroma of fruitwood charcoal.

Sophia even started pondering the recipe for the pigeon… She could try making it sometime.

She used to research recipes and cook mainly for Ethan.

After the breakup, she slowly discovered that cooking a good meal for herself or sharing food with friends was a joyful thing in itself.

Not to please anyone, nor to curry favor with anyone.

As long as she enjoyed it, whether it was cooking or anything else, it was pleasant.

"Clara… Thanks for last time. My brother said I made a scene while drunk?"

Mentioning that drunken episode, Olivia awkwardly rubbed her nose.

"It's all my mom's fault. She made me attend some 'young people's party.' It was clearly a matchmaking banquet."

Young men and women were lined up like goods on a chopping block, waiting to be chosen.

Nina White was great in many ways, just overly anxious.

She kept saying mismatched status leads to unhappiness, that experience proves love ultimately depends on economic foundation…

Olivia was fed up.

After last time, she made a three-point agreement with Ms. Bai. Matching status was fine, but she would pick the person herself.

In exchange, Nina White could no longer privately arrange matchmaking banquets or parties.

Sophia: "Pick yourself?"

"Right. As long as their family background isn't poor, my mom can accept it. Easy. I'll just pick from our circle!"

"You're really going to pick?"

Sophia blinked.

Olivia liked the "younger puppy" type. There were plenty of younger men in their circle… but ones who would dote on her, pamper her, treat her like a queen…

Were almost impossible to find.

With privileged backgrounds came natural arrogance. They're all from wealthy families; why should a man lower himself to pamper you?

Olivia coughed lightly, lowering her voice. "I have to pick, otherwise I can't交代 (explain myself). But I'm not picking a partner. I'm picking a合作对象 (collaboration partner)."

"Collaboration partner?"

"Yep. Many men and women in our circle are pressured into marriage. Since no one wants to follow family arrangements, we collaborate."

"How do you collaborate?"

"Put on a show in public, play the part. Behind the scenes, everyone does their own thing!"

This way, they can交代 (answer) to their families, avoid lectures, and use the cover to have fun outside. A win-win.

Sophia still advised her to think it through and not play with fire.

Olivia: "Don't worry. I know my limits."

When they were almost done eating, Sophia went to the restroom and paid the bill.

As they walked out, Olivia pouted. "I said it's my treat. Why did you secretly pay?"

Sophia: "I can't always let you pay. I'm not broke."

"Oh right. You're a little rich lady."

She reached out to pinch Sophia's cheek.

"Don't pinch, it hurts—We're in public. Less hands-on. It looks bad."

The two girls chatted and laughed, walking through the hall towards the exit.

"Professor Laurent, a moment please."

The words made them stop and instinctively look towards the source of the voice.

A group emerged from an upstairs private room. Mostly middle-aged, a few with graying hair. Almost all wore polo shirts and casual slacks.

They reeked of academia.

The young man at the center stood out.

He was tall and upright, with handsome, refined features.

He stood out like a crane among chickens amidst the portly, balding middle-aged men.

"Professor Laurent, I'll be counting on your endorsement for my new research proposal."

"Please also help with the experimental consumables I need to order."

"The project proposal from our lab, please give it your consideration…"

A crowd surrounded him, cupping hands and making requests, the scene was lively.

Alexander Laurent responded to each one, a trace of impatience already in his eyes. Suddenly, his gaze swept across the lower hall and landed on the two girls.

The next second, his brow smoothed.

"Apologies, everyone. My sister has arrived. She's right down there. I must take my leave. Goodbye."

Amidst their attempts to get him to stay, he strode purposefully towards Sophia and Olivia.
###Chapter 168

The three of them walked out of the restaurant.

The night breeze was gentle.

Olivia sniffed the air.

"Brother, have you been drinking?"

"Yes."

"Where's the car?"

"I didn't drive."

"Perfect. I'll take you both."

The car was parked at the mouth of the alley.

The alley was too narrow to enter.

Sophia Sullivan and Alexander Laurent got out.

Moonlight spilled onto the cobblestones.

The faint sound of a cat meowing could be heard.

Alexander's steps faltered slightly.

He had stepped on a bag of trash.

The alcohol hit him, and he swayed.

"Are you alright?"

"Sorry, had a bit too much."

He took half a step back.

Maintaining his distance.

Afraid the smell of alcohol would bother her.

Sophia was taken aback.

She thought of Ethan Roscente.

He often got drunk, but never apologized.

People really are different.

She used to think all men were like Ethan, Charlie Lowell, and Julian Winston.

Indulging in pleasure, playing the field.

Or like David Sullivan, plain and steady.

Until she met Alexander Laurent.

He stood at the top, yet was humble and composed.

True excellence doesn't need to show off.

Restraint is harder than indulgence.

"Even professors need to socialize for work?"

"It's a society of connections. Interactions are unavoidable."

"Alcohol is a medium. Tea, art, poetry, and books work too."

"Even children visiting relatives counts as socializing."

"Change the method to tea or fishing, and it doesn't feel like work socializing?"

"The essence remains the same."

Sophia blinked.

"Does tonight's dinner count as work socializing?"

Alexander chuckled softly.

"Yes, and no."

"Having my teacher and friends here was enjoyable."

"Unfamiliar people pushing drinks was tiresome."

"Half pleasure, half burden."

He turned to look at her.

His gaze was gentle.

"I hope you can experience it this way too."

Sophia's heart skipped a beat.

Before she could ask what he meant, they reached her door.

"Goodnight, Professor."

"See you tomorrow."

She lay in bed.

Remembering the way he spoke.

Powerful. Composed.

Do you need to stand that high to be so calm?

For the first time, she felt a yearning.

That emotion is called admiration for strength.

…

Olivia made a U-turn towards the bar.

As she parked, her car jolted violently.

Bang!

A Maserati had rear-ended her.

Olivia was furious.

She stormed out of the car.

"Are you blind? Don't you know how to drive?"

The car door opened.

Julian Winston stepped out with a smile.

"Well, if it isn't Miss Lopez."

"Small matter. Don't be angry."

He inspected the rear end.

It was a mess.

"Was going a bit too fast. Didn't notice."

Olivia rolled her eyes.

"Full responsibility. Fix the car."

"Since when does the Lopez family lack cars?"

"Save your breath."

She tossed him her keys.

Turned to leave.

Suddenly, a woman rushed out.

Slap!

A sharp crack echoed as her palm connected with Julian's face.

Olivia froze.

Julian licked the corner of his mouth.

"I don't hit women."

"Scum! You bastard!"

The woman was both crying and laughing.

She threw herself into his arms.

"Can't we not break up?"

"Not getting married is fine too…"

She wore a professional suit skirt.

Her makeup was impeccable.

But now she was hysterical and disheveled.

Julian remained unmoved.

"Not satisfied with the settlement?"

The woman stiffened.

Her eyes shifted from love to hatred.

"You don't understand love. You only know how to use money."

She wiped her tears.

Took a step back.

"One day, you'll meet someone money can't buy."

"You'll taste the bitterness of unrequited love."

"Tossing and turning, constantly on edge."

"Trampled on, just like I was."

"I curse you—to love but never obtain, to gain and then lose, to regret painfully for the rest of your life!"

"You don't deserve happiness."
###Chapter 169

The sharp click of high heels faded into the distance.

A mocking smile touched Julian Winston's lips.

The bitterness of love?

Ridiculous.

He never believed in such things.

The bar door swung open again.

A young girl in a pleated school-style skirt emerged.

Her curled hair cascaded over her shoulders.

Her makeup was flawless.

She looked like an expensive doll in a display case.

"Julian…"

She cooed, moving closer.

Julian sidestepped her advance.

His arm snaked out.

He pulled Olivia Lopez, who had been watching, into his embrace.

Olivia stumbled against his chest, caught off guard.

Julian lifted his eyes to the girl.

"Sorry."

"I'm taken."

The girl bit her lip, shooting Olivia a glare.

She turned and left, displeasure evident in her stride.

"Using me as a shield?"

Olivia scoffed coldly, pushing him away.

"Get your hand off."

Julian had been about to release her.

Now he changed his mind.

"No."

Olivia laughed in frustration.

"Fine."

Her hand shot out, twisting his wrist sharply.

Julian hissed in pain.

"Let go! You'll break it!"

Olivia raised an eyebrow.

"Still feeling cheeky?"

"No! I was wrong!"

She loosened her grip.

But then she placed his hand back on her own waist.

Julian was stunned.

Olivia spoke calmly.

"Now you can remove it."

Julian laughed, exasperated.

This woman was doing it on purpose.

It was downright insulting.

The bar door burst open.

A man stormed out, furious.

"Olivia Lopez! You're a full hour late!"

"I thought you'd been in an accident."

"Turns out you're just flirting with some random guy?"

His eyes landed on Julian's hand.

He let out a cold laugh.

"The deal's off."

"I don't do business with people who can't keep time."

He turned and left without another word.

Olivia smacked Julian's hand away.

"Want another lesson?"

Julian quickly withdrew his hand.

Olivia sighed, watching the man's retreating back.

A promising business contact.

Gone, just like that.

"This is your fault."

"Your driving is atrocious."

"Go back to driving school."

Julian stood quietly, accepting the scolding.

"Was that the youngest son of the Chen family?"

"What were you discussing with him?"

Olivia shot him a look.

"None of your business."

"I want to make it up to you."

"Anything he can offer, I can too."

Olivia gave him a strange, appraising look.

"You sure?"

"Absolutely."

Olivia studied him carefully.

The Winston family's influence far surpassed the Chens'.

He was emotionally stable.

Knew how to have fun.

Most importantly.

He was clean with breakups.

Perfect for her needs right now.

"Fine."

"Shall we talk inside?"

Julian raised an eyebrow.

"Let's talk."

A satisfied smile touched Olivia's lips.

She grabbed his tie and pulled him forward.

"Let's go."

Julian stumbled, pulled off balance by her force.

This woman was too rough.

...

Victoria Roscente had been in a funk for two days.

But she soon returned to her usual self.

Not having to cater to Isabella Langley's whims made her life much easier.

Today, the ladies had organized a high tea.

Exquisite floral teas.

Delicate pastries.

Victoria wore a new designer suit.

She sat on a plush leather sofa, enjoying the soft music.

"Mrs. Roscente, you're looking a bit pale."

Mrs. Lee spoke with a sugary smile.

"Trouble at home?"

Victoria's smile tightened.

"The heat is affecting my sleep."

Mrs. Lee pursed her lips.

"Poor sleep is one thing."

"A rotten heart is much harder to fix."

Victoria's grip tightened on her teacup.

She rose gracefully, smiling.

"It's stuffy in here. I need some air."

She exited the private room with poise.

Whispers followed her.

"Who does she think she's fooling?"

"Everyone knows about her family drama."

"That poor girl who miscarried."

"Some people bring it on themselves."

Victoria reached the main hall.

She was about to signal a server.

Suddenly, a commotion erupted at the reception desk.

"You can't go in without a reservation!"

"Screw the reservation! I'm here to see someone!"

"Step aside!"
###Chapter 170

Security! Stop them!

Deborah Melville dropped all pretense and shrieked.

"Where is Victoria Roscente? Tell Victoria Roscente to get out here!"

Deborah and her son Tyson Richter had arrived in Kyoto two days prior.

They first visited Isabella Langley in her hospital room.

Then…

They simply moved in.

Deborah declared, "Hotels are so expensive. This room is huge and comfortable. Best of all, it's free!"

"But there's only one bed. The two of you…"

"What does it matter between mother and son?"

Tyson picked his teeth and nodded. "Exactly! We sleep together at home too. Saves on electricity."

Their protests were ignored.

The pair truly settled into the hospital room.

The VIP suite allowed for family members to stay.

The account balance was more than sufficient.

The hospital did not interfere.

Isabella could remain long-term.

The guest bed was naturally available for use.

Deborah endured the smell of disinfectant for two days.

Not a single person from the man's family showed up.

Not even a nanny made an appearance.

"Do they think hiding will work? Dream on!"

"Mom, what should we do?" Tyson cracked his knuckles.

"If they won't come to us, we'll go to them!"

That morning, Isabella saw Victoria's party photos on social media.

The background was a private room at a hotel.

She had been there once with Victoria.

She immediately sent the address to Deborah.

Mother and son headed straight there.

Victoria had been watching the commotion from a distance.

She suddenly heard her own name.

She thought she misheard.

It came a second time.

She heard it clearly.

They were indeed calling for her.

Her heart sank.

She saw the front desk staff struggling to hold them back.

Victoria turned to retreat into the private room.

A server approached carrying a tray.

He called out from afar—

"Mrs. Roscente! Your water. Mrs. Roscente?"

She didn't respond.

The server raised his voice.

Roscente?

Deborah froze.

The man who got her daughter pregnant was named Roscente.

Her eyes narrowed with a sudden idea.

She suddenly shouted at the retreating figure, "Ethan Roscente!"

Victoria heard her son's name.

She immediately turned around.

"It is you!" Deborah had been waiting for this!

She shoved the staff aside.

She rushed over and grabbed Victoria's hair—

"Trying to run? No way!"

Victoria had never encountered a scene like this.

She was stunned on the spot.

Deborah yelled, "My daughter is half-dead in the hospital, and you're here enjoying yourself?"

"Dressed all fancy,disgusting—"

A glob of spit landed on Victoria's clothes.

Victoria was horrified.

"My daughter had a miscarriage and is hospitalized. You haven't shown any concern. Where's your conscience?"

"You change your tune faster than flipping a book! All sweet talk before, now you give us the cold shoulder. You should be on stage!"

The noise was tremendous.

All the society ladies from the private room came out to see the spectacle.

Victoria was disheveled.

A woman was grabbing her and screaming.

What a scandal!

The ladies exchanged looks.

Deborah, seeing the crowd, became even more energized. "Everyone, look! Her son got my daughter pregnant and won't take responsibility!"

"My daughter's life is ruined! She hides and avoids us? Thinks we have no one on our side?"

She rolled up her sleeves.

"Film this and post it online! Let everyone see what a cesspit the Roscente family is! What kind of person Victoria Roscente is! And that trash of a son!"

Tyson blocked the staff.

He cooperated with his mother by pulling out his phone and aiming it at Victoria.

He filmed while cursing, "Serves you right! The Roscentes are scum! Got her pregnant and won't own up!"

"If we're suffering, you won't get off easy either!"

Victoria frantically tried to cover her face.

She dodged and struggled.

It was utterly humiliating.

"Stop filming! Your daughter has no self-respect. What does that have to do with my son?"

"I've been more than good to her! She lost the baby herself! Let go! I'll call the police if you keep this up!"

Deborah planted her hands on her hips and sneered. "Go ahead! Let the police decide!"

"I'm just a country woman. I've got nothing to lose! Let's see if you high-society types care about your reputation!"

Victoria stiffened all over.

Those last words hit her fatal weakness.

"You won't leave until you give us an answer! Tyson, hold her!"

"You—how dare you—"

Tyson put away his phone with a sinister grin. "Just watch me—"

"Ah! Get away! Don't touch me!" Victoria screamed.

The driver arrived with security just in time.

They pulled Victoria free.

They shielded her into the car and drove away.

Tyson asked, "Mom, she got away. What now?"

Deborah narrowed her eyes and smirked. "The monk can run, but the temple can't. We'll head back for now."

"The hospital stinks. Can we change places?" Tyson complained about the disinfectant smell on his clothes.

"Changing costs money. Once we get the compensation, we can stay in five-star hotels as much as we want!"

"True," Tyson grinned, showing his teeth. "My sister sure knows how to pick them…"

That woman just now clearly had money.

…

There was an issue with the southern project.

Ethan Roscente had been on a business trip for a week.

He took work calls as usual.

His personal phone was on Do Not Disturb.

No one could get through.

Company matters had piled up.

They required his signature.

He finally returned.

The plane landed.

Ethan turned off Do Not Disturb mode.

In less than two minutes.

Victoria's call came through.

"Hello, Mom…"
###Chapter 171
Ethan's phone vibrated.

The screen displayed "Mother."

He swiped to answer.

Victoria's voice was shrill. "Where are you? Not answering for days! Don't you recognize your own mother anymore?"

Ethan's tone was flat. "Business trip. Busy."

"Come home now! Immediately! Don't call me Mom if you don't!"

The call ended.

Ethan frowned.

He drove back to the old mansion.

He heard the sound of shattering porcelain as soon as he reached the door.

He pushed the door open.

Victoria rushed at him.

She pointed a finger in his face. "What kind of woman did you find! Isabella's whole family are scoundrels! Her mother is a shrew! Vulgar and low-class!"

Ethan's expression remained blank.

Victoria grew more agitated. "I knew she was no good! You had to get involved with her! And got her pregnant! Now she's had a miscarriage and it's all our fault…"

Ethan cut in abruptly. "Miscarriage?"

"You didn't know?" Victoria was stunned.

Ethan's eyes darkened slightly.

He gave a faint, twisted smile.

That child was never meant to exist.

Good riddance.

Victoria took a deep breath. "Her mother caused a scene at my gathering today! Now everyone in our circle knows! If your father finds out…"

She shuddered at the thought of Julian.

Even after thirty years of marriage, she was still afraid.

"I never want to see anyone from the Langley family again! You deal with the mess you made!"

Victoria felt utterly disgusted.

She had showered three times but still felt dirty.

…

Sophia Sullivan lived a quiet life.

Her routine was the lab and home.

Data and papers kept her fulfilled.

She occasionally cooked a big meal.

She invited Olivia Lopez over to share it.

They took walks after dinner to buy fruit and beer.

They went home to watch shows and chat.

When tired, they lay in bed on their phones.

They shared secrets.

Olivia leaned in mysteriously. "Soph, I found one."

Sophia adjusted her pillow. "Found what?"

"A partner."

Sophia blinked.

Five seconds later, it clicked. "A boyfriend?"

"Fake!"

"Who? Do I know him?"

Olivia's eyes darted away. "Probably…"

Her phone suddenly rang.

She answered. "Got it. So annoying."

After hanging up, she started putting on her jacket. "Sorry, Soph. Something came up. I have to go."

Sophia nodded. "Drive safe."

Olivia walked out of the alley.

A flashy Maserati was parked by the curb.

Julian Winston tossed his cigarette butt.

He crushed it under his foot.

He strode over. "Too slow! I waited fifteen minutes!"

"You could have left if you didn't want to wait." Olivia pouted. "Is this how you ask for a favor?"

Julian took a deep breath.

He held back his anger.

This woman knew Taekwondo.

He couldn't win a fight.

He forced a smile. "It's an emergency! Can't you see I'm anxious, moving so slowly?"

"Get to the point." Olivia glanced at the car. "Got a cigarette?"

"Why?"

"Gimme one."

Julian was speechless.

He went back to the car for cigarettes and a lighter.

Olivia didn't take them.

She crossed her arms and looked at him.

Julian surrendered. "Am I finding a partner or a princess?"

He bent down to light her cigarette.

It was his first time lighting a cigarette for a woman.

His first time seeing someone look so good smoking.

"What's up?" Olivia blew a smoke ring.

The white haze blurred her features.

Julian said, "My mom heard we're dating. She insists on meeting you. Just gave me an ultimatum."

"We agreed to help each other out and mind our own business."

"I remember." Olivia nodded.

"I helped you with your mom. Now it's your turn to help me."

"Fine." Olivia agreed readily. "Just meeting the parents. I'll help you."

"Really?" Julian was skeptical.

"But there's a condition."

"See! What condition?"

"Lend me your car for two days." Olivia patted the hood.

Thump. Thump.

Julian winced. "Be gentle!"

"Deal or not?"

"Deal!" He tossed her the keys. "Only two days!"

Not a second more.

Olivia caught the keys. "Text me the time and place. Also, what kind of girl your mom likes. Hair length, style, clothes. Send it all."

"Is that necessary?"

"Of course." Olivia raised an eyebrow. "I'm very professional."

She finished her cigarette.

She stubbed it out on a lamppost.

Tossed it into a trash can.

The motion was fluid.

Julian stared, mesmerized.

"Come here." Olivia tilted her chin up.

"What for?" Julian stepped closer.

"Put your hand on my shoulder."

"Is that okay…" His hand was already on her shoulder.

Olivia's lip twitched. "What do you call me?"

"Olivia?"

"Wrong."

"Sweetheart?"

"Nope."

"Baby?"

"Disgusting!"

"Shrew!"

"Looking for a fight? Say it properly."

"Vivi—"

"That's more like it!"

Julian rubbed his nose. "Um… that wasn't me."

They turned around simultaneously.

Sophia stood at the mouth of the alley.

Holding her bag.

Her face was full of shock.
###Chapter 172
Damn!

Olivia Lopez sharply shrugged off the hand on her shoulder.

She straightened up, secretly relieved she'd tossed the cigarette butt in time.

Sophia Sullivan finally managed to close her gaping mouth.

"Um... Vivi, you forgot your bag..."

She really had just come to return the bag.

But then she saw Olivia with a man, their arms slung over each other's shoulders.

The man's back looked more and more familiar.

They turned around.

It was actually Julian Winston?

So...

This was the 'collaborator' Vivi mentioned?

Olivia stepped forward and took the bag.

"Thanks, Clara! Sorry to make you come all the way out so late."

"Head back now, it's not safe this late."

"I'll wait right here and watch you go upstairs."

"Wave from the balcony when you get in, then I'll leave."

"Okay."

Sophia turned and walked away.

She knew Olivia.

Carefree on the surface, but sharp underneath.

Between friends, silence was the ultimate respect.

Olivia stood her ground.

She waited until she saw Sophia wave from the balcony.

Only then did she turn away, reassured.

"Wait... you're taking my car and not giving me a ride?" Julian Winston caught up to her.

"We're not going the same way."

"..."

"Take a cab. It won't cost much," she suggested earnestly.

The engine roared.

She counted to three in her head.

Released the handbrake.

The car shot forward like an arrow.

His shouts were left behind.

"Olivia Lopez! Isn't your car fixed?"

"Why are you taking mine?"

"Drive carefully! I haven't even broken in my new car!"

His reluctant sacrifice led to an unexpected encounter on Financial Street the next day.

Julian Winston watched Olivia speed past in his Maserati.

Top down.

Her younger boyfriend in the passenger seat.

"Damn—"

Julian gritted his teeth on the spot.

Why did he feel a tinge of green on his head?

...

Late July.

Sophia's three theses were finally finalized.

Once all the data was in.

She revised them six times with Alexander Laurent's help.

After confirming everything was correct, she submitted them to three scientific journals.

Now, all she could do was wait for good news.

No more rushing to the lab at dawn.

No more prepping lunch in advance.

No more worrying about unfinished data during lunch breaks.

Time seemed to slow down in her newfound freedom.

She could leisurely stroll through the farmer's market.

Tend to her plants slowly.

Occasionally try new recipes.

Frequently video chat with her parents.

Calls often lasted half an hour.

David Sullivan asked, "All three are done?"

"Yes. Thanks to Professor Laurent lending me the lab, otherwise the data would have taken forever."

Without the data, the papers couldn't have been written.

"Such a sought-after resource, and the professor provided it for free. You should thank him properly."

Sophia later learned just how in-demand Alexander Laurent's lab was.

Many had tried to rent it before and were refused.

Yet he made an exception just for her.

No wonder the looks from Zhao, Qian, Sun, and Li were so strange at first.

The next day, Sophia went out for her morning run.

With free time, she had picked up the habit again.

A good sweat, a shower, and she felt energized all day.

"Morning, Professor."

"Morning."

Alexander had already finished his run and was heading back.

Seeing her, he changed direction.

"I'll join you for a bit."

"Won't that delay you getting to the lab?"

"Quincy is handling the new project. I'm not busy lately."

"Professor Evans might have something to say about that," Sophia joked.

"He'll have to work regardless," he said matter-of-factly.

Quincy Evans would probably lose it if he heard.

They ran two laps around the park.

Sophia gradually began to struggle.

Alexander reminded her, "Adjust your breathing. Find a rhythm."

"Follow me... In, out, in, out..."

Sophia followed his lead.

"Much better!"

"Want to keep going?"

"That's enough for today."

"Alright."

Not often they met like this, they had breakfast together before heading back.

"Any responses on the papers?"

Sophia shook her head. "Not yet."

"Normal. Top international journals have complex review processes. It takes time."

Bringing up the papers, Sophia seized the moment.

"Thank you for lending me the lab, Professor. I couldn't have finished without it."

"Offering rent seems tacky, but I feel bad not repaying you in some way."

"After thinking it over, how about I treat you to a meal?"

Alexander smiled and readily agreed.

"Sure. A free meal? I won't say no."

"What would you like? I'll..." book a restaurant.

Alexander interrupted, "Anything is fine. Your cooking is excellent."

Sophia: "??"

She hadn't said she was cooking.

But Alexander clearly assumed it.

Well...

Even though she didn't cook much in the heat, since he requested it.

"How about today at noon? Are you free?"

"Yes."

They chatted as they walked.

Reaching the alley entrance, Sophia suddenly stopped.

Alexander halted too. "What's wrong?"

Following her gaze.

Ethan Roscente stood outside the apartment building.

Black shirt paired with black suit pants.

The man stood under a tree, completely shrouded in the branches' shadows.

Light and shadow crisscrossed on him, fragmented and mottled.

"Clara..." Ethan stepped forward, his gaze hungrily lingering.

Fresh from her run, a faint sweat glistened on her forehead.

But her eyes were bright and clear, as if washed by water.

Her cheeks were flushed, full of vitality.

Ethan didn't look at Alexander beside her.

Not that he didn't notice, he just found him an eyesore.

But he couldn't make him leave, so he chose to ignore him.

"Is there something you need, Mr. Roscente?"

The address "Mr. Roscente" instantly created distance.

Ethan gave a bitter smile. "Between us, is such formality necessary?"

Sophia looked at him and slowly shook her head.

"We're not close."

"Can't we even be friends?"

"There's no need."

A qualified ex should be like the dead.

The so-called "let's be friends" is just one party's unwillingness to let go, and the other's lingering feelings.

But Sophia was neither.
###Chapter 173

She felt a deep calm.

He no longer easily swayed her emotions as he had right after the breakup.

Time was the best healer.

Even the deepest wounds would eventually scar over.

Sophia Sullivan had long since moved on.

Those past pains had gradually faded with time.

"What is it?" Sophia asked.

"Can we talk somewhere else?"

Sophia: "We have nothing to talk about."

"Clara…"

"Please use my full name."

Ethan Roscente looked at Alexander Laurent.

The other man showed no intention of leaving them alone.

Ethan pressed his lips together.

Sophia was afraid to be alone with him.

"Let's go," she said to Alexander.

Alexander gave a slight nod.

"You two are a 'we'? Then what does that make me?" Ethan's eyes reddened.

He was struggling to contain his anger.

His voice softened. "I don't accept that 'congratulations' you offered the other day."

I heard you're going to be a father. Congratulations…

Sophia frowned. "You…"

"If you won't forgive me, I will never have a child in this lifetime. Any child of mine can only be born from you."

Sophia: "…"

Alexander: "…"

They both fell silent simultaneously.

What kind of absurd statement was that?

Sophia: "You should go see a doctor."

Ethan: "?"

"Get treated for your illness early."

She took Alexander's hand and quickly walked away.

She only breathed a sigh of relief once they entered the apartment building.

"Sorry, Professor. That was embarrassing."

It was the first time Sophia felt genuine shame over an ex.

Alexander was silent for a moment.

"You've… been through a lot."

"…"

Sophia finished her shower and got dressed.

She checked the balcony to confirm no one was downstairs before grabbing her shopping bag to leave.

She was treating Alexander to lunch and needed fresh ingredients from the market.

"Professor?" She spotted a familiar figure at the mouth of the alley.

"What are you doing here?"

The man had just showered; his hair was still damp.

"Weren't you going shopping? I'll join you."

Sophia paused, then understood he was worried about her.

"Thank you."

Alexander smiled. "Let's go."

"Okay."

…

By ten in the morning, they had returned with the groceries.

Sophia carefully cleaned the sea bass.

She removed the congealed blood from the bone crevices.

She soaked it in scallion and ginger water to remove the fishy smell.

She planned to make salt and pepper spot prawns.

With the two main dishes prepared,

only the side dishes and soup remained.

Alexander rolled up his sleeves and helped wash and chop vegetables.

His movements were efficient and neat.

Sophia smiled and tried to stop him. "I can't let a guest work in the kitchen."

"This guest is happy to help."

The prep work went much faster.

Sophia fished out the sea bass and patted it dry.

She coated it with cooking oil to seal in the freshness.

Alexander stood nearby. "Need any help?"

"Could you grab the steaming rack for me?"

"Sure."

He reached for the rack above her head.

The motion briefly enveloped her within the space of his arms.

It was done quickly, without any awkwardness.

"I'll take it," Sophia said, reaching out.

Alexander handed it over.

Their fingertips brushed accidentally.

The man's breath hitched slightly.

Sophia didn't notice, taking the rack to steam the fish.

"Anything else?" Alexander withdrew his hand.

Sophia glanced at the counter. "Everything's prepped. You can wait outside."

The kitchen suddenly felt much more spacious.

The air seemed to cool down a little.

Twenty minutes later—

Sophia turned off the heat, took off her apron, and started bringing dishes to the table.

Alexander had already set out the bowls and chopsticks.

"The soup is still in the kitchen. I'll get it," he offered, heading towards the kitchen.

Sophia opened the fridge and took out two cans of beer.

She turned and met the man's gaze.

She felt inexplicably guilty.

"I bought these with Olivia the other day. Would you like one, Professor?"

She immediately felt strange. Why did she feel guilty?

Amusement flickered in Alexander's eyes. "I have to go to the lab this afternoon. I'll pass."

"Then I…"

Alexander looked at her quietly.

Sophia swallowed. "…probably shouldn't either?"

"Mm. Come eat."

Sophia obediently put the beer back in the fridge.

They sat down.

Sophia suddenly stood up, looking at Alexander seriously.

"Professor, thank you for all your help recently. Without the lab, I might still be doubting myself."

"Let me propose a toast to you with soup instead of wine."

She had originally intended to use beer, but now soup would have to do.

"I merely provided the space. You completed the experiments and data analysis yourself."

He didn't claim any credit.

Sophia understood the importance of the lab access.

He truly trusted her.
###Chapter 174

Sophia Sullivan pulled out a chair and sat down.

Alexander Laurent glanced up at her. "No need to be so formal."

He picked up his soup bowl and gently tapped it against hers.

The fried chicken wings were golden and crispy, perfectly cooked on the outside and tender inside.

He took a bite. The juices burst forth.

"You can't find this flavor anywhere else."

Sophia's eyes curved into happy crescents. "Should I give them all to you?"

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "Sure."

It was already two o'clock after the meal.

They cleaned up the kitchen together.

Alexander was heading to the lab.

Sophia planned to go to the library.

They walked together for a while.

At the fork in the road, Alexander turned left.

Sophia instinctively followed him for a few steps.

She suddenly stopped.

There was no need to go to the lab anymore.

Alexander chuckled softly.

The tips of Sophia's ears turned pink. She hurried off toward the library.

...

The next day, Sophia went to the lab.

She brought cupcakes she had baked herself.

Zoe Langley opened the box and gasped.

"Sophia, you made these? They're exquisite."

"I can't bear to eat them."

"The Hello Kitty and Jerry ones are so cute!"

Simon Lowell leaned over to look.

He noticed the Stellalou pattern.

"Can I have this one?"

Sophia nodded in agreement.

Zoe smiled knowingly. "For Lillian, right?"

Simon scratched his head, slightly embarrassed.

Quincy Evans had already started eating.

"The sweetness is perfect, not cloying at all."

He usually disliked sweets, but he finished the whole cupcake.

Sophia set down the paper box.

"My thesis is finished. I won't be coming to the lab anymore."

Zoe had expected this, just not so soon.

Quincy was a bit reluctant to see her go.

It was rare to find someone to discuss mental math with.

Simon smiled, trying to lighten the mood.

"We can still meet for meals later."

Sophia softly agreed.

Lillian Lopez glanced at the cupcakes on the table and pursed her lips.

Finally, she's leaving.

...

That evening, Alexander treated everyone to dinner.

They chose a five-star Michelin restaurant.

It featured a Chinese-inspired courtyard design with a charming small bridge over flowing water.

Sophia wore a lilac-purple maxi dress.

Her hair was tied up in a neat bun, looking fresh and tidy.

She paired it with a pair of slim-heeled sandals.

The cobblestone path at the entrance was a bit slippery.

Her foot slipped, and she started to fall backward.

Alexander quickly steadied her by the waist.

He let go once she was balanced.

"Be careful."

Sophia's ears flushed red. "Thank you."

She lifted the hem of her dress and walked more carefully.

Quincy offered his arm.

"Hold onto me. I promise you won't fall."

Lillian stared at Sophia's waist, her expression darkening.

During the meal, Simon noticed Lillian wasn't eating.

"Upset stomach? These dishes are all quite mild."

He placed a piece of fish on her plate.

Lillian pushed his hand away.

"Leave me alone."

Simon paused. "I was just worried about you..."

The others were used to this and continued their meals.

Alexander gave Simon a cool glance.

Sophia was focused on enjoying the exquisite food.

The five-star Michelin lived up to its reputation.

...

After that, Sophia never went back to the lab.

On a weekend afternoon, she received a call from her father.

"Sweetie, fantastic news!"

Sophia played along. "What's the good news?"

"Our old house is being demolished! The compensation is over a million!"

Sophia feigned surprise. "That much?"

"Good thing we never sold the old place. Remember our neighbor, Auntie Linda Moore?"

Of course Sophia remembered.

Linda Moore had destroyed the wisteria in the yard.

"What about her?"

David Sullivan's tone was gleeful.

"She listened to some agent's smooth talk and sold her house cheap."

"The very next day, the demolition news broke."

Linda Moore was filled with regret.

She dug out the sales contract and suddenly noticed—

The buyer's name was exactly the same as the agent's.

The agent had handled all the paperwork back then.

She never paid attention to the contract details.

The agent had bought her soon-to-be-demolished property at a low price.

Linda Moore was so angry she nearly fainted.
###Chapter 175

Linda Moore was never one to back down from a fight.

She couldn't swallow this injustice.

She stormed into the real estate agency that very day.

She was determined to confront that agent, Omelas.

The manager informed her that Mr. Semona had resigned three days prior.

With no one to confront, Linda fixated her anger on the agency itself.

She returned to cause a scene every single day.

She even enlisted relatives to hold protest signs outside the shop.

The situation escalated rapidly.

Finally, the manager, out of options, gave her Mr. Semona's home address.

Linda went straight to the address.

She successfully cornered him at his apartment.

To her surprise, he showed no guilt whatsoever.

He was completely unapologetic.

"You sold me the house. The payment cleared, and the deed is in my name now. Your protests are pointless."

Linda dropped to the floor in a fit of hysterics.

She employed her most dramatic performance.

Mr. Semona proved to be just as ruthless.

He mimicked her, lying down on the floor himself.

He began loudly proclaiming his innocence.

The neighbors, disturbed by the noise, called the police.

Both were taken to the police station.

After mediation, it was confirmed the house sale was final.

The contract was signed, payment received, and the title transferred.

No amount of fussing would return the property to Linda.

Mr. Semona sneered. "You were desperate to sell. I did you a favor buying your old place. Was that wrong?"

"Who could have predicted the demolition? I'm no fortune teller. You just have bad luck, missing out."

"Make all the noise you want. I'm unemployed now. I have all the time in the world. Let's see who lasts longer."

"The compensation money supports me. I don't need a job. But you? You have a husband and son. Don't you have housework to do?"

Linda was utterly dumbfounded.

She had dominated her faculty housing community for over a decade.

Everyone tolerated her out of respect for her husband.

But outsiders weren't obligated to play along.

Linda was consumed by regret.

If she had known about the demolition, why would she have sold?

Waiting just another month or two would have netted her one or two million!

The thought made her sick with anger.

Not a hundred dollars, but a million!

Just thrown away like that?!

David Sullivan added, "I heard she was so angry she ended up in the hospital."

Sophia Sullivan was speechless.

"By the way, she called your mother a couple days ago."

"Who did?"

David said, "Linda Moore."

"What did she want?"

"She asked if we'd sell our old house. Said she'd offer four hundred thousand, as a neighborly gesture."

Sophia's mouth twitched. "Is she out of her mind?"

The demolition policy was announced. Waiting a few months would yield over a million. Selling now for four hundred thousand?

David shrugged. "Maybe... she thought we hadn't heard about the demolition?"

Sophia was exasperated. "Ignore her."

"Your mother didn't. She hung up on her."

Linda tried calling several more times.

When Isabella refused to answer, she finally gave up.

Sophia, remembering Stone Macmillan's invitation and her mother's expiring contract, asked, "Dad, your summer break has started, right?"

"About a week ago. Why?"

"How about you and Mom come to Kyoto for a visit? You can see me?"

David was tempted.

He missed his daughter and fondly remembered his own university days in Kyoto.

"But aren't you working on your thesis? Would we be a distraction?"

"The thesis is done. I'm free lately."

"But it's the hottest time of year. Traveling might be..."

Isabella cut in, "Don't listen to your father. He's dying to go."

David coughed lightly. "I didn't say I wouldn't go."

Sophia laughed. "Great! I'll book your tickets right now."

She hung up and immediately booked two business class seats.

...

David and Isabella received the booking confirmation. The train was for the next day!

They hurried to pack.

"This girl, such a rush... Business class for a few hours? Such a waste of money..." David muttered while packing.

Isabella disagreed. "She wants to see us quickly. A few hours isn't short. Coach seats are painful. Don't you ache? She's being thoughtful, wanting us to be comfortable."

"Our daughter paid for the best seats herself, and you're complaining? Don't be ungrateful."

David clicked his tongue. "Look at you, one word from me, ten from you. I'm not complaining. I just want to save her some money..."

"Save your own money, not mine. 'Travel rich, live poor.' It's fine to be frugal normally, but when traveling, enjoy the comfort."

"Yes, yes, you're right, dear!" David nodded immediately, his attitude perfectly corrected.

While packing, Isabella brought daily necessities and changes of clothes.

David wanted to bring vegetables he'd grown himself.

Organic, pesticide-free.

Isabella was speechless as he tried to pack freshly dug potatoes. "That's enough. What if they spoil on the way?"

"Such a heavy suitcase. Can you even carry it?" Isabella asked, arms crossed skeptically.

"Of course I can carry it. It's not that much..." David tried lifting it, then...

"Well... it is a bit heavy, isn't it?"

Isabella: "..."

"Should I take some things out?"

The suitcase was eventually lightened considerably, much to Isabella's satisfaction.

...

The next evening, Sophia met her parents at the high-speed rail station.

Isabella recounted the previous night's packing antics.

Mother and daughter laughed together.

David followed behind them, scowling.

"Mom, Dad, my place is just ahead."

Sophia had already told them about her rental.

Isabella had been worried about safety and the environment.

Sophia hadn't hidden anything, explaining both the pros and cons clearly.

"...No elevator, the building's old, but the transportation is convenient. The subway and shopping district are right outside the alley. It's close to the universities."

David and Isabella listened as they walked,climbing seven flights of stairs.

Sophia took out her keys.

Suddenly, the door across from hers opened.

Alexander Laurent was home to grab a change of clothes before returning to the lab.

He froze upon opening the door and seeing Sophia with a man and a woman.

David and Isabella also stopped in their tracks, equally surprised.
###Chapter 176

Alexander Laurent quickly deduced their identities from their ages and appearances.

He stepped forward with a smile to greet them.

"Hello, Uncle, Auntie. I'm Alexander Laurent, Sophia's neighbor."

Sophia Sullivan snapped out of her thoughts and hurriedly made introductions.

"Mom, Dad, this is Professor Laurent. He's the one who lent me his lab."

David Sullivan's expression cleared with understanding.

"I didn't expect the professor to be so young. Truly accomplished for your age."

Isabella Sullivan was also slightly surprised, then smiled.

"Thank you for looking after our Sophia these past few days."

"Please, you're too kind. Just call me Alexander or Alex."

Alex?

Was he putting himself on the same generational level as Sophia?

"Hmm? What's this…" David noticed the object with a kraft paper cover in Alexander's hand.

It looked like a book, but not quite.

Alexander explained, "This is a 'desk calendar notebook' I borrowed from Professor Qin in the physics department at Caltech."

Worried David might not understand, he elaborated.

"It's a tradition in Caltech's physics department. Each professor has their top student compile excerpt notes based on hot research topics."

"Though only excerpts are required, students usually include their own analysis of research trends. It's passed down every four years, from one graduating student to the next."

"Professor Qin had his students' notes bound by year, like a desk calendar. Hence the name."

Alexander tried to explain in plain language, but it still sounded somewhat technical.

David looked a bit dazed.

He didn't seem to fully grasp it.

"My apologies," Alexander said. "Was my explanation too complicated?"

Suddenly, Isabella turned to David.

"Wasn't your respected mentor also named Qin? Qin something-wind?"

Alexander looked slightly surprised. "Qin Yufeng?"

"Yes, yes! Qin Yufeng!"

Alexander was even more astonished. "Uncle, you graduated from Caltech's physics department?"

David scratched the back of his head, somewhat embarrassed.

"Ah, it's rather shameful. Most of Professor Qin's students became leaders in research fields. Only I... didn't live up to expectations..."

Back then, his mentor had reserved a direct Ph.D. spot for him.

But he wanted to return to his hometown to be near his parents, so he declined the offer.

They hadn't seen each other since.

"How is Professor Qin's health?"

Alexander replied, "Hale and hearty."

David nodded.

"He was always full of energy. It's good that he's healthy. That's what matters. Alex, are you also from Caltech's physics department?"

Alexander said, "I studied physics, but I went to MIT."

David's eyes lit up.

"Physics is good. Exploring the infinite mysteries. Which specific field do you research..."

"Alright," Isabella quickly cut him off. "The professor needs to go out. Must you go on and on?"

David also noticed the bag in Alexander's hand.

"My apologies. I get carried away once I start talking. Please, don't let us keep you."

"It's no trouble at all. Chatting with you both has been a pleasure. You've just arrived today, so I won't intrude further. We can talk more once you've settled in."

David quickly nodded.

"Of course, of course. We'll talk later."

Alexander gave a slight nod and turned to leave.

Once inside the apartment, Sophia busied herself with the luggage.

Isabella and David began to look around their daughter's place.

Two bedrooms, one living room. Not too big, not too small.

Though the basic structure was old, the soft furnishings were carefully chosen.

The sofa, cabinets, and appliances were all quite new.

Some flaws were cleverly concealed with decorations and ornaments.

At first glance, it looked like a cozy, well-appointed apartment.

Seeing the dirty, messy stairwell had lowered their expectations for their daughter's living conditions.

But inside, it was a different world.

Isabella was very pleased.

Not just because the apartment was nicely decorated, but because of her daughter's attentiveness to life.

In her view, life could be make-do, but one's attitude toward life should not be.

When she and David first married, his monthly salary was meager, with most going to his parents.

They only had a small amount to live on.

After Sophia was born, finances were even tighter.

But Isabella still bought a bouquet of flowers every fortnight.

If they had money, she bought nicer ones. If not, she picked wildflowers for a vase.

Sophia always thought her mother was a bit bourgeois.

Her occasional "extravagance" didn't seem to fit an ordinary family background.

But whenever asked about her past, Isabella always said she'd forgotten.

Sophia suspected her mother came from a well-to-do family.

David thought so too, which was why he never restricted Isabella's spending.

He often said—

"Your mother suffered following me. I used up all my luck the day I saved her from the river."

So whenever something unlucky happened, he accepted it cheerfully.

David: "You know the first law of thermodynamics, right? Conservation of energy. Meeting your mom was energy +. Life's difficulties are energy -."

"Because I got such a huge + all at once, the - has to come slowly over time."

Back then, Sophia had just started in physics competitions.

She drew two conclusions from this.

Dad thought he wasn't unlucky enough (too little -).
It was okay to be unlucky for a lifetime (take it slow).
David: "..."

Isabella: "Hahaha..."

"Dad, Mom, don't just stand there. Sit down, rest for a bit, have some water..."

After putting away the luggage, Sophia went to the kitchen to make lemon tea.

"Sophia," Isabella took a sip of tea and suddenly asked, "Is Professor Laurent married?"

"Probably not."

"Does he have a girlfriend?"

Sophia paused, amused and exasperated.

"Mom, since when are you so nosy?"

"Just asking. With his qualifications, there must be no shortage of girls around him, right?"

Sophia thought about it seriously.

"Well, since I moved in, I haven't seen any girls around him."

Isabella looked thoughtful.
###Chapter 177

David Sullivan set down his teacup.
"Are you conducting a census here?"
"Besides, Sophia probably doesn't know much about his private affairs."
"What's the point of asking her?"
"Next time, just ask Alexander directly."

Isabella Sullivan actually nodded.
"Alright, I'll ask him directly next time I have the chance."

"Wait... you're actually serious?" David's eyes widened in surprise.

Isabella rolled her eyes.
"Sophia, do you have any rock sugar?"

"Yes, I'll get it." Sophia Sullivan stood up and walked toward the kitchen.

Seeing her daughter leave, Isabella lowered her voice and spoke to David.
"Sophia lives alone most of the time."
"And this Professor Laurent is her neighbor right across the hall."
"Plus, they seem to get along quite well."
"Shouldn't I find out more about him?"

"That makes sense." David scratched his head.
"My wife is always so thoughtful, hehe..."

Isabella shot him a look.
"Don't scoot over."
"What will our daughter think if she sees us like this?"

"Ahem!" David immediately sat up straight.
"I'll be more careful!"

The room had been prepared long ago.
Sophia had even bought a new bed for her parents.
The bedsheets and duvet covers were also newly purchased.
She had washed them, sun-dried them, and then made the bed.

"Mom, Dad, you should rest for a bit and take a nap."
"I'll take you out to explore later."
"You've been to Kyoto a few times but never really had the chance to properly sightsee."
"We'll make up for it all this time."

David and Isabella had visited Kyoto before.
During her four years of university, they had come to see her three times.
The first time was for freshman orientation, to help her move in.
The second time was when they heard she had a boyfriend.
Worried, they took advantage of David's summer break to make a trip.
They wanted to meet Ethan Roscente.
They stayed for three days.
Sophia accompanied them for the first two days.
Ethan only appeared on the third day.
After a hurried meal, he excused himself, saying he had things to do, and left.
The third time was for Sophia's graduation ceremony.
They came joyfully to witness this important moment in their daughter's life.
But they learned from others that she had actively given up her combined Master's and Ph.D. program.
To pursue some ridiculous notion of love?
David was deeply disappointed in his daughter.
Isabella also found it incomprehensible.
It ended tragically with "cutting ties and ceasing contact."
The first two visits were not happy memories.
Hopefully, everything would go smoothly this time...

While her parents rested, Sophia went to the market and bought fresh meat, vegetables, and fruit.
All were things Isabella and David loved.
As for towels and slippers, she had prepared those in advance.
After preparing dinner, Sophia went to wake her parents.
Isabella raised an eyebrow at the sight of the full table.
"Not bad. You've really inherited my skills."

David muttered under his breath.
"Clearly inherited from me, how did it become you..."

Isabella pretended not to hear, knowing he wouldn't dare say it aloud.
Sophia handed them chopsticks and sat down.
"Shall we eat?"

Isabella was already eager to start.
David took a few bites and nodded repeatedly.
"My daughter's cooking talent definitely comes from me..."

Isabella couldn't even be bothered to respond.

...

After dinner, the family went for a walk at MIT.
It was evening, the sun was setting, and fiery clouds drifted across the sky.
Interwoven shades of orange-red and brilliant gold created a scene as beautiful as an oil painting.
It was summer break, but there were still quite a few students coming and going on campus.
Sophia led her parents through the tree-lined avenue.
They passed the North Gate and arrived at the library.
The sight of so many books made David stop in his tracks.
In the end, Isabella had to pull him away, reluctant and looking back every few steps.
Back home, David was still preoccupied.
He had never been to the MIT library before.
He did his undergraduate degree at a different university in his youth.
A kid from the countryside, sensitive and insecure.
Every day was just studying and sleeping.
Where would he find the time or spare money to go out and explore?
Before bed, he said to Isabella.
"Come with me to check it out another day?"

Isabella knew his bookworm itch was acting up and agreed immediately.
"Sweetie, you're the best~"

"Stop it... time to sleep."
"...Oh."

It turned out that resting early and conserving energy was the right thing to do.
Because the next day, Sophia took them to the Great Wall.
It was another clear, sunny day.
They started early, so it wasn't too hot when they arrived.
David stood on the ramparts, looking down.
The mountains and rivers were magnificent and imposing.
But Isabella seemed lost in thought.

"What's wrong, Mom?" Sophia noticed her staring fixedly at a spot, as if entranced.

Isabella: "Is that the North 8 Tower over there?"
"Yes."
"It's also called the Sunrise Viewing Tower, the highest watchtower on the Badaling section."
"The 'He who has never been to the Great Wall is not a true man' stele is there?"
"Mmhmm," Sophia nodded vigorously.
"Mom, you actually researched this trip?"

Isabella was a very spontaneous person.
She never planned her trips.
She could sit and enjoy the scenery anywhere.
This time, she actually prepared in advance?
No wonder Sophia was surprised.
Isabella smiled, neither confirming nor denying.
A faint trace of confusion flickered in her eyes.
In fact, she hadn't done any research before coming.
She hadn't even looked up information about this section of the Great Wall.
Yet this information popped into her head the moment she saw it.
Perhaps, in the memories she had lost, she had been here before?

David started out full of ambition.
But after taking a photo at the stele, he was completely done—
"I can't do it, I can't do it. I'm tired and hot. Let's rest before going on."

Isabella teased him.
"Who was it that confidently claimed they'd be fine yesterday?"
"And now? We've barely started, and you're already giving up?"

David said righteously.
"I'm not young anymore."
"I've climbed for this long before needing a break."
"Look at those young people turning back halfway. They're not as good as me!"

On the seemingly endless stairs below them.
Quite a few young people were indeed starting to head back.
Isabella: ""
Fine, she couldn't win this argument.

Watching her parents bicker, Sophia couldn't help but laugh.
She was caught mid-laugh by Isabella.
"Laughing so happily? Are you and your dad ganging up on me?"

David also winked at her.
Meaning: That's right, us two are a team~

Sophia: "Dad, Mom, how about a photo together?"
"Great! Great!" David had been sitting.
Hearing this, he immediately stood up and started straightening his clothes.

Isabella chuckled fondly.
"Quite the peacock."
"Of course! Can't be too sloppy standing next to my wife."
"Sweetie, how do I look?"

Sophia played along, giving a thumbs up.
"Handsome!"
"Ready?"
"One, two—"

David: "Wait a second!"
He just realized his hat was crooked.
He tried to adjust it, but it seemed stuck.
Seeing his fluster, Isabella reached out and fixed it for him, her expression fondly exasperated.
She was wearing a short-sleeved red chiffon dress today.
The fitted fabric outlined her slender, graceful waist.
Her long hair was pinned up at the back, secured with a hairpin.
She looked exquisite and beautiful.
David wasn't nearly as particular.
He was dressed casually. Though past fifty, his features were regular, and he had a tall, straight nose.
Sophia's "handsome" wasn't just empty praise.
They stood facing each other.
Isabella was examining his hat: There, all straight.
David was gazing intently at Isabella, a smile playing on his lips: Mm, my wife is so beautiful.
Sophia pressed the shutter, capturing this moment.

That night, the exhausted family of three slept soundly and deeply.
Sophia woke up early the next morning.
She made breakfast.
Then she told her parents she needed to visit Professor Eleanor Watson's house before leaving.
However, when she returned in the afternoon, she found an extra person at home—
"Professor?!"
Sophia Sullivan pushed the door open.
###Chapter 178

She froze in place.

Alexander Laurent was actually in her house.

He was sitting on the living room sofa with David Sullivan.

A chessboard was set between them.

The game was in full swing.

David frowned deeply.

Alexander appeared completely at ease.

That familiar desk calendar notebook lay open beside him.

"Is that Sophia?" David looked up.

Alexander's gaze followed.

Amusement flickered in his eyes. "Surprised?"

Sophia changed her shoes and entered. "Professor, you didn't go to the lab today?"

David answered first. "We ran into each other in the elevator this morning after I bought groceries."

He had chatted with Alexander for a bit.

Unexpectedly, they found they had much in common.

He simply invited him home for a game of chess.

David sighed appreciatively. "Alexander even knows the intricacies of growing roses."

Alexander replied modestly, "Just a passing knowledge."

The conversation later turned to physics.

David mentioned several cutting-edge research topics.

Alexander was somewhat surprised.

These topics had only recently emerged.

Yet David discussed them with great familiarity.

He could even describe the specific experimental methods from a particular paper.

Alexander couldn't help asking, "Do you often read research papers?"

"A couple a day. It's a form of leisure for me."

Alexander opened the desk calendar notebook.

Sure enough, he found David's predictions from years ago.

Sophia raised an eyebrow. "Dad, you understand this stuff?"

David waved a hand dismissively. "Just idle speculation."

Alexander said earnestly, "Your father is quite remarkable, Sophia."

Sophia looked at her father.

David cleared his throat softly. "That was so many years ago."

A thoughtful look crossed Alexander's eyes.

He finally understood where Sophia's talent came from.

The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

After Sophia returned, Alexander took his leave appropriately.

David saw him to the door.

He came back still praising him. "Alexander is truly impressive."

Isabella teased him gently. "How many times have you said that now?"

Sophia joked, "Dad, you were practically gazing at him with adoration."

David glared. "Nonsense! My heart belongs only to your mother!"

Sophia clutched her chest.

The sudden display of affection was unexpected.

The next day, the family of three visited The Louvre Museum.

Sophia had booked the tickets in advance.

Isabella changed into ornate royal robes for photos.

The photographer praised her repeatedly. "Your aura is absolutely perfect!"

The developed photos were indeed stunning.

That night, Sophia slept in her mother's room.

She fell into a deep sleep surrounded by the familiar scent.

She checked her email in the morning.

A reply from the journal requested additional references.

Sophia decided to go to the library.

"I'll be back by noon," she said.

The weather was clear when she left.

In less than two hours, the sky changed dramatically.

Dark clouds gathered overhead.

Isabella grew worried. "It's going to rain. Sophia didn't bring an umbrella."

David stood up immediately. "Let's go pick her up."

They ran into Alexander Laurent just as they stepped out.

"Going out, Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan?"

"We're taking an umbrella to Sophia at the library."

Alexander glanced up at the sky.

Thunder rumbled in the distance.

"The library's layout is complex. I can show you the way."

David declined politely. "We couldn't trouble you."

Alexander said naturally, "It's no trouble. I need to stop by the lab to pick up some materials anyway."

The three of them set off together.

Raindrops began to fall.
###Chapter 179

A Man with Plans is Different

Signposts appeared every fifty meters.
They pointed the way to the library.
Alexander Laurent explained as they walked.
The North Campus was one big loop.
Maxwell Dworkin Building was to the left.
The library was to the right…

Sophia Sullivan listened intently.
She tried to map the route in her mind.

The three of them were talking.
Sophia came up the stairs.
They ran right into each other.

"Mom? Dad? Are you going out?"
"It looks like it's about to rain…"

Her gaze shifted.
She saw Alexander was also there.
"Professor? What's this about?"

Isabella Sullivan gave a brief explanation.
Sophia immediately thanked Alexander.

The man just waved a hand.
"Don't mention it. I'm glad you're back."

The four of them walked back together.

"Thank you so much, Alexander."
"Come over for dinner sometime? I'll cook myself. Let you taste my skills!"
David Sullivan issued the invitation warmly.

Isabella nodded in agreement.

On the topic of inviting people to dinner.
The family of three were exactly the same.

But there were differences—
David wanted to show off his cooking skills.
Isabella was purely hospitable.
Sophia just loved to cook. She enjoyed it. She often made too much for one person. An extra mouth was perfect!

Alexander's gaze swept imperceptibly over the girl.
He didn't stand on ceremony. He nodded and accepted immediately.

Back home, Isabella teased David.
"Look at you, so eager. Afraid people won't know you're a good cook?"

David chuckled.
"Good skills should be shown off~ How will people know otherwise?"

"Such a show-off!"

Sophia changed into slippers and walked inside.
She asked casually, "Dad, when did you get so familiar with the Professor?"
"You keep calling him 'Alexander'."

David shook his head.
"You don't understand. Relationships are built. Alexander and I both study physics. And we love chess. We just started talking back and forth."

Isabella pierced his bubble mercilessly.
"Don't listen to him. Your dad just wants someone to discuss research papers with."

Isabella didn't understand the specialized physics knowledge.
She couldn't discuss it with him.

David's students were even less possible.
They were all still high schoolers. Learning basic physics concepts. They hadn't touched specialized fields of physics. Let alone those complex research papers.

When Sophia was in high school, she could at least listen to his one-sided output.
Even if they couldn't discuss it, David could at least express himself smoothly.

After his daughter went to college, he could only bury his head in papers alone.

No one understood his academic loneliness. Until…
He met Alexander Laurent!

"Alexander is really great."

This was the second time Sophia had heard this phrase in recent days.

Isabella joked.
"You two get along so well, you should become academic brothers. Makes communication easier later."

David rubbed his chin.
He seemed to be considering the feasibility of this proposal.

…

A couple of days later, David suddenly brought up the dinner.
"Sophia, did you notify Alexander?"

"Huh?" Sophia was a bit confused. "Wasn't it just being polite?"

"Who said it was just being polite? We invited him, we can't go back on our word!"

He straightened his face, expression serious.

Then he turned to Isabella and immediately switched to a smile.
"Right, honey?"

Sophia was speechless.
"You've mastered face-changing without even studying Sichuan Opera."

David patted her shoulder.
"Sweetie, this glorious task is yours. Call or message him. Just extend the invitation. Whether he comes is up to Alexander. Your mom and I will go buy groceries…"

He hurried out without stopping.

Sophia was completely exasperated.
"Whatever, as long as they're happy…"

Lab —
Alexander was checking two sets of data from last week.
He found a deviation in the fourth column of the second set. He was about to call Dr. Simon Lowell. Suddenly, his phone rang.

He picked it up casually —
"Hello?"

"Professor, it's Sophia Sullivan."

Alexander's movements paused.
His gaze, originally fixed on the screen, slowly shifted away. His tone unconsciously softened. "What's wrong? Is something the matter?"

"It's about what my dad said the other day, wanting to invite you over for dinner, he'd cook himself… If you're busy, it's fine. I'll just tell him…"

"I'm free."

Sophia paused for a few seconds. "The lab isn't busy?"

"It's manageable."

"Then…"

Alexander's voice was gentle. "See you tonight. Thank your father for me, for going to the trouble of cooking."

"Y-You're welcome."

Hanging up, Sophia was a little dazed.
"That's not right…"

Just yesterday, Dr. Zoe Langley had complained to her over WeChat.
Said the whole team was swamped lately trying to meet deadlines.

How could he say it was manageable?

Over there, Professor Quincy Evans saw Alexander finish his call.
He leaned over and deliberately nudged his shoulder. "Who was that? Was it our dear Sophia? I heard her voice."

Alexander gave him a cool glance. "You know, so why ask?"

Quincy snorted. "I've pulled three all-nighters. Zoe and Simon are complaining nonstop too. Only you, Professor Laurent, can casually say 'manageable'. A man with plans is indeed different."

Truth was, Alexander had been working harder than anyone.
But coming from him, why did it sound so light and easy?

Were the rest of them doing fake experiments, writing fake reports, and fake papers?

Alexander moved aside, putting some distance between them.
Then he pointed at his watch. "If I recall correctly, it's been over nine hours since I gave you the initial experimental data yesterday. How much have you reviewed? Is the accuracy rate up to standard? Deviations corrected? When do you plan to have the report ready?"

The deadly four questions.

Quincy immediately pulled a long face. "Sorry to bother you. I'll take my leave."

He returned to his own lab bench. Looked at the pile of unprocessed data on his computer.

At times like this, Quincy missed Sophia terribly.
If she were still here, she'd whip up a program in minutes. This data would be like magic, instantly transforming from chaos to order.

Sigh. Easy to go from frugality to luxury, hard to go back!
If only dear Sophia could be a permanent fixture in their lab…

…

Six PM, Alexander showed up at Sophia's house with a bottle of red wine.

David heard the commotion and ran out of the kitchen holding a spatula. He greeted him with a beaming smile. "Alexander, you're here!"

"Hello, Uncle. Sorry for the trouble."

"Oh, no trouble at all! Come in, come in—"

Isabella moved to get him slippers. Alexander stopped her. "No need, I can help myself."

Then Isabella watched as he skillfully took a pair of slippers from the shoe cabinet and put them on.

He then handed over a bottle of red wine.

Isabella smiled. "You didn't have to bring anything, just coming is enough."

"It's the least I could do. A friend gave me this bottle, so I'm just passing on the favor."

Isabella accepted it with a smile, glanced at the origin and vintage, and raised an eyebrow slightly.

Her eyes then swept over the slippers on Alexander's feet, her gaze deepening thoughtfully…
###Chapter 180
Isabella Sullivan opened the bottle of red wine, and Sophia Sullivan was also given a small half-glass.

Who would have thought…

She actually went for two refills!

David Sullivan was deeply engrossed in conversation, and Isabella Sullivan was busy savoring the dishes. No one noticed her except…

Alexander Laurent: "Sophia, that's your third glass."

"!" Sophia's hand, reaching for the bottle, froze mid-air.

Only then did David and Isabella Sullivan realize she had unconsciously drunk so much.

"We said you could try a little, not drink it like water!" Isabella Sullivan was both amused and exasperated.

She also enjoyed red wine, but always in moderation, unlike her silly daughter…

David also disapproved, but his focus was—

"Alex, true to your scientific background, so meticulous! So observant! No wonder you've achieved such remarkable academic success at such a young age…"

That's right, David had already thoroughly researched Alexander's accomplishments in the field of physics through various channels.

His exclamations of admiration were continuous and effusive.

Even Isabella Sullivan teased him: "Your father is obsessed."

Sophia hadn't felt it much before, as Alexander's academic standing was something only those within the circle truly understood—how extraordinary, how outstanding, how astonishing it was.

But now, she completely agreed with the "obsessed" description—

He could even find a way to praise this?

Sophia seriously suspected her father saw Alexander through rose-colored glasses.

Extremely thick ones.

"Alex, you pay such close attention to Sophia, even noticing such small details. I, as her father, feel ashamed I can't match that…" David said, taking a sip of his wine.

Suddenly, he set down his glass and said seriously, "How about we become sworn brothers? Then Sophia can call you Uncle."

Pfft—

Isabella Sullivan nearly spat out the wine she had just sipped.

Sophia: "?"

Alexander Laurent: "???!!!"

Seeing no response, David nodded to himself. "What a brilliant idea! The more I think about it, the better it seems! You see, Isabella and I live in the neighboring city, and Sophia is all alone in Kyoto with no one to look out for her."

"You're steady, thoughtful, exceptionally capable. You could guide her a bit, both in life and in her studies."

"Of course, rest assured, I'm absolutely not asking for special favors. I just… hic!… just thought it would be good for her to have an elder's care in a place where she has no family…"

Every time David said "elder" or mentioned "Uncle," Alexander's eyebrow twitched uncontrollably.

As David became more and more invested, seemingly ready to swear brotherhood with Alexander on the spot, Isabella Sullivan finally snapped out of it.

She snatched his glass. "What nonsense are you talking? A few extra sips and you lose all sense of propriety, saying whatever comes to mind! Alex is what age? An uncle to your daughter? What were you thinking!"

Alexander sat rigidly in his chair, not daring to move or speak.

He cheered for Isabella Sullivan silently in his heart.

Sophia also came to her senses and quickly apologized. "I'm so sorry, Professor. My dad gets like this when he drinks too much—his imagination runs wild, and he can't stop talking. Please don't take it to heart…"

"Ahem!" What could Alexander say?

What dared he say?

"It's fine. Your father is drunk. I don't mind."

"Who's drunk? I'm not drunk!" David looked at his wife, then his daughter, finally settling his clear-eyed gaze on Alexander's face. "Alex, I truly consider you a brother…"

Alexander: "…" Please, no. Don't.

"Enough!" Isabella Sullivan's sharp command finally stopped David from continuing.

But his form of address for Alexander changed to—

"Little brother, don't stand on ceremony, eat more! Try this Peach Blossom Mandarin Fish, my signature dish." David said cheerfully.

Alexander: "…" Seriously. Thanks.

"How is it, little brother? To your taste?"

Alexander: "…Delicious."

David's eyes lit up, as if he had met a soulmate and regretted not meeting sooner. "If you like it, have more! And this Crystal Beef, with my secret sauce…"

Alexander, throughout: "Excellent… Flavorful… Unique preparation… First time trying this…"

Consequently, David became even more enthusiastic.

Finally, the meal ended. When Alexander stood up to leave, he felt as if he had received a great pardon.

But the next second—

David: "Sophia, see your Uncle Alex out."

Alexander: "!"

So very tired.

"…Oh!" Sophia stood up.

Perhaps the wine's delayed effect was hitting her. She felt dizzy, her reactions slowed.

But her complexion remained normal.

Her gaze was still clear.

She walked Alexander to the door. The moment she stepped out, the wind caught the door behind her, slamming it shut with a bang.

There wasn't really much to 'see out'—he lived next door.

She waved at Alexander. Whether it was the alcohol or a momentary lapse, the words slipped out—

"Goodbye, Uncle Alex."

Alexander's steps halted. He turned sharply to look at her, his gaze deep, like two bottomless whirlpools.

He stepped closer, enunciating each word slowly. "What did you call me? Hmm?"

The rising inflection held a hidden danger.

It drilled into Sophia's ears, sending a tingling electric current through her.

She looked up dazedly. Their eyes met, and she was abruptly pulled into the depths of the man's gaze.

One second, two seconds…

A full five seconds passed before Sophia regained her senses.

Whether from embarrassment or genuine intoxication, a blush instantly spread across her cheeks.

It deepened, spreading until it burned the tips of her ears, turning them completely red.

The girl's clear, bright black eyes were like mountain springs, pure and innocent. Coupled with her biting her lip, shyness gradually surfaced.

"S-sorry… I-I don't know why I said that. I meant to call you Professor Laurent…"

What the hell was "Uncle Alex"!

Sophia covered her burning face in despair, wishing she could faint on the spot.

Then, the man let out a low chuckle—

"Will you dare to overindulge next time?"

Alexander had noticed early on that Sophia had a bit of a fondness for alcohol. This included, but wasn't limited to, drinking with Olivia Lopez to drown sorrows, and wanting to open a beer when treating him to a meal.

He never expected she'd dare to drink glass after glass right in front of her parents.

"You've got some nerve!" As he spoke, he lightly tapped the top of her head.

The action stunned them both.

Alexander was shocked by his own quick reflex. Reason told him this was inappropriate—she was a woman, such contact was too intimate, easily misunderstood—but his action had been faster than his thoughts.

Sophia was just bewildered.

The man's touch wasn't heavy; it was even gentle, just brushing through her hair.

Her bewilderment was half from the alcohol slowing her reactions, and the other half because…

"Professor, do you know that tapping someone's head makes them stupid?"

Alexander: "…I know now."

"Then what if I become stupid?"

"You…"

"If I become stupid, how can I participate in the academic competitions?! How can I win a gold medal?!"

Alexander: "??"

Academic competitions?

Gold medal?

He was silent for two seconds. "…Sophia Sullivan, what grade are you in now?"

"Tenth grade. Why?"

"…"

Right. Now she was truly drunk.
###Chapter 181

Sophia Sullivan had no memory of that period.

She only remembered David Sullivan telling her to see Alexander Laurent out.

She did as she was told.

And then?

Then her memory cut out.

When she opened her eyes again, it was the next morning.

She was comfortably stretching in her own bed.

Nothing felt out of the ordinary.

Isabella Sullivan pushed the door open.

She handed Sophia a glass of warm water.

"Awake?"

Sophia sat up and took the glass.

She had just taken a sip.

When she heard David's voice.

"See if you dare sneak a drink again! You wouldn't listen to anyone when you were drunk. You were a complete little lunatic."

Drunk?

Lunatic?

Sophia froze mid-sip.

Fragmented memories flashed through her mind.

But she couldn't grasp any of them.

She swallowed hard.

Her tone was cautious.

"Dad, what did I… do yesterday?"

"Hmph! What did you do? You don't remember?"

Sophia shook her head frantically.

She truly didn't remember.

"You were supposed to see Alexander out, but you ended up messing up his hair. He didn't even get angry and even carried you back…"

"Alright," Isabella interrupted, "stop embarrassing her. Someone's face is about to turn as red as a monkey's bottom! Let's go, let her collect herself."

She then shooed David out of the room.

And thoughtfully closed the door behind them.

One second.

Two seconds.

On the third second—

A mortified wail erupted from the bedroom: "Aaaah!"

The humiliation was complete!

David and Isabella exchanged a look.

They couldn't help but laugh.

Isabella said, "Your daughter has the same terrible drinking etiquette as you."

David retorted, "And she's like you, too. Can't hold her liquor but loves to drink anyway."

Isabella glared at him. "Looking for trouble?"

David immediately waved his hands. "I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare."

…

The family of three was happy and harmonious.

Their days were peaceful and joyful.

In contrast, Victoria Roscente had been having a difficult time lately.

Since Deborah Melville and her son caused that scene at the hotel.

And discovered no one could control them.

It was like they had gotten a taste of success.

For several days in a row, they staked out outside the Roscente family's old estate.

They had mastered the art of being shameless troublemakers.

The very sight of this mother-son pair gave Victoria a headache.

That glob of phlegm still made her feel sick.

She heard from security that the two came to stake out every day.

Rain or shine.

They brought their own little stools and dry rations.

They seemed prepared for a long-term occupation.

It had gotten to the point where she was afraid to leave the house!

"Well? Are those two still out there?"

In the living room, Victoria spoke through gritted teeth.

She asked a servant who had just returned from grocery shopping.

The servant looked fearful. "Y-yes, they're still there. When Mrs. Wang and I went out, that man and woman stared at us fiercely. Their eyes were so vicious, it felt like they were about to charge at us and kill us the next second. It terrified us."

Deborah wasn't stupid.

This was a private residence, unlike a hotel where they could force their way in.

Causing trouble could get them charged with trespassing, which wasn't worth it.

So she and Tyson Richter just kept watch.

They arrived on time every day.

And left on time.

They didn't do anything.

Just sat there.

Staring with their unsettling eyes at everyone who passed by.

It caused everyone in the old estate to gossip and feel uneasy.

To avoid this mother and son, Victoria had already been shut in for a week.

She grew more anxious and restless by the day.

She also had to endure the servants' gossip behind her back.

But she thought since so many days had passed.

Those two would have to leave eventually.

So she gritted her teeth and waited them out.

She didn't expect that after almost a week.

The two showed no intention of stopping.

Victoria had had enough!

She thought of the beautiful nine-square grid photos the ladies in her social circle were posting.

While she was trapped at home like a prisoner?

The more she thought about it, the angrier she became.

The angrier she got, the more she wanted to go out!

"Old Omelas—" Victoria called for the driver. "Get ready. I'm going out in twenty minutes."

"Yes, Madam."

Victoria went upstairs to change and put on makeup.

The driver was already waiting and ready.

She bent down and got into the car.

"Let's go."

Before the car could even drive out of the main gate.

They could see the mother and son squatting by the iron gate from a distance.

One on the left, one on the right, like two evil spirits.

"Madam, these two have been squatting at the entrance. What if they rush to block the car?"

The driver said this because a few days ago, when he drove out for maintenance.

These two had stopped him.

They only let him go after seeing no one was in the car with him.

The driver was annoyed too.

These two had no shame and no regard for their safety.

He just wanted to keep his job and get paid every month.

He didn't want to risk his life.

Victoria sneered. "Ignore them. Drive straight out without stopping. I'll take responsibility if anything happens!"

The driver was scared.

But he didn't dare disobey Victoria's order.

As the car drove out, the two of them lunged forward like dogs catching a scent.

They immediately blocked the way.

The driver instinctively wanted to hit the brakes.

But he felt Victoria's piercing gaze from the back seat.

He didn't dare stop.

He could only grit his teeth, step on the accelerator, and charge forward.

Deborah and Tyson weren't new to blocking cars.

Previously, the drivers had always obediently stopped.

Why was this time different…

Deborah's face changed dramatically.

She quickly pulled her son aside to avoid the car.

The next second, the car shot through the spot where they had just been standing.

It was moving extremely fast.

If they hadn't moved out of the way…

"How dare you! Trying to run us over!"

"No doubt that old bitch Victoria is in the car!"

"These so-called wealthy families are all insane maniacs! If you really hit us, you couldn't afford the compensation!"

"Don't think just because you got out today means you can get out tomorrow or the day after! If you don't give us an answer, we'll come every day and make a scene! We'll make sure all the neighbors, everyone above and below, knows about this! If you make our lives difficult, we'll make your entire family lose face!"

Shouts and curses came from behind.

Victoria looked back coldly.

She saw the mother and son jumping up and down in place.

For some reason, her mood lifted considerably.

Tyson asked, "Mom, what do we do now? She's already left. Do we still keep watch?"

They were staking out daily to force Victoria to show herself.

Now that Victoria was gone.

Only servants and security were left in the mansion.

Continuing to watch seemed pointless.

"She left, but that doesn't mean she's not coming back. If you're tired, go home first. I'll stay here and keep watch! Let's see if she has the guts to never come back!"

Deborah's thinking was simple.

She didn't have a job and had plenty of time to waste.

Tyson thought it made sense. "Then I won't go back either. I'll stay here and watch until they give us the money!"

But they waited for two full days.

"Mom, you don't think she's really not coming back, do you?" Tyson was covered in mosquito bites. He scratched here and there, his face and neck covered in red welts.

Deborah pursed her lips. "I don't believe it. This is her home. Where else would she go if not home?"

"But rich people have so many houses. Anywhere can be home…"

Just then, Tyson's phone rang.

He answered impatiently.

But the next second, after hearing what the person on the other end said.

His eyes lit up.

He thanked them profusely and said he'd treat them to a meal later.

After hanging up, he looked at Deborah.

His expression was excited…
###Chapter 182

"Mom, Easton Shaw found out which company that bastard works for!"

Easton Shaw was a local troublemaker, usually idle.
But he had a knack for gathering information.
Tyson Richter hadn't held out much hope.
Unexpectedly, he actually succeeded.

"Excellent! I was worried we couldn't find him. Now we have a way. Come on, son, let's go find him—"
Deborah Melville's eyes lit up, eager and impatient.

Lately, staking out the Roscente residence had only made Victoria Roscente afraid to leave her house.
It had achieved nothing else.
But now things were different...

Half an hour later.

"This is Ethan Roscente's company? Such an impressive building. How rich must he be?"
Tyson tilted his head back, staring at the towering glass facade.
His Adam's apple bobbed. Greed glittered in his eyes.

Deborah also clicked her tongue in awe. "Goodness, your sister really landed a wealthy one this time. This level of luxury isn't your average rich!"
If they could seize this chance to get a payout, they'd be set for life.

Mother and son exchanged a look.
They walked inside without hesitation.

Ethan's company was located in a prime downtown area.
Security was tight. Outsiders couldn't just enter.
Deborah spotted some janitors cleaning.
She sneaked into a supply closet, found two sets of uniforms, and they disguised themselves as cleaners to slip inside.

The moment they entered the lobby, the opulent interior stunned them.
They gaped around, completely out of place.
Oblivious, they followed the crowd into an elevator when the doors opened.

"Son, did your friend say which floor he's on?"
Deborah felt dizzy looking at the dense array of floor buttons.

Tyson shook his head. "No, but the boss must be on the top floor."
The elevator dinged open.
It was the top floor.

They stepped out. "It's so big. Which way?" Deborah asked.
Tyson was also bewildered. The place was enormous, with no signs. "Just... straight ahead, maybe?"
They decided to try their luck.

Not far ahead, they spotted a plaque: "CEO's Office." Tyson's eyes lit up.

Suddenly—
"You two, stop right there! I'm talking to you!"
An assistant rose from his workstation and strode toward them, his gaze scrutinizing.
"Which floor are you cleaners from? What are you doing on the top floor?"
And heading straight for Mr. Roscente's office...
Highly suspicious.

"S-sorry..." Deborah immediately fabricated a lie. "We're new. We accidentally got on the wrong floor. Since we're here, we might as well clean..."
She made a move toward the office.

"Stop! You can't just enter Mr. Roscente's office. Cleaning is handled by specific personnel."
The assistant's eyes fell on Tyson's face. This cleaner...
He was too young! And a man!
He frowned. "If you could get on the elevator, you must have key cards. Show them to me."

Deborah froze.
Tyson began to panic, his eyes darting away.

The assistant grew more certain these two were trouble. "If you can't produce key cards, I'll have to call security!"

Seeing the ruse was up, Deborah dropped the act.
She sneered, straightened her posture. "Who said we're cleaners? I'm here to see Ethan Roscente. Tell him to come out!"
Tyson found his courage too. "Why does a mere employee care so much? Get Ethan Roscente out here! We have business with him!"

The assistant watched their brazen performance, his brow furrowed.
He was about to call security when Ethan emerged from a conference room.

"Mr. Roscente..."
The assistant breathed a sigh of relief.

Ethan had just finished a negotiation.
He saw two cleaners causing a commotion outside his office from a distance.
Connecting it with what Victoria had mentioned days before, he immediately guessed who they were.

"Go attend to your duties," he dismissed the assistant with a wave.
Then, he pushed open his office door.
Without needing an invitation, Deborah and Tyson swaggered inside.

Only then did Ethan take a proper look at them.
The woman had sagging skin, sunken eyes.
Her features had a good foundation; she must have been a beauty in her youth.
Unfortunately, her chin was sharp, her lips thin, her eyes shifty, giving her a mean, calculating look.
Isabella Langley resembled her by about sixty or seventy percent.

As for Tyson...
He had a narrow, foxy face, dressed like a hoodlum, clearly not holding down a proper job.

While Ethan assessed them, Deborah was doing the same.
The man was tall, handsome, impeccably dressed in a suit, like a leading man from a TV drama.
Only his eyes were too cold. Not an easy mark...
Her gaze fell on the watch on Ethan's wrist.
She didn't recognize the brand, but it was studded with diamonds, glittering brightly. It had to be worth a fortune.
That damn girl sure knew how to pick them!

Deborah swallowed, her greed almost palpable.
She itched to get straight to talking money.
But then she reconsidered. She couldn't rush this. The final step had to be steady.
She lifted her chin, adopting the posture of someone seeking justice. "So you're Ethan Roscente? You got my daughter pregnant and then abandoned her? Think our family has no one? You have to give us an explanation today!"

"An explanation?" Ethan smiled, a cold smile that didn't reach his eyes.

"That's right! If it weren't for you, how could she have ended up like this? You bastard! Give me back my daughter's innocence—"
She raised her hand as if to strike him.
But under the man's icy stare, she flinched, shrinking her neck, and awkwardly lowered her hand.

Seeing this, Tyson stepped forward to back her up. "Think our family has no one? You slept with my sister for free. Now she's lying in the hospital after a miscarriage, suffering so much. You have to make this right!"
"This is a society of laws, we follow rules. Push us too far and we'll see you in court! See who ends up embarrassed!"

Ethan watched their performance calmly, his expression unreadable.
Finally—
"Finished?"

Deborah and Tyson exchanged a glance. "What... what do you mean?"

Ethan's voice was flat. "Just say it. How much do you want?"
###Chapter 183
Not Worth the Price

Ethan Roscente stood before the floor-to-ceiling window.

He came from privilege.

But his success was his own.

Built from the ground up.

He had seen too many people like Deborah Melville and Tyson Richter.

They said pretty words.

But only wanted more money.

Just as expected—

Deborah's eyes darted.

"Since you're being direct, I won't beat around the bush. You hurt my daughter. Compensation is due. We want this much…"

She held up five fingers.

Ethan raised an eyebrow.

Deborah said, "Seven point two million USD. Not a cent less!"

Ethan laughed.

It wasn't anger.

He found it ridiculous.

Tyson was also stunned.

Weren't they agreed on fifty thousand?

How did it become seven million?

Deborah snapped, "What are you laughing at? My daughter's youth and health can't be measured by money!"

Ethan smirked. "Can't be measured? Or simply worthless? Think carefully before you speak."

How many times had Isabella Langley schemed against him?

His lack of retaliation was mercy enough.

And they still dared to ask for money?

Truly desperate.

"What do you mean?" Deborah's face darkened. "How dare you say my daughter is worthless?!"

"Based on her throwing herself at me, getting pregnant by trickery, and then losing the baby herself."

Deborah's eyes shifted.

She clearly knew the truth.

Ethan gave a faint, mocking smile. "You don't seem innocent either."

Deborah exploded. "You heartless bastard! You did wrong and now you blame us? Where we come from, people like you get beaten!"

"You ruined my daughter's virtue and try to shirk responsibility? I won't have it!"

"If you won't pay, then marry her! Take responsibility!"

Ethan's face was expressionless.

This time, he couldn't even be bothered to laugh.

So Isabella's cheapness and greed were inherited.

Deborah didn't notice the coldness in the man's eyes.

She continued, "Seven million for a clean break. We act like it never happened. We'll never bother you again. A good deal, right?"

Ethan said, "First, Isabella isn't worth that price. Second, your threats mean nothing to me."

"Finally—get out! Call security!"

His assistant immediately picked up the phone.

Security arrived quickly.

They threw Deborah and her son out of the building.

"Oof—" Deborah landed on the ground.

"Mom—are you okay?" Tyson hurried to help her up.

He looked disheveled himself.

His hair was a mess.

His T-shirt wrinkled.

Deborah stood up and shouted at the building. "What nonsense! How dare you throw me out?! Just you wait, I'll @#￥%…"

"I'm furious! It was so hard to get in, and that Ethan Roscente wouldn't budge!"

"Mom, what if he doesn't agree? Will we get nothing? It's your fault! Wasn't it fifty thousand? Why seven million? Do you think rich people are stupid?"

"Shut up!" Deborah snorted. "What can fifty thousand do these days? Can't even buy a decent car. Is that all you aspire to?"

"But… if we ask for too much, they won't pay! Better to get the fifty thousand…"

"Fool! Is that your ambition?! Look at this building! Look at Victoria Roscente's house! Look at Ethan's watch! Each is worth more than fifty thousand!"

"They have plenty of money. What's wrong with asking for more? Even if we don't get seven million, we should get at least five hundred thousand!"

Tyson was tempted.

Fifty thousand and five hundred thousand were worlds apart.

"But they ignored us completely. We couldn't even get five dollars, let alone seven million…" Tyson said dejectedly.

But Deborah was confident. "Do you know what the wealthy care about most?"

"What?"

"Reputation! The richer they are, the more they care. No matter what, your sister is the victim. Ethan is at fault. We are in the right! Weren't you recording when we confronted Victoria Roscente at the hotel? Edit it and post it online."

"Netizens love drama, especially involving the rich! Once it blows up, I doubt they can sit still!"

Tyson quickly contacted a friend.

"Mom, you're amazing, thinking of this! Hey, Rat, I need a favor…"

At three in the afternoon.

Tyson posted a video on TikTok.

In the video.

A blurred-face middle-aged woman grabbed a well-dressed lady.

Accusing her son of seduction and abandonment.

Getting her daughter pregnant!

A group of wealthy ladies stood by watching.

The person recording claimed to be the victim's brother, seeking justice for his sister.

The title was: #Witness! Top-tier socialite gets confronted, the truth is…#

Wealthy elite.

Socialite.

Confrontation.

Every keyword hit the gossip sweet spot.

A confrontation wasn't rare.

But the one being confronted was a society matron.

Instantly dramatic.

Tyson spent two thousand on "TikTok+" promotion.

It worked well.

Soon the comments section buzzed.

[So society ladies pull hair too, hehe!]

[Entertaining, love it, more please!]

[One socialite gets confronted, a bunch watch the show, brilliant!]

[Which socialite is this? Is her hair okay? Balding yet?]

[The Roscentes (am I allowed to say that?)]

[Summary: Rich heir got someone pregnant, the girl's mom confronts the scumbag's mother.]

[I just admire this mom. Women are weak, but motherhood makes them strong.]

[Wake up. Clearly the price wasn't right. If the money was enough, why go public?]

[Above comment speaks truth. Going public is just to extort more money. Don't be used.]

The comments grew livelier.

Shares and likes kept climbing.

Tyson hummed triumphantly.

But his joy was short-lived.

A violation notice appeared in the backend.

The video was quickly taken down.

Tyson was dumbfounded.

He grabbed his phone, refreshing constantly. "Where's my video? Where is it?!"
###Chapter 184
You Handle This Mess Yourself!

The phone rang.

Ethan Roscente answered.

The cold voice of the legal counsel from his company came through.

Evidence collection was complete.

They reserved the right to pursue legal action.

He was warned to behave.

Or there would be no mercy.

Ethan's hand trembled slightly.

Deborah Melville snorted with derision.

Just lawyers trying to scare people.

Keep posting.

For every post he deletes, we post another.

The plan was ambitious.

Reality was harsh.

Every post was instantly deleted.

The promotion money was wasted.

Five thousand dollars, gone.

Deborah urged him to continue.

Ethan gave a bitter smile.

He was out of money.

Maybe she could provide some?

Deborah was silent for a moment.

Then try a different method.

Register more accounts.

Don't spend money, just keep posting.

Ethan hesitated.

Without promotion, there was no visibility.

No visibility meant no pressure.

Ethan Roscente wasn't taking them seriously at all.

Trying to use public opinion to pressure him?

Naive.

His assistant asked for instructions on how to proceed.

No visibility, ignore it.

Understood.

But Deborah and her son had genuinely disgusted Ethan.

They had even alarmed the corporate PR department.

The Roscente Group was now under Julian Roscente's control.

He was extremely busy.

He shouldn't have noticed such a trivial matter.

But his chief secretary was very capable.

She spotted the video as soon as it appeared.

She reported it immediately.

And instructed the PR department to prepare a contingency plan.

Julian knew his son.

One look at the video told him it was real.

He told his secretary to call.

He ordered Ethan to return to the family estate immediately.

...

When Ethan arrived.

Victoria Roscente stood with her head bowed beside Julian.

Not daring to make a sound.

Hearing footsteps.

She quickly shot him a look.

Be careful, your father is furious.

Ethan's expression didn't change.

He stepped forward and called out, "Father."

Julian's cold gaze swept over both of them.

Causing trouble right before the shareholder meeting?

Victoria spoke softly, trying to placate him.

They're just two troublemakers.

They can't stir up real trouble.

They won't affect the meeting.

Julian gave a cold laugh.

Flies are disgusting.

No matter what method you use.

Clean this up immediately.

There can be no negative publicity before the shareholder meeting.

He issued a final warning to Ethan.

Behave.

Do you understand?

Yes.

After the reprimand, Julian left in a hurry.

Ethan irritably loosened his tie.

I told you we couldn't keep Isabella Langley's baby.

You didn't listen.

You insisted on keeping it.

Now look at the mess.

I'm done.

You handle this yourself.

He turned and walked away.

Victoria, scolded by her husband and blamed by her son.

Trembled with rage.

It's all my fault?

Who have I been working so hard for?

You don't understand at all!

Go!

Just go!

Don't come back!

My husband yells at me.

My son is unfilial.

My grandchild is gone.

What did I do to deserve this?

After her outburst, Victoria collapsed onto the sofa.

But the problem still needed solving.

She took a deep breath.

She told the butler to find Deborah's contact information.

He soon provided a phone number.

Victoria composed herself.

She dialed the number.

Hello? Who is this? Deborah sounded irritated.
The video wasn't gaining traction.

Victoria identified herself.

Deborah's eyes lit up.
Her irritation vanished instantly.

Oh— she drew out the word.
She put on airs.

It's you.

What do you want?

It seemed the video had an effect.

Let's talk. Victoria said directly.

Deborah exchanged a look with her son.

Talk about what?

What do we have to talk about?

Victoria was so angry she laughed.

Stop pretending.

You caused trouble for money, didn't you?

Deborah's eyes shifted.

Don't say that.

I'm seeking justice for my daughter.

How is that asking for money?

Playing the victim! Victoria sneered.

Deborah gritted her teeth.

You're begging me.

Get your position straight.

No more nonsense.

How much?

Consider it a charitable donation.

A beggar?

Charity?

Deborah laughed angrily.

She had wanted money.

But Victoria's condescending attitude was infuriating.

She changed her mind.

What's the hurry?

Who tried to run us over just the other day?

Looked down on us?

Why are you calling now?

Deborah wanted the money.

But she wanted to humiliate Victoria first to vent her anger.

Victoria cursed her for not knowing her place.

She wanted to hang up.

But she remembered Julian's warning.

She held back.

Name your price.

Deborah sensed her impatience and disgust.

She refused to name a price.

What's the hurry?

Apologize first.

Victoria bit her tongue and endured it.

The driver wasn't paying attention.

I'll fire him later.

Deborah snorted.

What good is firing the driver?

You think that settles it?

Just paying up isn't enough.

What do you want then? Victoria's patience snapped.

Deborah said leisurely.

You need to show some sincerity.

Mrs. Roscente.

A chill ran down Victoria's spine.

A bad feeling washed over her.
###Chapter 185

Victoria Roscente suppressed her fury.
"What kind of sincerity do you want?"

Deborah Melville felt a secret thrill seeing her so flustered.

"You're eager to discuss the price, I understand."
"But since we arrived in Kyoto, we've been staying in hospital rooms, sleeping on those awful caregiver cots."
"Every part of us aches."
"Then, a few days ago, your driver terrified us."
"We're traumatized, both physically and mentally."
"We need to recover properly before we can talk…"

"Just state your terms!" Victoria's temple throbbed visibly.

Deborah raised an eyebrow.
"First, arrange a hotel for me and my son."
"A five-star one."
"Preferably the Presidential Suite."

Tyson Richter added quietly, "Presidential Suite."

"Yes, we want the Presidential Suite!"

Victoria took a deep breath.
"Fine!"

She immediately instructed the butler to book the hotel.

That evening, the mother and son checked into the InterContinental Hotel.

The Presidential Suite was fully booked.
After much persuasion from the butler, Deborah reluctantly agreed to an Executive Suite.

Its luxury left them speechless.

"Two bedrooms, three bathrooms!"
"There's even a gym and a pool…" Tyson's jaw dropped.
"Rich people really know how to live!"

Deborah ran her hand over the leather sofa.
"And this isn't the best one?"
"What must the Presidential Suite be like?"
"How much does it cost per night?"

Tyson shrugged.
"Who cares? We're not paying!"
"Mom, look at this menu. I've never even heard of these dishes…"

Deborah opened the menu.

There were two full books, covering every cuisine imaginable.

The prices made her gasp.

The cheapest item was over two hundred.

Highway robbery?

"Mom, I'm hungry…" Tyson stared at the pictures, swallowing hard.

Deborah's eyes lit up.
She called Victoria.
"Just a place to stay isn't enough."
"I need good food and drink to recover properly."

Victoria didn't want to argue.
"Order whatever you want. Put it on the room tab."
"Don't bother me."

She hung up immediately.

Deborah smiled, putting her phone away.
"Order. It's on the house."

"Really? We don't pay?"

"Didn't you hear? Order anything!"

She deliberately picked the most expensive items.

Soon, a server arrived with a cart, offering impeccable service with a constant smile.
He even poured their wine with care.

The pair ate Western food they'd never tasted before, enjoying the top-tier service.
They felt like they were in heaven.

Is this how the wealthy live?

Seven point two million dollars… we definitely asked for too little.

…

Victoria assumed that after her demands were met, Deborah would enjoy herself for a few days before discussing money.

Then, she could dismiss her with a few hundred thousand.

A million at most.

It was less than the cost of one of her coats.
A small price to pay for peace.

Two days later, Deborah called.
But it wasn't about the money.

"…What did you say?!"

Deborah repeated herself.
"Take us to that hotel for afternoon tea. The one from last time."
"Is that a problem?"

Victoria fought the urge to throw her phone.
"It's members only!"

"So?"

"Non-members can't enter!"

"Then get me a membership! Simple."

Victoria gritted her teeth.

A membership? She made it sound so easy!

It required cumulative spending of two million for a lifetime membership.
Did Deborah Melville deserve that?

"I don't care. I want to go today. Figure it out."

In the end, Victoria used her own membership to bring them in.

They ran straight into a gathering of society ladies.

"Mrs. Roscente? Is that you?"

"We called out to you earlier, but you didn't respond."
"We thought we were mistaken."

Victoria forced a smile, though she was mortified and wanted to flee.

"I didn't hear… my apologies."

"And who are these two?" Someone scrutinized Deborah and Tyson.
"They look familiar. Have we met before?"

The inevitable had arrived.

Deborah answered cheerfully.
"Last time we were here, Mrs. Roscente and I had a little… disagreement."
"It got a bit loud. You were there, right?"

The ladies instantly remembered.

Their looks towards Victoria became filled with shock, suspicion, and deep meaning.

"So… you've worked it out? Made peace?" one of them asked.

Before Victoria could speak, Deborah cut in.
"All settled! We made peace ages ago!"
"Better to resolve a feud than keep it…"

She thought she was being gracious, unaware that Victoria wanted to sew her mouth shut.

Settled? That implied there was a dispute.

What dispute? Their minds went straight to Ethan Roscente.

It confirmed the rumor about getting a girl pregnant!

The gossip had been just speculation.
Ignoring it would have let it fade.
But Deborah had just admitted it openly!

"I see~" The lady who didn't get along with Victoria smiled even more brightly.

"We won't interrupt your little family gathering then. Let's go, everyone."

They left, satisfied, clutching this juicy piece of gossip.

Victoria stood frozen, her face dark with rage.
Family gathering? You're the one who's family with her!

Oblivious, Deborah looked around in awe.
"These chandeliers are huge…"
"Is that vase by the entrance an antique?"
"How much could it sell for?"

Victoria: "…" She truly wanted to slap her.

After enduring the mother and son wolfing down their afternoon tea, Victoria thought she was finally free.

But then—

Deborah pointed.
"That's a mall across the street, right? Let's go shopping!"

Victoria: "You go ahead. I have something to—"

"Go where? If you leave, who's going to pay?"

Victoria: "???"
###Chapter 186

Li Xiaolian and Shi Yanfeng walked out of the mall.

Their hands were full of shopping bags.

Li Xiaolian suddenly stopped.

She smacked her forehead. "Oh! I forgot to buy a necklace! Let's go back quickly..."

Shi Yanfeng's hands were completely full.

He was so tired he could barely lift his legs. "Mom, let's buy it another day. I can't carry anything else."

Li Xiaolian frowned.

Her gaze swept over Shu Yuqin's neck.

Her eyes lit up. "That necklace is nice. Give it to me. You can buy another one for yourself."

Shu Yuqin stood frozen.

It was a limited edition Cartier necklace.

She had waited four months for it.

It cost nearly a million.

How could Li Xiaolian just demand it?

Li Xiaolian pursed her lips. "What's that look? It's just a necklace, not your life! I don't even like that you've worn it. I'm giving you a chance to get a new one. Don't be ungrateful."

She turned to Shi Yanfeng. "Son, remember to send that video again when we get back."

Shu Yuqin's face turned pale.

She remembered Jiang Jiuyao's warning.

She suppressed her rage.

Gritting her teeth, she took off the necklace.

Li Xiaolian put it on immediately.

She asked Shi Yanfeng, "Does it look good?"

Shi Yanfeng grinned. "It looks great. Everything looks good on you, Mom."

Shu Yuqin said coldly, "Don't push your luck!"

She turned and walked away.

Li Xiaolian didn't stop her.

She happily admired the necklace in a glass reflection.

Shi Yanfeng asked, "You're just letting her leave like that?"

Li Xiaolian snorted. "What's the rush? We have time."

Three days later.

Li Xiaolian called Shu Yuqin. "I haven't seen any sights since I arrived in Kyoto. I heard the Palace Museum is nice..."

Shu Yuqin understood immediately. "I'll find you a tour guide."

Li Xiaolian cut her off. "We don't need a guide. You take us yourself."

Shu Yuqin took a deep breath. "A guide would be more professional..."

Li Xiaolian said, "We want to see your sincerity."

Shu Yuqin was silent.

Early the next morning.

She picked up Li Xiaolian and her son from their hotel.

They headed to the Palace Museum.

Li Xiaolian pointed at a phoenix crown in a display case. "This empress's hat is so ugly. It's all green, like it's rusted."

Shu Yuqin had no words.

Shi Yanfeng yawned. "It was dug up from a tomb. It's a dead person's thing. So unlucky."

Shu Yuqin wished she could get far away from them.

Country bumpkins!

Idiots!

Li Xiaolian complained, "There's not even a place to buy water here! And so many people! It's too crowded. Let's get out of here..."

Shu Yuqin was about to leave.

She suddenly saw Sophia Sullivan and Olivia Lopez.

Behind them were a middle-aged man and woman.

The man was taking pictures.

The woman was carefully appreciating the exhibits.

Shu Yuqin looked closer.

The woman resembled Sophia Sullivan by about sixty or seventy percent.

They were probably Sophia Sullivan's parents.

David Sullivan took photos while exclaiming, "This pearl-encrusted robe is exquisite..."

An elderly tour group gathered around.

They couldn't read the descriptions clearly.

They asked David Sullivan to explain.

David Sullivan gladly agreed.

He read the exhibit description aloud.

He added much background knowledge.

"...The pearl-encrusted robe is decorated with ivory, gold, and gemstones. It is a type of Buddhist robe from the Qing palace."

"Buddhist robes were enshrined in temples for worship."

More and more people gathered around.

Young people also came over.

Someone asked, "Sir, can you tell us about this dragon and phoenix crown?"

David Sullivan nodded. "This is Empress Xiaojing's phoenix crown from the Wanli era of the Ming Dynasty. It uses kingfisher feather art and is inlaid with pearls and gemstones..."

Young people checked their pamphlets.

They exclaimed in awe. "It really is Empress Xiaojing's!"

"Sir, you're amazing! Are you a history teacher?"

David Sullivan waved his hand with a smile. "I teach physics. History is just a hobby."

The crowd was astonished.

Olivia Lopez called out from the crowd, "You're the best, Uncle! And Auntie is so beautiful!"

Everyone looked at Isabella Sullivan.

She had an elegant demeanor.

Standing next to David Sullivan.

They made a perfect match.

Shu Yuqin watched from a distance.

She heard everyone's admiration.

Then she looked back at Li Xiaolian and her son.

One was eager to leave.

The other looked completely impatient.

A complex emotion welled up in her heart.

Without comparison.

There would be no realization of inferiority.
###Chapter 187

The crowd gradually dispersed.

Sophia Sullivan's group prepared to move to the next exhibition hall.

They turned around.

And came face to face with Victoria Roscente.

Olivia Lopez let out an exaggerated, "Whoa!"

Sophia's expression remained calm.

She coolly averted her gaze.

She and Victoria were strangers now.

Basic courtesy wasn't even necessary.

They could just pretend not to know each other.

It was less awkward for everyone that way.

Unexpectedly, Victoria took two proactive steps forward.

She smiled and greeted, "Sophia, you're visiting The Louvre too?"

David Sullivan and Isabella Sullivan exchanged a glance.

An acquaintance?

They hadn't heard their daughter knew this person…

They were curious about Victoria's identity.

Olivia leaned in and whispered a few words into their ears.

Isabella's gaze towards Victoria instantly changed.

David's smile vanished.

His eyes turned sharp in an instant.

Victoria felt awkward.

She was about to speak.

But Deborah Melville impatiently urged from the side—

"What's the holdup? Hurry up and leave! It's stuffy and hot in here, and it reeks of mildew! It's disgusting!"

Tyson Richter chimed in, "Yeah! I wish we hadn't come. Who cares about this dead people's stuff? Mom, I'm hungry."

Deborah lifted her chin.

She ordered Victoria, "Where's the food? Go buy some for my son. Make it good and expensive!"

Victoria wished she could vanish into the ground.

Sophia and Olivia exchanged a look.

Surprise was evident in both their eyes.

How could Victoria…

Tolerate such humiliation?

She was like a complete doormat!

Who were these two people?

Olivia's eyes gleamed.

She smiled at Tyson. "Hello, may I ask your name…"

A beautiful woman was initiating conversation.

Tyson's eyes lit up. "I'm Tyson Richter! And you?"

The surname Richter…

Sophia's gaze deepened.

She had already learned from Olivia that Isabella Langley had miscarried.

She was abandoned at the hospital.

Victoria showed no concern.

Ethan Roscente was also disgusted with her.

It had finally come to this.

The worst possible outcome.

After hearing it,

Sophia felt no satisfaction.

Only a sigh for another woman's tragic fate.

She threw away her education.

Ruined her health.

Lost her reputation and virtue.

All to keep a man…

Was it worth it?

Sophia felt immensely grateful.

Even after six years of foolishness,

She still had the chance to walk away.

Olivia asked, "And your relationship with Mrs. Roscente is…"

Tyson couldn't wait to answer. "She's taking us around The Louvre. So boring! We told her to leave, but she won't. She's like an idiot!"

Olivia suddenly understood.

She must have some leverage over her.

That's why she had to grovel like this.

"Auntie Victoria is so amusing! Usually surrounded by sycophants, who knew she'd one day be someone's little errand girl, running around, working herself to death. How does it feel? Quite novel, isn't it?"

Victoria gritted her teeth. "Olivia Lopez! Don't go too far! I am your elder!"

Olivia scoffed. "Please. The Lopez family has nothing to do with the Roscentes. Stop pulling rank."

"Besides, I'm not wrong! Aren't you a little errand girl? Oh, there is a difference—at least those people didn't have to be punching bags too!"

The words were too sharp.

They directly stabbed Victoria's sore spot.

Her face turned pale, then flushed.

It was a spectacular display.

"Sophia, Uncle, Auntie, let's go. There's nothing to say to people like this."

Deborah watched the group leave.

She glanced at Victoria's livid expression. "Tsk tsk, you've really offended a lot of people, haven't you?"

No wonder she's so detestable!

Victoria: "…"

The minor incident didn't affect Sophia's group's mood.

They finished touring two other exhibition halls.

Then found a Western restaurant for dinner.

"This place isn't cheap, is it?" Isabella could tell just from the entrance it was upscale.

Sophia linked arms with her. "We don't get out often. Of course I want to treat you to something different."

Isabella smiled.

She didn't want to spoil the mood.

David thought, how expensive could it be?

He looked at the menu.

And almost jumped out of his seat.

"The cheapest steak is over a thousand?!"

Sophia soothed him. "I have a membership card. We get a discount."

"Oh, oh, that's better…" He sat back down.

He took a sip of his lemon water.

And casually asked, "What's the discount?"

Sophia: "Five percent off."

"Pfft—"

"Dad! Composure! Image!"

Olivia laughed like a fool beside them.

Ha ha ha ha…

The dishes arrived one after another.

Once they tasted the food,

David had to admit.

You get what you pay for.

Meanwhile.

Deborah and her son had a quick, unsatisfactory bite at The Louvre.

It wasn't enough.

And it didn't taste good.

After they left,

She gave a signal.

Tyson proposed then: "I want Western food! The most expensive, highest-end kind! Don't try to fool me, or I'll just go to another place and keep eating."

Victoria: "…"

I just want to die!

By a strange twist of fate,

The restaurant Victoria chose happened to be the same one Sophia brought her parents to.

Their tables were adjacent.

The Western restaurant's booths were semi-private.

Neighboring tables could even hear the clinking of cutlery.

Let alone conversation.

The server brought a tablet to take their order.

Deborah had never had Western food.

She instinctively looked at her son.

Tyson wasn't looking at the menu.

Nor at his mother.

His eyes were glued lecherously to the tall, curvaceous server.

Extremely creepy.

The server endured the discomfort.

She took two steps back.

Standing further away.

Deborah completely missed her son's intentions.

Even if she had noticed, she wouldn't have cared.

It was just looking.

No skin off her nose.

The curly English script on the menu gave her a headache.

She couldn't be bothered to ask Victoria.

She just pointed randomly.

She ordered whatever picture looked good.

She didn't understand appetizers, mains, or desserts.

When the food finally arrived,

There were few hot dishes.

Mostly appetizers and desserts.

Under the server's strange stare,

Deborah urged her son.

They happily started eating.

Victoria: "…"

She just wanted to cover her face and run away.

Someone save me!

Sophia had noticed who was next door long ago.

But so what?

Her energy was limited.

She had no time to pay attention to strangers.

"Dad, try my Beef Wellington. It's the signature dish. Tastes pretty good…"

She cut a piece.

And forked it onto David's plate.

Isabella protested. "Why only for your dad?"

Sophia sighed. "I wanted to give some to my dear mother too, but Mrs. Isabella Sullivan doesn't like food others have touched, I have to be careful, right?"

Isabella had her little quirks.

But—

"Is my daughter 'others'?"

Sophia quickly served her a piece of steak.

Bigger and more tender than David's.

Isabella: "That's more like it…"

Olivia watched their family of three.

A flash of envy in her eyes.

Although Deborah and Tyson had impressive appetites,

They still left a lot.

She asked Victoria, "Aren't you going to eat?"

Victoria really wanted to reply: Looking at you kills my appetite, how could I eat?

But the words that came out were: "I'm not hungry. I need to use the restroom."

As she stood up,

She heard the laughter and cheerful conversation from next door.

David and Isabella ate elegantly.

They sat with ease and composure.

Victoria's heart soured with intense jealousy.

And regret.

What on earth had blinded her?

To make her reject Sophia Sullivan.

And choose Isabella Langley?

And end up with such a bizarre family!
###Chapter 188

Olivia Lopez received a call and hurriedly left.

Sophia Sullivan brought her parents home.

David Sullivan scrolled through photos on his phone with great enthusiasm.

"Look at this gold-bodied painted enamel cup and saucer set... and this silver-inlaid coral neckpiece..."

His voice echoed in the stairwell.

Isabella Sullivan couldn't help but smile at his childlike excitement.

Sophia listened quietly, occasionally offering a brief response.

The three reached the seventh floor. Sophia took out her keys to open the door.

The door across the hall suddenly opened.

"Alexander, heading out?" David greeted warmly.

Sophia turned and met Alexander Laurent's smiling eyes.

He wore a crisp white short-sleeved shirt with khaki casual trousers, looking clean and sharp.

This was their first meeting since the incident when she was drunk.

Remembering her father's remark about her causing a scene with Alexander while intoxicated...

Sophia guiltily averted her gaze.

The man's smile widened. He nodded to David. "Heading to the lab."

"Working this late?"

"Still have data to process."

"Let's play chess another day."

"Sure."

…

Victoria Roscente finally freed herself from Deborah Melville and her son.

They had tired themselves out and returned to their hotel, allowing her to escape.

Back at the old mansion, she collapsed onto the sofa, completely drained.

"Mom! Great news—"

Amelia Roscente ran down the stairs.

She had received her acceptance letter from MIT.

Major: Bioinformatics.

Advisor: Professor Victoria Lowell.

All those gifts of bird's nest and ginseng hadn't been wasted.

They were originally intended for Professor Eleanor Watson but had been rejected.

Putting rejected gifts to good use worked perfectly.

She had also arranged for someone to deliver a jadeite bangle worth a million to Professor Lowell.

She didn't deliver it personally fearing its high value might make the professor refuse it.

She also worried about being photographed.

Just like how she had once photographed Alexander Laurent and Sophia Sullivan.

She ultimately chose to conduct the transaction through an intermediary.

The bangle was "sold" to Professor Lowell for five hundred dollars.

Gold has a price, but jade is priceless.

No one could ever prove anything.

Professor Lowell certainly didn't disappoint her.

Victoria lay sprawled on the sofa. Upon hearing the news, she merely lifted her eyelids. "That's wonderful."

"Mom, why do you seem so listless? Where did you go today?"

Victoria immediately sat up. "Cleaning up your brother's mess! That mother and son are simply... being seen with them is embarrassing!"

Amelia frowned. "Who told you to spoil them like that? People will take a mile if you give an inch."

"What else could I do? Your father and your brother won't handle it. I just hope they take the money and disappear, never to show up again!"

Victoria thought of encountering Sophia Sullivan's family today...

She stared at the crystal chandelier and murmured, "Knowing what I know now, maybe accepting Sophia Sullivan would have been better..."

At least there wouldn't be an insufferable mother and younger brother.

Amelia sighed. "Yeah..."

If they had accepted Sophia back then, her and Ethan Roscente's child would be old enough to run errands by now.

She also wouldn't be jumping out to compete for a graduate position.

What a pity...

Hindsight is always twenty-twenty.

There are no regrets in this world.

…

Olivia Lopez left the western restaurant after receiving the call.

She paid the bill on her way out.

She warned Sophia Sullivan, "This meal is my treat for your parents. Don't you dare try to pay."

Then she hurried off.

Half an hour later, her car stopped outside Blue Maple Entertainment.

A young man stood by the revolving door. Seeing her car, he immediately stepped forward, opened the passenger door, and got in.

"Baby, you're finally here."

The man was Dylan, a minor celebrity who got his start acting in short dramas.

He had fair skin, stood 6'1", and had excellent looks. His clingy, personality made him the perfect "puppy dog" type Olivia adored.

"You called so urgently. What's wrong?"

Dylan pursed his lips. "My manager set up a dinner. I'm scared... Can you come with me?"

His eyes were red-rimmed as he spoke.

His fair skin made the redness more pronounced. He looked at her cautiously. Olivia was completely disarmed.

"Okay, I'll go with you. Don't be afraid."

"Olivia, you're the best..." The puppy dog smiled through his tears.

Olivia's heart softened. She touched his chin. "Why are you such a crybaby?"

"I am not!"

…

The car stopped outside a private club.

Olivia frowned at the large characters reading "The Oasis Club."

She had never been here but had heard of it.

Extremely private. Bar and dance floor downstairs. Private dining and meeting rooms upstairs. Also offered accommodation services.

Those in the know, knew.

"Your manager arranged to meet here?"

"Yeah. Manager Wang said he's negotiating a supporting male lead role in a blockbuster IP series for me."

They went up to a private room on the second floor. Olivia noticed Dylan's manager wasn't there.

The table was filled with big investors.

There were also a few familiar faces—

Charlie Lowell nudged Julian Winston's shoulder. "Isn't that your official girlfriend? Who's the guy with her? Looks familiar..."

He soon remembered.

This was the male lead from two hit short dramas he had invested in.

Dylan... something?

Dylan put his arm around Olivia and led her to the table, pulling out a chair for her. "Sit, Olivia."

"Where's your manager?"

Dylan's eyes shifted evasively. "Manager Wang said he's stuck in traffic. Probably still on his way."

Olivia raised an eyebrow and looked directly across the table.

Julian Winston sat there with a face like thunder, as if someone owed him millions. His gaze towards her was icy enough to freeze hell.
###Chapter 189

Dammably Alluring

Dylan sat down quietly next to Olivia.

He picked up his wine glass and began proposing toasts one by one.

"My apologies for being late. Bottom's up."

After three glasses, he continued smilingly around the table.

The seat of honor was occupied by Mr. Sterling, the owner of JoyRite Entertainment.

He was a famous capital magnate in the entertainment industry.

Mr. Sterling's gaze fell on Olivia.

"When did Vivi become interested in the entertainment industry?"

"Just dabbling for fun."

"Need any help?" Mr. Sterling ignored Dylan's toast.

"Thank you, Uncle Sterling. I don't know much about this business."

Mr. Sterling was good friends with Olivia's father.

Her address of 'uncle' came naturally.

Dylan's eyes flickered.

He went from surprise to comprehension in an instant.

No wonder Manager Wang insisted he bring Olivia.

So that was the connection.

"Mr. Sterling, Vivi really doesn't care for the entertainment world. She says some things are best admired from a distance."

"Haha, that does sound like something this girl would say. And you are?"

Mr. Sterling finally looked at him properly.

"My name is Dylan. I'm an artist with Blue Maple Entertainment. I debuted two years ago, no major works yet."

"Hmm, quite honest."

"I wouldn't dare be presumptuous in front of you."

Olivia watched them clink glasses and drink.

She found it rather dull.

She wanted to leave, so she stood up.

"Sorry, something came up suddenly. I have to go."

Mr. Sterling didn't spoil the mood and indulged her instead.

"Go on. I'll arrange tea with your father another day."

"Okay."

Dylan's face fell. He excused himself to the restroom and chased after her.

"Vivi—"

Olivia stopped and turned around.

"Yes?"

"Why are you so cold to me?"

His eyes reddened on cue. The tears came readily.

This time, Olivia felt nothing.

"You don't know the reason?"

"What did I do wrong?" He looked utterly innocent.

Olivia let out a cold laugh, looking him up and down.

Dylan grew uneasy under her scrutiny.

But in his mind, Olivia was still that soft-hearted, doting sugar mommy who spent money on him.

He shouldn't be afraid.

There was no need to be afraid.

"Dylan," Olivia suddenly called his name, "do you understand the rules?"

"...What?"

"I pamper you. I spend money on you. I grant your every wish. In return, you are to be loyal, well-behaved, and know your place."

"Vivi..."

"If you want resources or connections, you can ask outright. I'll give them if I'm pleased. But—"

She lifted her chin, her eyes icy.

"You do not get to scheme against me. Understood?"

"It's like a dog I keep. It wags its tail when hungry, and I feed it. But if it tries to snatch food, it's not a good dog."

Dylan swayed on his feet. "I didn't... It was Manager Wang..."

"What he said isn't important. You were the one who brought me to this dinner. You used me to talk to Uncle Sterling. Was that also taught by Manager Wang?"

"Vivi, let me explain... I was scared to come to this kind of dinner alone, that's why I asked you to accompany me..."

"Scared? You seemed to be working the room quite adeptly, enjoying yourself thoroughly. That's called scared?"

"I..."

Dylan was speechless.

"This ends here. Let's pretend we don't know each other if we meet again." Olivia turned to leave.

Suddenly—

"Think you can just dump me?" The man's voice turned sinister. "You think it's that easy?"

Olivia looked back.

The sunny, puppy-like young man she remembered now wore a vicious expression.

The greed in his eyes was no longer concealed.

"Two million. Plus the male lead in that Blockbuster IP Series. Then we're even."

Olivia laughed, stepping closer to him.

"Negotiating with me?"

Dylan gritted his teeth. "You could say that."

"Are you worthy? What qualifications do you have?"

"Our intimate photos. Are they qualification enough?"

Olivia wasn't afraid. She smiled even more brilliantly.

"If I don't agree, you'll release them?"

"Correct."

"Fine. Then go ahead and release them."

"You—" Dylan was shocked.

Olivia: "My figure and face aren't bad. I'm presentable anywhere. But you? Once those photos are out, can you handle the scandal of being a kept man?"

"I don't care. I'm not in the entertainment industry. But you? Do you not want to be a star anymore?"

Two sentences. She had him by the throat.

The man's expression shifted several times before reverting to his puppy-dog look.

"Vivi, I'm sorry, I was wrong. Please don't abandon me..."

Olivia curled her lip and raised her hand to pat his cheek.

Her gaze was cruel and merciless.

"When I like you, I can pamper, love, and indulge you. When I don't, I will loathe and discard you like trash. These are the rules. Remember?"

"If you want to survive in this circle, know your place."

"To put it nicely, I'm your patron. To put it bluntly, you're my dog."

"Does a dog that dares to bite its master know its fate?" She enunciated each word slowly. "S-k-i-n-n-e-d a-l-i-v-e. F-l-a-y-e-d."

With every word, the man's face grew paler.

By the end, he was trembling all over, sweating profusely.

So the upper crust weren't fools.

How laughable that he thought he could control her.

Olivia was satisfied with his reaction.

She gave a light laugh and strode away.

After she left, a figure emerged from the shadows.

The cigarette between his fingers had burned to the end.

He dropped it on the ground and crushed it under his foot.

Julian Winston watched the direction the woman had left.

His gaze was deep and unfathomable like a dark pool.

Tsk. How ruthless.

Even more decisive than when he dumps women.

Yet it was—

Dammably alluring.
###Chapter 190

A faint smile touched Julian Winston's lips as he followed her.

His girlfriend just went through a breakup. He ought to show some concern.

...

Dylan returned to the private room, utterly dejected.
He forced a smile and continued toasting the executives.
Olivia Lopez had dumped him and wasn't swayed by his threats. This dinner was his last chance.

"...Mr. Sterling, I've long admired your reputation. Finally, I have the honor to toast you today. I hope for your guidance in the future."

In the past, he wouldn't even have been allowed near such an occasion, let alone offer a toast.

Charlie Lowell casually crossed his arms. "Your name was...?"
"Dylan."
"Right, Dylan. You can hold your liquor?"
"You flatter me, Mr. Lowell. I can manage a few glasses."
"I heard you're angling for the supporting male lead in that blockbuster IP series Mr. Sterling is holding?"
Dylan tensed. "What are you suggesting, Mr. Lowell?"
"Giving it to you isn't out of the question. Right, Mr. Sterling?"
Mr. Sterling raised an eyebrow. He didn't know what game Charlie was playing, but he played along. "Of course."
Hope flickered in Dylan's eyes.
Charlie: "There's a small condition, though. Simple for you."
"Please, go ahead."
"Finish every last drop of alcohol on this table, and the role is yours."

The room instantly filled with amused, expectant looks.

Dylan's face fell. "Mr. Lowell, you're making this difficult."
"Exactly. I am. Don't drink if you don't want to. We'll find someone else."

The table was laden with drinks.
Red wine, white liquor, beer.
Drinking it all would leave him half-dead.

Dylan hesitated for only three seconds.
"I'll drink."

Charlie applauded. "Excellent."

As Dylan tilted his head back and started guzzling, Charlie took out his phone and texted Julian.

[Did what you asked.]
[All because the guy put his arm around your girlfriend's shoulder?]
[I thought it was a fake relationship? An open arrangement? Can't handle it?]

The messages got no reply.

At that moment, Julian was following Olivia into a bar.

Unbelievable.
She dumps her boy-toy and immediately comes here to party, happy as can be.

A man approached her, trying to chat her up.
Olivia gave him a quick once-over.
"Too old. Not interested." She dismissed him and walked away.

The man stood frozen, his face darkening with anger.

Julian, sitting in a booth, was laughing so hard he could barely sit up.

"What's so funny?" Olivia came over from the dance floor and kicked his shoe. "That hilarious?"
"Pretty hilarious."
"You're about as old as he is."
"?"
"Laughing at him is like laughing at yourself."
"??"

Her comebacks were always precise.

Olivia sat down and poured herself a drink.
She'd just finished dancing. Her skin was still damp with sweat, her breathing slightly quickened.
The feeling of letting loose was utterly satisfying.

"Why'd you follow me? Dinner over?" she asked casually.
"Boring. When did you spot me?"
"Saw you as soon as I walked in. Need something?"
Julian swirled his glass, a teasing smile playing on his lips. "Worried the dog you raised might bite you, and you'd hide away crying."
"Pfft—That? You think I'm that fragile?"
"Aren't all women a bit delicate?"
"You're wrong about that. I can't speak for others, but me—my heart is hard as iron."

Julian couldn't help but laugh again.
"Tch, why do you keep laughing?" Olivia complained.
"Should I cry instead?"
"Go ahead. I'll pass you a tissue."
"..."

Julian pulled out his lighter.
Olivia held out her hand.
He handed it over, thinking she'd light his cigarette for him. Instead—

Smack!
She slapped his hand away. "I want a cigarette! Why are you giving me the lighter? You're so clueless..."

Julian: "?"
He lit his own cigarette first, learning his lesson this time. He leaned over and lit hers for her.

The flame flared, illuminating her face.
She lowered her head, her red lips closing around the filter, leaving a faint lipstick mark.

Julian was momentarily mesmerized.
"Hey, put it out."
"...Right." He pocketed the lighter.

They stayed at the bar for two hours, finishing a bottle of dry red. It was past midnight when they left.
Both had been drinking and couldn't drive.

Olivia tried to book a driver. The app showed 36 people ahead of her.
She stared at the screen.
"Don't bother. At this hour, on this street, waiting an hour would be lucky."
"Then I'll get a cab and pick up the car tomorrow."
But—
The taxi queue was even worse!

Olivia was completely defeated. Suddenly, an idea struck her. "How are you getting back?"
Julian: "I'm not."
"What do you mean?"
"See that hotel across the street?"
Olivia nodded. "Yeah. So?"
"It's mine."
"And?"
Julian: "Why not just stay at the hotel? Going home is a hassle."

Olivia's eyes lit up with understanding. "Makes sense. I'll stay here tonight."
"Ahem—"
What did she mean, 'stay here'?
Julian nearly choked.

Olivia had more.
"What are you standing around for? Let's go! Get a room!"

Laughing, she crossed the street. The night breeze lifted her hair. Long legs, a slender waist, carefree and radiant.

Julian hurried after her. "Hey! Slow down! Watch for cars!"

At the hotel front desk, Julian said, "Get her a room."
"Right away, sir."
Olivia: "What about you? Not getting one?"
Julian: "I have a permanent suite here."
He could stay anytime.
"Then get me one too."
Julian laughed in disbelief. "You really don't stand on ceremony?"
"As your officially recognized girlfriend, shouldn't I have at least that much privilege at your own hotel? Aren't you embarrassed otherwise?"
She was utterly unapologetic.
"Fine," Julian wasn't stingy. "Reserve a permanent suite for her."
The same compensation as his.

Olivia smiled. "That's more like it..."

They took their key cards to the top floor. Their rooms were opposite each other. They swiped in and went their separate ways.

Julian finished his shower and was about to turn in when a knock came at the door.
"Sir, this is Danielle, she's new." The hotel manager smiled, leading a woman in.
"Danielle, be attentive. Take good care of Mr. Winston."
"Yes, Manager." The woman spoke with shy, demure sweetness, her voice dripping with honey.

Julian: "?"

###Chapter 191

Julian frowned deeply.

He wasn't in the mood tonight.

"No need. Take her away."

The manager's smile didn't falter. He shot Danielle a look.

They both retreated quickly.

At the end of the hallway—

Danielle: "I thought you said the young master always wanted company when he came here?"

Manager: "Normally, yes. But today's an exception. You think men only check into hotels for one thing?"

"But I..."

She had been waiting for this chance for a long time.

The manager scoffed. "What you want doesn't matter. What matters is what the young master wants. Tough luck. Seems he's already eaten elsewhere, not looking for a snack. Save your energy. Don't flatter yourself."

The woman gritted her teeth in secret.

Inside the suite, Olivia had just finished her bath.

She was drying her hair when a sudden knock came at the door.

Thinking it was Julian—

"What do you want so late... Huh?!"

The person outside wasn't Julian.

A young man offered an awkward smile. "Sorry, wrong door."

"It's fine." Olivia started to close the door.

A hand suddenly pressed against it.

Olivia raised an eyebrow. "Something else?"

"You really don't recognize me?" The man's gaze was wistful, tinged with a hint of hurt.

Olivia laughed, looking him over carefully.

Wrong door? She wasn't buying it.

There were only two suites on the top floor.

One for her, one for Julian.

Dressed like that, he couldn't possibly be here for Julian.

He wore a white T-shirt, light green shorts, and sneakers.

Youthful and vibrant, exactly Olivia's type.

"Chen..."

"Xuhe." He finished for her, not minding at all that she didn't remember his full name.

"Cody, what can I do for you?"

"Dylan really took you to that dinner?"

"What if he did?"

"If he did, then it's time for you to find a new... companion."

Cody and Dylan were from the same company, debuted around the same time. Friendly on the surface, rivals underneath.

Olivia's smile widened. "Swap him for who?"

His eyes lit up. "I'm younger than Dylan. Cleaner. And most importantly... I know the rules."

Rules?

Olivia gave him a once-over.

He was definitely easier on the eyes than Dylan.

"Offering yourself?"

Cody's ears turned red. "If you need someone..."

"Come in."

Olivia turned and walked inside.

The man's heart raced. He followed, gently closing the door behind him.

...

Julian lay in bed, scrolling through his phone.

Wide awake.

He was a little hungry.

He thought about ordering late-night snacks. After a moment's consideration, he went to knock on Olivia's door.

"Ordering some food. Want anything?"

"...No. I'm asleep!"

"Fine." Julian turned away, then paused.

Why did her voice sound breathless?

"Hey, you okay?"

There was no response from inside.

Julian snorted. This woman was reckless and rude!

His appetite gone, he went back to his room to sleep.

The moonlight was hazy, the night deep.

The next morning, Julian woke at nine.

He went to find Olivia.

Just as he reached her door to knock, it opened from the inside.

"Oli—"

Huh!

A young man stood in the doorway, hair slightly disheveled, looking like he'd just woken up.

They stared at each other.

Julian froze.

The man, however, was calm. He gave a slight nod and put a finger to his lips.

"Keep it down. She's still sleeping."

Then, he turned and left.

Julian stood in the hallway for a long moment before it hit him. "Holy—"

Olivia was fooling around right here? In his family's hotel? Right across from him? Under his nose?!

Julian barged in, deliberately slamming the door.

Unfortunately, the hotel door had a silent close mechanism. It didn't make a sound.

Furious, he kicked over a chair. But the carpet was too thick, muffling the noise entirely.

Whoosh!

He yanked the curtains open.

The bright sunlight was blinding. Olivia finally stirred.

"Cody, are you trying to die?!"

She sat up abruptly. The light was too harsh. She could only make out a blurry figure standing by the bed.

Assuming it was Cody, she commanded, "Close the curtains!"

The young miss had a terrible temper upon waking.

Usually, no one dared to provoke her.

Julian let out a cold laugh.

He saw the love bites on her neck and chest, varying in color. Clearly from last night... and this morning...

"Olivia, you've been busy."

The voice made Olivia pause.

She blinked, finally recognizing Julian.

Two seconds later, she quickly pulled the covers up to her chest. "Damn it—You just barge in without knocking?"

"Didn't need to. Someone opened it for me." He looked for a chair to sit on, but they were all overturned.

He had to sit on the edge of the bed. "Quite the achiever, aren't you? Dump one and pick up a new one without missing a beat. Flawless transition!"

"Julian, are you insane? What's wrong with you this morning?"

"Stop speaking in riddles!"

"Then get out! Stop buzzing around here like an annoying fly..."

She pulled the covers over her head and went back to sleep.

"...Close the curtains."

Julian: "?!"

She actually fell asleep again.

When Olivia woke next, the sunlight was softer, and it was quiet.

She sat up and stretched contentedly.

The perks of youth. So much energy.

"Awake?"

Olivia froze. "...You're still here?"

Julian sat in a chair, watching her with a cold expression.

Olivia grabbed a shawl to wrap around herself. She only wore a camisole underneath, the love marks faintly visible.

Julian was about to speak.

She cut him off. "Perfect. Get me a glass of ice water, please. Thanks."

"!"

"The fridge is over there." Seeing him stunned, she pointed. "Can't find things in your own hotel?"

Julian: "!!"
###Chapter 192

Why are you staring at me like that?
Go get me some water.
I'm dying of thirst.

Julian Winston stood up with a dark expression.

The ice water jolted Olivia Lopez fully awake.

"Did you need something? Waiting so long for me... I feel a bit awkward."

While he was getting the water,
she put her clothes on.
She glanced at the time.

It was already 11 AM!

"Awkward? Since when does Miss Olivia Lopez get awkward? You seem perfectly fine to me!"

He exploded.
All his pent-up emotions burst out.

"Ordering me to get water so casually? If you're so capable, why don't you just fly to the moon?"

He even muttered a curse under his breath.

Olivia frowned. "Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed? Why so angry?"

"Who was that guy this morning? Care to explain?"

Olivia was baffled. "Explain what? Do you report every woman you sleep with to someone?"

The man was speechless for a moment. "I'm your boyfriend now! How do you think this makes me look?"

Olivia looked even more confused. "Correction: a fake one. Besides, I'm not fooling around publicly. What I do privately is none of your business."

"We agreed to see other people before this partnership. Did I break the agreement? Why are you yelling at me?"

Julian Winston: "…"

He couldn't win an argument with her!
It was infuriating!

Olivia looked around the room. "Your hotel is nice. Keep this room for me. I'll be back."

"!" There's going to be a next time?!

"Oh, and tell the front desk to give me another key card."

"…What for?"

"One for me, one to give to someone else!"

Wasn't it obvious?
Olivia suspected he was still drunk from last night.

Julian sneered. "Am I your servant? Do I owe you? No!"

He slammed the door on his way out.

Olivia watched his retreating figure.
She was completely bewildered.

After a long moment, she muttered two words—
"Psycho!"

Julian returned to his room.
The door shut with a heavy thud.

He first called the front desk. "Suite 1901. Do not issue any additional key cards! Understood?"

Then he called the manager. "Send ten women over here!"

Manager: "!"
T-ten?!

Danielle was regretting not seizing her chance yesterday.
She immediately volunteered. "I'll go!"

The manager was efficient.
Twenty minutes later.
He led a group of chattering women to the top-floor suite.

"Young Master, they're all here."

Julian glanced toward the opposite door.
He raised his voice. "Is that all ten?"

"Yes, yes, it is." The manager also spoke louder.

"Good! All of you, get in—"

The women swayed their hips into the room.
Giggling and chattering.
It was extremely lively.

The manager tactfully withdrew.
As he walked, he called the front desk. "Is the checkout for 1901 complete? The Young Master ordered the room to be kept long-term. Last night's stay is on his tab…"

"What did you say?"

"Young… Young Master?!"

The manager stared, dumbfounded, at Julian who had rushed out after him.

"What about 1901?"

Manager: "K-keeping the room and putting it on your tab…"

"The sentence before that."

"Young Master's orders…"

"Before that."

Manager: "1901 checkout?"

Julian: "She checked out?!"

"Y-yes, ten minutes ago."

"Damn—"

Manager: "?"

Julian: "Get those women out of here! They're annoying just to look at—"

Manager: "…" That's not what you said a moment ago.

Over here, it was all drama and exciting
A game of hearts pushed to the limit.

But over at Sophia Sullivan's place, it was as routine as ever.

She woke up naturally at seven.
Made breakfast.
Went out to buy groceries.

She returned from the market at nine.
As soon as she entered, she heard David Sullivan exclaim, "…I never expected you to be not only brilliant at research, but also so skilled at gardening!"

She paused while taking off her shoes.
Two seconds later.
A familiar voice came from the balcony. "You flatter me, Uncle."

Alexander Laurent.

Sophia put the groceries in the kitchen.
Poured two cups of the pear soup she had simmered that morning.
Then turned towards the balcony.

David Sullivan and Alexander Laurent sat with their backs to the door.
Each on a small stool.
Seven or eight flowerpots were laid out in front of them.
Soil and plants were piled beside them.

"Dad, Professor, some pear soup."

"You're back, Sophia? I had some free time today, so I'm repotting these. Several had root rot."

He reached out to take a cup.
But noticed his hands were dirty. "Wait, let me wash my hands first."

"Okay."

Alexander was much smarter.
He had worn disposable gloves.

He simply took them off.
And accepted the cup. "Thank you."

Sophia: "When did you get here, Professor?"

"Half an hour ago."

"No lab today?"

Alexander: "I'm going this afternoon."

"Then how did you…" end up at my place?

She didn't finish.
Alexander smiled. "I was coming back from my morning run and ran into your father taking out the trash."

David Sullivan couldn't just let him leave?
Upon learning he was free this morning,
and only going to the lab in the afternoon,
he immediately invited him over.

Alexander went back to shower and change.
He came over shortly after.

"Last time…" Sophia pursed her lips awkwardly. "I was… not myself. I'm sorry."

"Last time which time?" The man raised an eyebrow.

Sophia looked at him.
Unsure if he genuinely forgot or was teasing her.

"That time… when I invited you over for dinner. I had too much to drink, and then…"

Alexander's lips curved. "And then what?"

"I seemed drunk, I don't remember clearly…" what crazy thing I did! Did I offend you!

Alexander saw her embarrassment.
He took pity. "It was fine."

He paused.
Then added, "No big deal."

Aside from insisting on jumping up to knock his head,
finally wrinkling his shirt,
and messing up his hair,
it was nothing.

Sophia let out a long sigh of relief.

"Just… next time, maybe don't grab a man by the collar and ask him if he 'can do it or not'."

Sophia: "!"

The memory came flooding back.

"Let me knock your head! You knocked mine, why can't I knock yours?"

The man dodged helplessly.

But she grabbed his collar and yanked hard.
Their faces almost touched.

Alexander's breath hitched.
The drunk Sophia was completely unaware.
Her only thought was to knock his head in retaliation.

"Just once… can you? Say something! Can you do it or not?!"
###Chapter 193
See Your Uncle Alexander Out

Memories flooded back.

Sophia Sullivan was caught off guard.

That person grabbing a man's collar and making a scene was actually her?

She met Alexander Laurent's amused gaze.

Her toes curled instantly.

She wished she could dig a hole and disappear.

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "Remember now?"

"I'm sorry..."

"Does that even need asking? Of course not. Who wants to be knocked on the head? It's not a wooden fish. Too many knocks will make you stupid."

He said it lightly.

Dispelling her embarrassment.

"Then why did you knock me..." she muttered under her breath.

The cause and effect became clearer.

He had started it.

Alexander became serious. "You can drink, but don't overindulge."

"Okay."

Sophia nodded obediently.

She didn't dare argue.

"What are you talking about?" David Sullivan asked, wiping his hands as he returned.

He picked up the pear soup and drank it all.

Alexander sipped slowly. "We were discussing drinking..."

"By the way, Alexander, stay for lunch. We'll have a couple of drinks. We haven't finished discussing that new nuclear power generation technology..."

Alexander didn't agree immediately.

Instead, he looked at Sophia. "What do you think?"

"Don't... don't drink?"

Alcohol causes trouble.

"The Professor has to go to the lab this afternoon. Dad, you shouldn't drink either. Let's just eat."

David nodded. "Then Alexander really shouldn't drink. Just the two of us will have some."

"Oh?" Alexander raised an eyebrow. "Sophia likes to drink?"

"She does. Just yesterday she said she'd have a couple with me, but her mother stopped her."

Sophia's scalp prickled.

She blinked her eyes furiously.

Her father didn't notice at all.

"But she knows her limits. She just tastes a sip or two occasionally," David added. "Last time was an exception."

Sophia was speechless.

Alexander chuckled softly. "Yes, she certainly calculates everything and knows her limits in all things."

"Hehe..." Her father grinned foolishly.

David cooked lunch again.

He worked efficiently.

Soon the table was full of dishes.

The menu was completely different from last time.

At the table—

"Alexander, eat more, make yourself at home!"

David finished greeting.

He turned to Sophia. "Why didn't you get a glass? I'll go get one—"

"Dad! Don't..." Sophia hurriedly stopped him.

David: "?"

"Alcohol is bad for your health. Let's not drink."

David looked stunned.

What about their private agreement?

Sophia said seriously, "My awareness has improved. Dad, you shouldn't drink either."

David: "..."

"Mom doesn't like you drinking either, right?" Sophia looked at Isabella.

David: "..."

The little cotton-padded jacket was leaking.

After the meal.

Alexander rolled up his sleeves.

He prepared to help clear the dishes.

David quickly stopped him.

"No need, no need, I'll handle it."

Alexander insisted. "You didn't treat me as an outsider when you asked me to stay for a meal. Don't start now."

"Well..."

David was still hesitating.

Alexander had already gathered the dishes and walked into the kitchen.

Isabella looked surprised.

"See? A man as diligent as Alexander is rare. Hehe, just like me. No wonder we get along."

Isabella was speechless.

Praising someone while complimenting himself.

At one in the afternoon.

Alexander prepared to leave.

David was turning soil on the balcony.

He called out without turning his head. "Clara, see your Uncle Alexander out!"

Alexander's steps faltered.

His back stiffened slightly.

Sophia quickly stood up. "Dad, stop messing up the generations! Professor, let me see you out..."

"Okay."

Sophia walked him out.

David muttered under his breath. "Last time she said she would acknowledge him as an uncle..."

...

Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.

David and Isabella stayed in Kyoto.

Sophia felt the time was right.

She prepared to arrange a meeting between Isabella and Stone Macmillan.

"Mom, there's another reason I invited you to Kyoto this time."

"What is it?"

Sophia took out a document folder and pushed it over.

"This is your contract with Editor Moore. I had publishing professionals and an intellectual property lawyer look at it..."

Isabella's heart tightened.

Sophia motioned for her to open it.

"The parts marked in red are all unreasonable clauses. This publishing house is actually a studio controlled by Editor Moore..."

It wasn't even a legitimate publishing house.

A legitimate publishing house has proper qualifications.

It can publish reading materials with ISBNs.

This studio could only deal in illustrated merchandise, audiobooks, and e-books.

No wonder Isabella hadn't had a new book published in ten years.

It wasn't that she couldn't write.

It was that Editor Moore couldn't get her published.

That's why every beginning and outline was rejected.

"If she couldn't get it published, why did she sign your mother back then? And for ten years?"

Isabella was completely stunned.

David was relatively calmer.

He raised the key question.

When Editor Moore signed Isabella back then.

She paid a after-tax signing fee of 200,000.

200,000 was a significant amount ten years ago.

Why would she be willing to pay so much without an expected return?

Sophia pointed to the third page of the contract.

"The second big trap is here. Party A grants Party B exclusive agency rights for all copyrights of its published works.... The split ratio is on the attached page... Where is the attached page?"

David looked down carefully.

Sophia shook her head. "There is no attached page."

David was shocked.

This meant the contract didn't stipulate the royalty split for previously published books.

Editor Moore could give it all.

Or she could give nothing.

Isabella said softly, "In these ten years, I've only received royalties five times. The most was eighty thousand, the least five thousand."

Sophia's heart sank.

It was cruel.

But her mother needed to know the truth.

"I checked the domestic publishing sales rankings for the past ten years. 'The Weapon' and 'The Deserted Village School' were consistently in the top 20."

Isabella nodded. "I asked Editor Moore. She said the publishing market was shrinking, sales were declining, so royalties naturally decreased."

Sophia pondered. "The domestic publishing industry indeed it had encountered a winter chill. But that might not be the whole reason. Did she ever mention the overseas sales of 'The Weapon' and 'The Deserted Village School'?"
###Chapter 194

News arrived from the overseas market.

"Both 'The Weapon' and 'The Deserted Village School' have strong electronic and physical sales in Southeast Asia."

Isabella Sullivan was stunned. "I didn't know these books were released overseas..."

"I've estimated the revenue from these two books over the years to be at least this much." Sophia Sullivan held up five fingers.

David Sullivan guessed, "Five hundred thousand?"

"Dad, think bigger."

"...Five million?"

Sophia shook her head. "Seven point two million USD." And that was a conservative estimate.

David sucked in a sharp breath.

"Mom," Sophia sat beside Isabella and took her hand, "The past can't be changed. Your ten-year contract with Editor Moore is over."

"The most important thing now is to reclaim the lost time. I know what pains you most is your work being buried. How many productive decades does a writer have?"

Isabella turned away, her shoulders trembling slightly.

"I sent your completed but unpublished manuscripts to an editor. You should meet with him..."

Isabella took a deep breath. "Okay."

That night, soft weeping came from the second bedroom.

It was accompanied by a man's gentle comfort.

Sophia lay awake, staring at the ceiling all night.

...

The next day, the three of them went to a coffee shop.

The café was quiet in the afternoon.

A Ragdoll cat napped on the front counter.

A man with a square jaw sat by the window.

He wore black-framed glasses, a white shirt, and casual pants, exuding a scholarly air.

He was gazing out the window, waiting.

Hearing the doorbell chime, he turned and immediately stood to approach Isabella.

"Hello, Ms. Sullivan. I'm Stone Macmillan, an editor from Decagon Publishing."

He nodded in greeting to Sophia and David.

"Shall we talk? We'll wait outside?" Sophia asked.

Isabella nodded.

Stone pulled out a chair for her and thoughtfully placed an order.

Isabella only asked for lemon water.

She had been in a daze since yesterday.

A decade of trust had been wasted, and she didn't know who to blame.

Stone got straight to the point. "Ms. Sullivan, I wonder if you'd be interested in publishing these four books: 'The Lantern,' 'The Curse,' 'The Ancestral Grave,' and 'Ming Dynasty Ghost Hunters'?"

Isabella was stunned.

Had she heard correctly?

Stone offered an apologetic smile. "I know this is presumptuous, but after reviewing the works, this is the publishing house's decision."

"Before meeting you, I prepared many persuasive arguments. But now, I believe being direct is most appropriate."

These were all manuscripts Editor Moore had rejected.

Isabella had finished them out of sheer stubbornness.

She had dreamed of publishing mystery novels again.

She had approached Editor Moore multiple times, only to be put off with various excuses.

Now, someone was telling her they could be published.

And—

Stone continued, "If you agree, we will immediately apply for ISBNs, contact printers and media. We estimate publication can be completed within two months."

"We have a preliminary offer for the advance and royalty rate. You are welcome to provide your input..."

Stone was well-prepared.

The advance and royalty percentage were very generous.

He had even brought a contract.

Isabella moved from shock to calm.

"Mr. Macmillan," she took a deep breath, "I apologize..."

Stone's heart sank.

Isabella said, "The terms are very generous, but I need time to think clearly..."

After being stuck in a rut for ten years, Isabella was now wary of everyone.

Editor Moore had seemed very sincere when she first approached all those years ago.

And look how that turned out.

She was afraid of repeating the same mistake.

Stone masked his disappointment. "Ms. Sullivan, I understand how you feel. But I believe, as a mystery writer, you are more rational and clear-headed than most."

"Here is my card. If you change your mind, I hope Decagon Publishing will be your first choice."

"Thank you." Isabella accepted the card.

Stone slid a USB drive across the table. "This contains the proofread electronic manuscripts. Even if you decide not to publish now, having the proofed copies might be useful later."

"They're already proofread?" Isabella was shocked.

Stone's expression turned serious. "My apologies, we did it without your permission..."

"Why? If I refuse, your work would be wasted."

Stone replied, "But if you agree? The proofreading saves half a month."

Isabella asked, "Aren't you afraid of losing money?"

Stone said, "All investments carry risk. Victory and defeat are both common in business."

Victory and defeat are both common in business?

Isabella was taken aback.

"Ms. Sullivan," Stone stood and extended his hand, "I hope we have the opportunity to work together in the future."

Isabella looked at his hand, lost in thought.

Stone did not rush her.

Just as he was about to withdraw his hand, Isabella suddenly spoke. "All four books together?"

Stone was momentarily speechless.

Then, surprise flashed in his eyes.

"You've been silent in the mystery genre for a decade, but with 'The Weapon' and 'The Deserted Village School' as your foundation, your market appeal remains. We shouldn't act unless we can make a big impact. To attract attention, we must truly astonish..."
###Chapter 195
Sophia Sullivan and David Sullivan sat outside the coffee shop.

Through the floor-to-ceiling window, they couldn't hear the conversation.

Isabella Sullivan's expression shifted from dazed to serious, then to apologetic.

Clearly, the talk was not going well.

Stone Macmillan had already stood up, ready to leave.

Isabella suddenly looked up and said something.

Stone's entire demeanor brightened.

He sat back down.

The two continued their discussion.

This time, Isabella was clearly speaking more.

Her previously wooden expression regained its spark.

When it ended, Stone extended his hand again.

"Professor Sullivan, I wish us a pleasant cooperation."

Isabella stood and shook his hand.

"Thank you. The conversation would have been much smoother if you had shown me the proofread manuscript from the start."

Stone shook his head.

"Words are sacred. They can tell stories, express emotions, and celebrate beauty. But they should not be used as a tool for moral coercion."

Isabella sighed softly.

"You are a good editor. I hope this time..."

She would not misjudge someone again.

On the way home, Sophia asked for her impression.

"Down-to-earth, sincere, genuine."

"Did you reach an agreement?"

"Yes. I had originally given up hope. But his sincerity made it hard to refuse. It can't get worse than now. We should give each other a chance."

After arriving home, Sophia looked over the contract.

She suddenly gasped.

Isabella looked over.

David immediately moved closer.

"Is there a trap?"

Sophia shook her head.

Not only was there no trap, the contract was quite equitable.

It even leaned in Isabella's favor.

Most importantly—

This contract was for the person, not the book.

Stone broke the convention of signing works, not people.

He had signed Isabella Sullivan.

Her parents only relaxed after everything was explained.

Sophia sent Stone's profile to Isabella.

It covered everything from basic info to signed works and hit IPs.

Isabella was stunned after reading it.

"...He's that impressive?"

Sophia only replied with four words.

"Top of the industry."

The next day, Isabella received the copyright payment.

David counted the digits.

"Ones, tens, hundreds, thousands... Two million?!"

This was just the print royalty for four books.

There would be additional shares for reprints or derivative copyright sales.

Isabella hadn't expected Stone to move so fast.

It was as if he was afraid she would change her mind.

Sophia was also surprised.

"Mom, you're amazing?"

Isabella blushed.

"I didn't expect it either…"

She didn't think she was worth that much.

They had agreed on one million yesterday.

The amount had doubled.

Just then, Stone called.

"Professor Sullivan, did you receive the money?"

"...Yes. Why is the amount different?"

"One million is the print royalty. Another five hundred thousand is what I negotiated for. The remaining five hundred thousand is the adaptation share for 'The Lantern' short series."

"Short series adaptation? The copyright was sold before the book is even published?"

"Yes. This is your influence."

Isabella had never considered that she had influence.

She thought Stone was just being polite.

That night, Sophia's bank account received two million.

She stared at the balance notification, stunned.

She immediately threw off the covers and ran to her parents' bedroom.

"Mom, why did you transfer money to me?"

Isabella and David exchanged a look.

It was as if they had anticipated this reaction.

"Your father and I discussed it. You spent so much money on the villa. We couldn't help before. Now we can. It's not enough, but it can help a little."

"I don't need the money!"

"I know." Isabella's voice was warm and smiling. "It's not because you need money. The villa is for your father and me to live in. It's only right to share the cost when we have extra money."

"We're family. We don't need to split things so clearly."

"I agree with that. So why are you splitting it so clearly now?"

Checkmated, Sophia was speechless.

"But…"

"Enough." David cut her off. "Listen to your mother's arrangements. Would you refuse us if we needed money in the future?"

Sophia pressed her lips together.

"...No."

"Then it's settled. It's late. You have to catch the high-speed train tomorrow. Go to sleep."

"...I'll keep the money for now. Take it whenever you need it."

"Okay, go on."

Sophia turned and went back to her room.

Isabella sighed softly.

"That silly girl is definitely overthinking it."

David shook his head.

"I don't think Sophia cares about that money…"

He had an inkling his daughter controlled considerable funds.

He hadn't asked for the exact amount, but it was no less than eight figures.

Isabella said seriously, "No matter how much she has, it's hers. No matter how little we give, it's our intention. It's not about the amount. We didn't let our daughter live in a villa when she was young. Now we're benefiting by living in a nice house. That's not taken for granted."

David sighed.

"It's my fault…"

"You are useful."

"Honey…" David was suddenly moved.

"Without you, I couldn't have had a child alone. There would be no Sophia."

"?"

The next morning at nine.

Sophia took her parents to the high-speed train station.

She stood at the gate and watched them walk away.

She didn't leave until their figures were completely out of sight.

Back home, she ran into Alexander Laurent.

He was holding a stack of materials and about to knock.

"Professor." Sophia finished climbing the last step.

Alexander looked up.

"Is your father home?"

"My parents left today. Did you need something from him?"

"The paper he asked me to find last time. I printed it out." He patted the materials in his hand.

"Ah? They just left…"

"It's fine. I have the electronic version. I'll send it to you to forward to him later."

"Thank you, Professor! Sorry for the trouble!"

"Don't mention it. Your father… is a very interesting man."

Except for one thing—insisting on becoming sworn brothers.

With her parents gone, Sophia's life returned to its two-point routine.

She went between home and the library every day.

Time passed quickly.

Soon, it was September.

The day for graduate school orientation arrived…
###Chapter 196

Morning light filtered through the gap in the curtains.

Sophia Sullivan woke up early.

She went to the registrar's office first to check in.

Then she proceeded to the school to complete her enrollment procedures.

The opening ceremony was scheduled for the next day.

Since she wasn't living on campus, she avoided the hassle of moving into a dorm.

Her afternoon was free.

She decided to go to the School of Information to find Professor Benjamin Murphy.

"Sophia?" Professor Murphy's eyes lit up. "What brings you here?"

"I came to see you. To prevent someone from blaming me for not visiting, throwing a tantrum, and deliberately testing me with questions that turn out to be for the final exam."

"Ahem!" Professor Murphy cleared his throat lightly. "That was me making the most of the questions! Waste not, want not!"

They chatted for a while.

Midway through, Sophia received a call from Professor Eleanor Watson.

She was asked to come to her office.

Sophia had to say her goodbyes.

"Eleanor called you?"

"Yes."

Professor Murphy hummed lightly. "Knew it was her. Watching so closely, as if afraid someone will snatch you away."

Sophia arrived outside Professor Watson's office.

She could hear voices inside before even entering.

She stopped and raised her hand to knock.

"Sophia's here? Come in." Professor Watson smiled and waved her in. "Perfect timing. You three should get to know each other."

Professor Watson had accepted three graduate students this year.

Sophia was one of them.

The other two were a man and a woman.

The man was Marcus Lawrence, 22, a local from Kyoto, admitted through a guaranteed graduate program.

He was 180cm tall, handsome, the typical good-looking guy you'd see on campus.

But his expression was cold, exuding an air of detachment.

Hannah Morse, sitting opposite, was the complete opposite.

She had a round face, a healthy glow, and grinned at Sophia, revealing two small dimples.

She was a bit plump but very cute.

"Everyone acquainted? I hope you'll work well together for the next three years. If not... it might be tricky, as there won't be any other options..."

Sophia's heart stirred.

Professor Watson sighed softly. "I'm getting older, my health is declining. I've already applied to the school to stop accepting graduate students."

The three of them would be Professor Watson's last students.

If she hadn't been waiting for Sophia, she would have stopped recruiting years ago.

A person's energy is limited.

Especially for an academic like Professor Watson, who is getting older, in poor health, and dedicated to her research.

Supervising students distracted and affected academic work.

But she persevered for Sophia...

Meeting her teacher's kind gaze, Sophia pressed her lips together.

She had returned too late...

But thankfully, she had returned...

Midway through, Professor Watson received a phone call and left the office.

The three newly acquainted students remained in the room, the atmosphere slightly awkward.

A rustling sound broke the silence, and a box of biscuits was offered to Sophia.

Hannah: "Chocolate flavor. I've tried them; they're not too sweet. Want one?"

Sophia's focus, however, was elsewhere—

"Are you from Guangdong Province?"

Hannah wailed: "Is my accent that obvious, ah?"

Sophia paused: "...Maybe my ears are just sharp?"

"Wuwu... Sister Sophia, you're so nice."

It wasn't her accent; it was Sophia's sharp ears.

Marcus spoke up quietly: "Oh, then maybe my ears are sharp too."

Hannah: "...?"

Sophia took a biscuit: "Thank you."

"How is it? Good?"

She looked at Sophia, eyes full of expectation, like a child seeking praise.

Sophia: "It's good. Not too sweet."

"See? I've tried many brands; this one is the best!"

After a moment's thought, Hannah looked at Marcus—

"Would you like one?"

Marcus: "No, thank you. Too high in calories. Easy to gain weight."

He swore he didn't mean it sarcastically; he was just watching his diet while working out lately.

However—

Hannah, 160cm tall and weighing 145 pounds: "!"

What did the new classmate mean?

Could they even get along?!

Sophia spoke up in time: "Hannah, could I have another one?"

Hannah immediately scooted closer, like a wronged big dog. "Sister Sophia, you're the best to me."

Marcus: "?"

Soon the packet of biscuits was finished.

Sophia had three pieces; Hannah devoured the rest.

So there was a reason the kid was so healthy.

Loved to eat and laugh, cheerful and plump.

Just then, Professor Watson returned with their school IDs and student cards.

"It's 5:30. How about we all go to the cafeteria for dinner?"

The three naturally had no objections.

...

With many people, they opted for stir-fried dishes.

The fifth floor of the cafeteria had private rooms with large round tables seating about ten.

Considering Hannah was from Guangdong, Sophia specifically ordered a sweet dish when choosing the food.

Hannah's eyes started sparkling with little stars again when she looked at Sophia.

Marcus didn't like to talk and had no particular preferences or dietary restrictions, so Sophia left him be.

Mindful of Professor Watson's taste, Sophia picked two more dishes she liked and could eat.

Two meat dishes, two vegetable dishes, and a soup—she had taken care of all four people present.

After eating, Professor Watson paid with her meal card: "This one's on me."

None of the three argued.

As they were leaving, they ran into another group coming out of the room across the hall.

Professor Victoria Lowell was surrounded by five students, like the center of attention, her laughter audible from afar.

The moment she saw Professor Watson, her smile froze, then quickly reappeared as she walked over with her students.

"Eleanor, having dinner with your students?"

Professor Watson's expression was neutral. "Yes."

"I heard you applied to stop accepting students?"

It was true; Professor Watson had nothing to deny.

"What a pity. Students are like bamboo shoots; they need to sprout in batches to continuously produce results. Look at you, only three this year..."

Her gaze swept over Sophia, Marcus, and Hannah. "...and no more after this. It's not just a gap; it's like the field has gone barren entirely."

Her eyes shifted, as if deliberately showing off. "Here, let me introduce them. These five are my new graduate students this year: Ashley Lowell, Jude Granger, Shane Holloway, Amelia Roscente, and Fiona Valentine."

"We're all in the same school, same major. We'll run into each other in the teaching buildings and labs. 
###Chapter 197

Better to get familiar early."

"Tsk..." Hannah inhaled sharply.

Only Sophia, standing closest to her, heard it: "What's wrong?"
Hannah Morse  lowered her voice. "This Ashley Lowell... she's not simple."

Clara turned her head. "How so?"

"I joined the freshman group chat. She's the most discussed person in there."

Top student at her previous university.

Her GPA wasn't high enough for guaranteed graduate admission, but she published six SCI papers as an undergraduate.

The department made an exception to accept her.

They call her the "Prodigy Girl" and the "Academic Rising Star."

"So you must be Professor Eleanor Watson. I've heard so much about you." One of the five, a boy, spoke with a cheeky grin.

Hannah Morse  frowned. "That's Shane Holloway. The admin of the freshman group chat. He spends twenty-two out of twenty-four hours spamming the chat. His mouth is particularly nasty."

As soon as Shane Holloway spoke, Professor Victoria Lowell  signaled to the other students. "What are you all standing around for? Greet Professor Eleanor Watson."

Ashley Lowell pursed her lips and stayed silent.

Famous, and also very arrogant.

Fiona Valentine gave a slight nod, her smile gentle and graceful. "Hello, Professor."

Amelia Roscente's eyes darted away nervously.

She had visited multiple times before, checking on his illness and bringing gifts, practically wanting to enshrine Professor Eleanor Watson.

Now she was standing on Professor Victoria Lowell 's side.

She knew exactly how she had gotten this graduate position.

Couldn't get in on merit, so she used connections.

Professor Eleanor Watson naturally knew this too.

That's why she didn't dare to look him in the eye.

Only the boy named Jude Granger rushed forward excitedly, tightly grasping Professor Eleanor Watson's hand—

"Professor Eleanor Watson, hello! My name is Jude Granger! Yun as in 'cultivation'! I've read your papers, watched your lecture videos. I never thought I'd get to meet you in person today. I... I'm so excited..."

He was breathing rapidly, his whole body trembling, his eyes unusually bright.

Professor Eleanor Watson was a bit stunned. After a moment, he gently returned the handshake. "Hello, student Jude Granger."

The boy's dark face quickly flushed red. He scratched his head, revealing a set of white teeth.

He was very tall, probably 185 cm, wearing a simple, old T-shirt and shorts, with leather sandals on his feet.

His smile was strong and simple-minded.

Shane Holloway pulled him back. "Get to the side, you country bumpkin! Embarrassing!"

Jude Granger didn't seem to care at all, still immersed in the excitement of Professor Eleanor Watson saying his name.

Professor Victoria Lowell 's expression darkened.

Her own student wagging its tail at her rival was no different from publicly undermining her.

But she quickly adjusted her emotions, raising a smile again. "Professor Eleanor Watson, aren't you going to introduce your students?"

Professor Eleanor Watson didn't want to deal with her at all.

Shane Holloway's eyes shifted. "Yes, Professor Eleanor Watson. It's your turn."

Professor Eleanor Watson's face was cold. "We're not in the same research group. There's no need for introductions."

Without waiting for Professor Victoria Lowell  to speak, Shane Holloway took the initiative to provoke. "Is there no need, or do you just have nothing worth showing off?"

"You—" Hannah Morse  was so angry she glared. "A dog's mouth can't produce ivory!"

Shane Holloway: "A dog is still better than this fat pig."

Hannah Morse  was stunned.

Although it was true she was overweight, this was the first time someone had called her a "fat pig" to her face!

Clara's expression instantly darkened. "It seems Professor Xu's students aren't much. Vulgar insults, personal attacks. Their quality is concerning. As the saying goes, birds of a feather flock together. It seems the upper beam is not straight, and the lower ones are crooked!"

This remark not only insulted Shane Holloway but also implicated Professor Victoria Lowell  and the others.

"You're that mature-age graduate student, right?" Professor Victoria Lowell  finally looked directly at Clara, a scornful smile appearing. "Quick with the tongue. I just wonder if your ability is directly proportional."

Shane Holloway: "Exactly! What normal student is almost thirty before getting into grad school? Either there's something wrong with their brain, or they lack talent. Is the bar for academia this low now?"

Clara's expression was calm. "Whether there's something wrong with my brain is none of your business. But you—you are truly sick."

Marcus Lawrence suddenly chimed in. "Rabies, to be precise. Biting anyone it sees."

Then, he looked at Professor Victoria Lowell . "If I were the owner, I'd put down a disobedient dog like this early, lest it bites me someday."

Professor Victoria Lowell  felt a chill down her spine.

Shane Holloway yelled on the spot—

"Who are you calling a dog?! You're the dogs! You're all sick!"

Clara: "Whoever is barking. Professor, let's go. No need to bother with these roadblockers blocking the path."

Professor Eleanor Watson, who had been so angry he was panting, suddenly wasn't angry anymore.

"Okay."

The group of four prepared to leave.

Professor Victoria Lowell  suddenly spoke. "The department's research funding has been approved. You haven't published a decent paper in years. If I were you, I'd be self-aware and step aside, making room for those who are truly capable."

Professor Eleanor Watson's back stiffened abruptly.

Professor Victoria Lowell : "Resources should be directed towards those who truly need them, not wasted by those who rest on their laurels and idle away. Don't you agree, Professor Eleanor Watson?"

Clara turned her head, saying coldly, "Whether it's a waste or not isn't for you to decide. Academic results will prove who deserves the resources."

"Well said!" Professor Victoria Lowell  clapped. "Then I'll wait and see what academic results you can produce."

Clara's group left.

Shane Holloway sneered. "With Senior Brother Caleb Watson around, you're nothing!"

...

The opening ceremony was the next day.

Seating was organized by school.

Clara, Hannah Morse , and Marcus Lawrence sat together.

As per tradition, school leadership spoke, department leadership spoke, the student representative spoke...

The three of them were practically falling asleep.

Suddenly, there was a commotion at the back of their school's section, accompanied by whispers—

"Was that really Senior Brother Caleb Watson who just passed by?"

"Absolutely no mistake!"

"But shouldn't he be incredibly busy? Why would he come to the opening ceremony?"

"Who knows? Maybe to see the spectacle?"

"See the spectacle... Do you think someone known as 'SCI on legs' has that much free time?"

"What's 'SCI on legs'?"

"You actually don't know?!"

"Uh... know what?"

"Senior Brother Caleb Watson, Professor Professor Victoria Lowell 's prized disciple. Top science student who got into MIT. Started publishing papers as an undergrad. In his senior year, he published three SCI papers in one go, got direct admission to grad school, and has had impressive academic成果 every year since."

"It's no exaggeration to say he single-handedly supports half of the School of Life Sciences' academic output. Professor Xu values him highly. Even the department leadership has to be polite and smile when they see him."

This was the second time in just two days that Clara had heard the name "Caleb Watson."
###Chapter 198

The opening ceremony ended.

Sophia Sullivan's graduate studies had officially begun.

Her class schedule was packed.

It ran from nine in the morning until noon, with barely any breaks.

Hannah Morse nearly overslept on her first day.

She rushed into the classroom wearing shorts and flip-flops.

Sophia glanced at her. "Hannah, you didn't change your shoes?"

Hannah looked down at her Crocs. "I did change. These are new."

"You're wearing flip-flops to class?"

"Yeah, is that a problem? Everyone wears them in summer back home."

Marcus Lawrence shot a look. "You call this formal?"

Hannah glared back. "Why isn't it formal?"

Marcus was silent for a moment. "Whatever makes you happy."

Hannah sniffed. "You just don't get it."

He really didn't.

The bell rang, signaling the end of class.

The three of them planned to have lunch together.

During their chat, Sophia learned neither of them lived on campus.

Marcus lived at home.

Hannah rented an apartment near the university.

Coincidentally, Hannah lived very close to Sophia.

Hannah liked Sophia a lot.

She was often mocked for her weight, and few girls wanted to be friends with her.

Sophia was different.

She was beautiful but not arrogant, sincere and without prejudice.

"Sophia, there's this super popular little restaurant near campus. Even influencers go there. It's cheap too. Let's try it…"

Before she could finish, a bouquet of yellow roses was suddenly presented to Sophia.

Ethan Roscente stood there in a suit, his collar slightly open.

His cropped trousers made his legs look long and straight.

He walked up to Sophia, holding the yellow roses.

"Mimi, long time no see."

Hannah blinked and tactfully pulled Marcus away.

"What are you doing?" Marcus frowned.

"Can't you see someone is giving her flowers?"

"So?"

"You want to be a third wheel?"

Marcus fell silent.

Sophia looked at Ethan, her brow slightly furrowed. "What are you doing here?"

"Your favorite yellow roses. Happy start of the semester."

He offered her the bouquet.

Sophia took half a step back. "I don't want them."

He gave a bitter smile. "Can't I even say congratulations?"

"You can say it. But I won't accept the flowers."

Sophia wasn't falling for it.

Ethan asked, "Do we have to be like this?"

Sophia replied, "Haven't we been like this for a while now?"

He was left speechless.

"Wow! Someone's getting flowers!"

"That guy is so handsome!"

"Who's the girl? I haven't seen her before."

"Is she a new student?"

People came and went at the university gate. Ethan's flashy gesture drew many eyes.

Though most didn't know Sophia, some did.

"Hey, isn't that the mature-age graduate student?"

Ashley Lowell stopped walking.

Fiona Valentine beside her also stopped, following her gaze.

The next second, she froze.

A tall, handsome man was holding yellow roses, standing before Sophia, who looked cold and indifferent.

Ashley scoffed lightly. "It's good to be pretty. Getting chased after just days into the semester."

"Fiona, you're not bad either. How come no one sends you flowers?"

Fiona smiled. "What's there to compare?"

"Stop pretending to be above it all. I don't believe you're not jealous!"

Fiona's smile remained unchanged.

Ashley snorted. "Too much pretense is just hypocrisy." She turned and walked away.

Fiona stood still, her smile gradually fading.

Two boys stood not far away.

Caleb Watson was speaking. "...Did you remember everything I said?"

Jude Granger scratched his head, then suddenly looked ahead. "Whoa!"

Caleb followed his gaze and saw the flower-giving scene. He frowned. "If you want academic success, don't get distracted by irrelevant things. Like dating."

"...Got it, senior!" Jude nodded emphatically.

But...

"That girl seems to be Professor Watson's student," he added. "She's really impressive."

She left Shane Holloway speechless and even dared to mock Professor Lowell publicly.

So cool!

Caleb wasn't interested. He glanced over and then looked away.

"Let's go. I'll take you to the supermarket to get some daily necessities."

Jude quickly waved his hands. "No, no need. I brought everything."

Caleb's mouth twitched. "You mean the toothbrush with flying bristles, or the towel full of holes?"

Jude's dark face flushed with embarrassment. "I... I think they can still be used..."

New things cost money.

Caleb sighed softly, as if seeing his past self.

He and Jude were from the same village, but Caleb had gotten into MIT for his undergraduate studies earlier.

Jude only went to a regular 211 university for his undergrad and took two tries to get into MIT for grad school.

Being from the same hometown, Caleb naturally wanted to look out for him.

For rural kids like them, warmth was a rare luxury in this unfamiliar city.

Having been through the rain, he wanted to hold an umbrella for someone else.

"I'll buy them for you."

"No, really," Jude said hurriedly, waving his hands. "My folks gave me some money."

In his panic, his accent slipped out.

Caleb didn't say more, just led him towards the supermarket.

Some confession, some man, some girl—it had nothing to do with him.

They hesitated over buying a new toothbrush, while others spent hundreds on a bouquet of flowers.

The world was never fair.

Sophia avoided the yellow roses again. "I have things to do. I'm leaving."

She walked straight over to Hannah and Marcus.

Ethan stood there holding the flowers, a bitter smile on his lips.

After who knows how long, Sophia left, and the onlookers dispersed.

He walked to a trash can and let go.

The bright yellow roses fell into the filth.

He turned and left.

Fiona was still there.

She watched Ethan's retreating figure thoughtfully for a long time before finally leaving with her books.

Sophia met up with the two others and they walked together to the trendy restaurant.

A modest line had formed outside the restaurant by noon.

They waited for two parties to be seated before a table was ready.
###Chapter 199

Hannah had been holding back the entire walk. She finally found a chance to speak. "Sophia, did you know that handsome guy who gave you the flowers? Those yellow roses were gorgeous."

Sophia nodded faintly. "An ex-boyfriend."

Hannah was immediately stunned. She didn't dare ask anything more.

Marcus glanced at Sophia but said nothing.

After the meal, the three of them went to Professor Watson's office.

There were no afternoon classes. Professor Watson planned to take them into the lab.

Hannah's eyes widened in surprise. "We're going into the lab already?"

She thought it would take at least a year before they could touch any experimental projects.

Though Marcus appeared calm, a flicker of surprise also passed through his eyes.

Only Sophia understood. Their professor's research had been delayed for too long. She desperately needed a breakthrough now.

They stayed in the lab until it was dark outside.

It was already nine p.m. when Sophia got home. She hadn't eaten dinner yet.

Exhausted, she collapsed directly onto the sofa. Her eyelids felt so heavy she could barely keep them open.

Suddenly, a knock sounded at the door.

Sophia forced herself up to answer it. "Professor?"

"I heard Professor Watson took you to the lab today?"

"Yes."

"Just got back?"

"Yes."

"Haven't had dinner yet?"

Alexander chuckled softly. "Wait a moment."

He turned and went back to his own apartment. He soon returned holding a food container.

"It's still warm. It'll have to do."

Sophia blinked. "This is..."

"From my family."

"I really shouldn't..."

"I've already eaten. This is extra."

Sophia was genuinely hungry. She took the container. "Thank you, Professor. I'll wash it and return it after I eat."

"Alright."

Sophia opened the container. A wave of warm steam hit her face.

The first layer held fragrant white rice.

The second layer was filled with meat dishes. Braised pork ribs with an enticing color, and tomato stewed beef brisket that smelled amazing.

The third layer had separate compartments for stir-fried seasonal vegetables and a warm, comforting soup.

...

The Laurent family estate was brightly lit.

Sylvia was restless, pacing back and forth in the living room.

Frederick was getting a headache from her movement. "What are you doing pacing around so late instead of sleeping?"

"It's your son!"

"Which son?"

"Alexander!"

Frederick raised an eyebrow. "What about him?"

"He actually asked for two portions of food today!"

"What's so strange about that?"

"I suspect he has a girlfriend!"

Frederick was dismissive. "Maybe he brought it for a friend. You're overthinking it."

"He's always buried in the lab. When would he have time to make friends?"

"It's normal for a man his age to date. Haven't you been nagging him about it?"

Sylvia sighed. "I'm going to bed."

"Done pacing?"

"I need to get up early tomorrow."

She had to go check out her son's place and see what was really going on.

...

Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains into the room.

Sophia was woken by the light. She got up and washed up.

Breakfast was pre-set congee, sweet and soft.

After tidying the kitchen, she left on time.

As she passed the fourth floor, she suddenly heard an exclamation from downstairs.

Looking through the railing, she saw a woman in a long dress and high heels who had tripped over garbage left in the hallway.

The third-floor residents always piled their trash in the corridor. It was dirty and messy.

This woman was clearly unfamiliar with the environment. Combined with her high heels, she had accidentally fallen.

"Are you alright?" Sophia stepped forward to help her up.

"Thank you—" Sylvia looked up and froze the moment she saw Sophia's face.

This face was very familiar to her.

The tea master at the tasting soirée who had bluntly said her tea skills were lacking.

Sylvia still remembered the other society ladies snickering at the time.

She couldn't quite explain why, but she just didn't like this girl.

Perhaps it was how dazzling she looked wearing a cheongsam.

Perhaps it was how close she was to Isabella.

Anyway, she just found her disagreeable.

Sophia also recognized the other woman. She responded coolly, "You're welcome."

She let go and took a step back.

Sylvia frowned slightly at her distant manner.

She originally didn't want to engage, but couldn't help asking, "What are you doing here?"

Sophia answered calmly, "I live here."
###Chapter 200

Sylvia Laurent frowned deeply.

The hallway was cluttered with miscellaneous items.

The walls were stained with grime.

The iron railing was coated in a thick layer of dust.

She couldn't help but complain. "What kind of dump is this? Trash everywhere, it stinks. Doesn't the property management do anything?"

Sophia Sullivan glanced at her watch.

She would be late if she didn't leave now.

She ignored Sylvia's grumbling and turned to leave.

Sylvia stood frozen in place.

That feeling of being ignored washed over her again.

She looked up the staircase.

A full seven flights remained.

Sylvia took a deep breath.

Her high heels made sharp clicking sounds on the steps.

She muttered to herself as she climbed. "A perfectly good mansion sits empty, but she has to rent this old place... She's insane..."

She finally reached the seventh floor.

Sylvia took out her key and opened the door.

The apartment was empty.

Alexander Laurent was indeed not home.

He was surely at the lab at this hour.

She inspected the living room carefully.

Everything was neatly arranged.

The toiletries were all for a single person.

The floor was so clean not a single long hair could be found.

Sylvia felt a twinge of doubt.

Had she been overthinking it?

She walked into the kitchen to retrieve the lunch container.

Her movements suddenly halted.

Only one set of containers remained on the countertop.

The other set was gone.

He had given it to someone.

There was definitely something going on!

Sylvia immediately returned to the main house.

"I told you there was a problem!"

Frederick Laurent raised an eyebrow. "Did you find evidence?"

"Ugh! What do you mean 'evidence'? He hasn't committed a crime!"

"If it's not a crime, why are you so worked up?"

Sylvia was lost in her own deduction. "You know Alexander's personality. He usually doesn't even glance at girls. Now he's giving someone his lunch? He's a loner. It definitely wasn't for a buddy. He absolutely has a girlfriend!"

She grew more certain as she spoke.

Frederick shook his head, holding his teacup. "You went to check on him just for that? Don't you have anything better to do? How about worrying about Xunzhi and Yanzhi's marriage plans instead of constantly watching our youngest son?"

Sylvia was indignant. "Xunzhi has his own mind. He won't listen to me anyway. Yanzhi is even less of a concern; his scandals never stop. It's only Alexander, holed up in his lab all day. As his mother, how can I not worry?"

"My son is so outstanding. Any partner he finds should at least be someone we know well, right?"

Frederick massaged his temples helplessly. "Does Alexander lack judgment? If he's really dating someone, you can't control it. Better to let things take their natural course."

Sylvia rolled her eyes. "You don't understand."

He didn't understand a mother's feelings, let her concerns about a future daughter-in-law...

Sophia Sullivan finished her classes for the day.

She had dinner at the cafeteria, then studied in the library for two more hours.

It was already dark when she left the library.

Streetlights illuminated her way home.

She reached the stairwell entrance just as Alexander Laurent returned from his evening run.

The man wore black athletic wear.

Sweat beaded on his forehead, but his breathing remained steady.

"Good evening, Professor Laurent."

"Why are you back so late?"

Sophia replied, "I was reading in the library."

They walked side by side up to the seventh floor.

"I've washed the containers. Just a moment..."

Sophia opened her door, retrieved the containers, and handed them to him.

Alexander reached out and took them.

He suddenly asked, "Is Professor Watson currently guiding you on a research project?"

"Yes. But progress hasn't been smooth..."

"I discussed it with her before. There's an issue with the research direction. But you know her temperament. She won't turn back until she hits a dead end."

Sophia felt the same.

She had suggested changes to Professor Eleanor Watson, but the professor felt it lacked data support and was unwilling to abandon two years of work.

"Are you free this Saturday? We could have dinner and discuss how to persuade her."

"Saturday..." Sophia pressed her lips together. "Sorry, I already have plans."

Alexander paused. "It's fine. We can talk another time."

"Okay."

…

Saturday morning.

Sophia and Hannah Morse met up downstairs at Marcus Lawrence's apartment building.

[I've already notified the front desk. Just give them the apartment number.]

A message came from Marcus.

Sophia looked up at the upscale apartment building.

Hannah whistled softly. "Our classmate Marcus is seriously rich."

The property deed was under Marcus's name.

They had seen it during registration.

"Come in. There are slippers."

Marcus lived on the twelfth floor.

The sensor door opened automatically.

He stood casually at the entrance.

"What would you like to drink?"

Hannah's eyes lit up. "Do you have Coke?"

"Yes. Regular or diet?"

"Regular, of course! Diet Coke has no soul!"

Marcus didn't comment and turned to Sophia. "And you?"

"Just water, please."

She wasn't particular about drinks.

After changing into slippers, Sophia looked around the apartment.

The decor, like Marcus himself, was dominated by black, white, and grey. Simple and sharp.

Hannah curiously circled the room.

She finally stopped in front of a wall cabinet, pointing at a shelf that looked like it held specimens.

"What kind of bone is this?"

Marcus replied, "A decoration."

"It's so unique. Where did you buy it? Can you share the link?"

Marcus said, "You can't buy it."

"Why not?"

"It's human bone."

"!"

What kind of person uses real human bones as decoration?!

Hannah instantly leaped three meters away.

The corner of Marcus's mouth lifted slightly. "Just kidding. I'll send you the link later."

Hannah: "..."

He was definitely sick! Seriously disturbed!

Sophia had already opened her laptop. "We have a lot of data across three groups. Let's start early."

"Okay." The two immediately got to work.

They were busy all morning.

Efficiency was much higher than expected.

Marcus's professional competence was unquestionable.

What truly surprised Sophia was Hannah.

Though her foundation wasn't as solid as Marcus's, her memory was phenomenal. She excelled at drawing inferences.

Her mental agility far surpassed ordinary people.

Hannah: "..."

Was that a compliment or an insult?
###Chapter 201

Hannah Morse snapped her laptop shut.

She stretched her arms.

Empty soda cans littered the desk.

Marcus Lawrence stood up. "My treat."

Sophia Sullivan and Hannah nodded simultaneously.

The three exchanged a look of understanding.

They anticipated many future collaborations.

The upscale restaurant glowed with soft lighting.

A piano melody drifted through the air.

A server approached with a smile. "Do you have a reservation?"

Marcus showed his phone with the booking confirmation.

The server guided them to their table.

Sophia glanced around.

This place had an excellent reputation.

It was also the most expensive.

Hannah looked around curiously.

She pulled out her phone to take pictures.

Her lens focused on a crystal chandelier.

Marcus and Sophia watched her.

Hannah smiled sheepishly. "Just sending some pics to my dad."

She lowered her head and continued photographing.

Marcus's expression shifted slightly.

He asked softly, "What does your father do?"

Hannah paused.

Her reaction made the other two misunderstand.

Marcus was about to speak.

Hannah said, "My mom is a homemaker."

"My dad is a security guard in our village."

"He sometimes goes out to sea to fish."

Her eyes lit up. "Next time, I'll treat you to freshly caught seafood!"

Sophia and Marcus exchanged a glance.

The same image formed in both their minds.

A rural family.

Hardworking parents.

Who raised such a cheerful daughter.

Sophia nodded. "We'll definitely go."

Hannah happily shook her head.

Marcus handed her the menu. "Order anything."

Hannah's eyes sparkled. "Really?"

Marcus said, "Mm-hmm."

Hannah waved to the server. "Three steaks to start!"

She emphasized the word "start."

Marcus raised an eyebrow.

Appetizers arrived quickly.

Main courses followed soon after.

Hannah finished all the desserts herself.

Sophia and Marcus hadn't touched theirs.

Hannah's cheeks were stuffed. "Aren't you guys eating?"

Sophia said, "You have them."

Marcus added, "Order more if you want."

Hannah swallowed her cake. "What do your parents do?"

Sophia said, "My dad is a teacher. My mom is a writer."

Hannah exclaimed, "That's amazing!"

She turned to Marcus.

Marcus said, "Civil servants."

Hannah praised them repeatedly.

Marcus stood to pay the bill.

The three were about to leave.

They ran into Shane Holloway's group.

Ashley Lowell and Fiona Valentine were there.

Jude Granger trailed behind them.

Shane grinned. "Professor Watson's precious students?"

The three ignored him.

Shane's smile stiffened. "Didn't Professor Watson treat you to a meal?"

"Our funding is very generous."

He deliberately raised his voice.

Jude tugged his sleeve.

Shane shook him off. "Don't touch me, you country bumpkin!"

Jude lowered his head.

Ashley spoke calmly. "That's enough."

Fiona echoed, "Caleb said we should maintain harmony."

Shane snorted.

He turned to Sophia. "Want to join our team?"

Sophia smirked. "Not worthy."

Shane raised an eyebrow smugly.

Sophia said, "Your team isn't worthy."

Shane's face darkened.

Sophia added, "What future does a team that spends its funding on food and drinks have?"

Marcus chimed in, "Isn't that against regulations?"

Hannah raised her phone. "Say that again about who's reimbursing this?"
###Chapter 202

Shane Holloway's face darkened instantly.
"What are you photographing?! That's a violation of portrait rights!"

Hannah Morse raised her phone.
"Legal evidence gathering in a public space. I'm a concerned citizen. Feel free to sue."

"You—"

Shane was livid, his face turning a shade of green.

Ashley Lowell frowned.
"Shane, stop talking nonsense."

Shane froze.

"This meal is Dutch treat. Who asked you to reimburse anything? Finish up and let's get back to campus!"

Shane shot a resentful glare at Sophia Sullivan but was pulled away by Ashley.

Jude Granger stood frozen in place.
The words "Dutch treat" made his expression shift.

"I just remembered something! I have to go!"

He turned and practically ran.

Shane sneered.
"Cheapskate! Probably scared of having to pay!"

Ashley replied, "Forget about him."

Sophia and her two friends exited the restaurant.
Their ride-share pulled up just then.

Hannah and Marcus Lawrence got in first.

As Sophia moved to open the front passenger door, a figure in the corner caught her eye.

She paused and walked toward the shadows.
"Jude?"

A tall figure emerged awkwardly from the darkness, scratching his head.
"That's me."

"We're heading back to campus. We can give you a lift."

"Really?" Jude's eyes lit up, though he still seemed hesitant.

It was a long way back to campus.
A taxi would cost over twenty dollars.

He had planned to take the bus, but service had stopped for the night.

He'd placed a ride-share pool order for just five dollars, but no one had accepted it.

Just as he was weighing his options, Sophia appeared.

"It's on our way."

"Thank you!"

Jude was too tall, so Sophia had him take the front seat.

The back was already crowded with Hannah, and adding him would have been too tight.

The driver chuckled.
"Son, you're a big one. My car feels smaller with you in it."

Jude smiled sheepishly, revealing a set of very white teeth.

Fifteen minutes later, the car stopped at the university gates.

Jude got out.
Seeing the three still inside, he looked puzzled.
"We're here. Aren't you getting out?"

Sophia replied, "We don't live on campus."

"Oh..." He scratched his head again.
"Thank you for today."

He suddenly shoved something through the window at Sophia, then turned and sprinted away.

Sophia looked down.

It was a twenty-dollar bill.

Mobile payments were ubiquitous now.
Few people used cash.

Marcus glanced over.
"Incredibly earnest."

The total fare was twenty-five dollars.
Split four ways, it was just over six dollars each.

Just because they weren't going to the dorms, Jude had insisted on paying twenty.

Hannah sighed softly.
"Such a shame he's with the wrong advisor. Why did he choose Victoria Lowell?"

Marcus said, "He's from the same hometown as Caleb Watson. Naturally, he'd choose her."

"How do you know that?"

"Caleb was looking for him on orientation day."

"I see."

These days, many people pretended to be simple.
Genuinely kind and honest ones were rare.

...

The car stopped at the mouth of the alley.
Sophia got out.

Marcus and Hannah had already left.

Sophia walked toward her apartment building.

Moonlight streamed down like water.
The stars were sparse.

The summer wind was hot and stifling, offering no relief.

Her steps suddenly halted.

Leaning against a tree by the building's entrance was a man, hands in his pockets.

Seeing her, he immediately straightened up.

A smile touched his lips.

"Surprised?"

Sebastian Evans walked up to her.

Sophia was slightly taken aback.
"A little."

"How's the start of the semester treating you?"

"Fine."

"Lots of classes?"

The question hit a nerve.
Not just lots—it was an explosion!

Sebastian chuckled softly.
"Your expression tells me everything."

"...Is it that obvious?" She touched her face.

"No."

"Then how could you tell?"

Sebastian said, "I have a sharp eye."

Sophia's lip twitched.

"It's too hot out here. I know you won't invite me up, so how about we find someplace cool to sit?"

He certainly knew his place.

"I bet you're thinking, 'This guy is pretty perceptive.'"

Sophia: "!"

"Seems I guessed right again."

"..."

They went to their usual bubble tea shop.

It was just across the street, and the air conditioning was strong.

Sebastian was in a business suit, looking completely out of place in the bubble tea shop.

It drew quite a few glances.

Sophia asked, "What would you like? My treat."

"Oreo Milk Tea. No ice. Full sugar."

"?"

"Why that look?" Sebastian raised an eyebrow.

Sophia was silent for a moment before walking to the counter.
"Two Oreo Milk Teas. No ice. Full sugar."

The man laughed softly.
"So you like it too? Great minds think alike?"

Sophia: "Just a coincidence."

Sebastian's lips curved.

How many coincidences could there possibly be in this world?

What she liked, what she disliked—he had figured it all out over the years.

He knew her better than Ethan Roscente ever did.

The drinks were ready quickly.

They sat opposite each other.

Sophia asked, "What did you need to see me about?"

"Can't I just want to see you?" He arched a brow.

Sophia was silent for two seconds.
"I don't think you would."

If it were just small talk, Sebastian wouldn't have found a specific place.

He certainly wouldn't have shown up outside her building late at night.

Even if he truly wanted to see her, he would have found a proper reason, not come so abruptly.

"So who showed up abruptly to see you?" Sebastian's gaze turned sharp.

Sophia: "..." Was that the point?

"...Has Ethan been to see you recently?"

She didn't want to answer.

Sebastian wouldn't let it go, smiling faintly.
"Let me guess. He definitely came, and it wasn't at night."

"..."

"And he brought flowers."

"..."

Sebastian: "You're at school during the day, so he went to find you there?"

He got every single detail right.

Sophia gave a light laugh.
"With guessing skills like that, why not set up a fortune-telling booth?"

"I'm only interested in one person's fate."

She asked without thinking, "Whose fate?"
###Chapter 203

The words left Sophia's mouth, and she immediately regretted them.

But spoken words are like spilled water; impossible to take back.

Sebastian chuckled softly. "You."

His gaze was intense. "I'm interested in you."

Sophia immediately looked up at the sky.

The man raised an eyebrow. "Stop pretending. I know you understood."

"I can't hear you," she said, clearing her throat lightly. "Don't say things like that in the future."

Seeing her play dumb, Sebastian couldn't help but laugh. "Hide all you want. You can avoid today, but not forever."

"Ah," Sophia interrupted him. "I forgot to bring tissues. Do you have any?"

"I do."

"Lend me one, thanks."

Sebastian smiled knowingly. "Can you hear me now?"

Sophia fell silent.

She had guessed correctly. Sebastian did have something to find her about.

He waited until her milk tea was almost finished before getting to the point.

"Professor Murphy is stuck on a research subject. There's been no progress for two months. He wanted to hear your thoughts. Here are all the materials."

He handed her a USB drive.

Sophia reached for it, but Sebastian didn't let go immediately.

Their fingertips touched.

His body temperature was noticeably higher than hers. The sensation was distinctly clear.

Sophia took the drive and quickly withdrew her hand.

Sebastian's smile deepened, tinged with amusement.

On purpose!

He absolutely did that on purpose!

Sophia glared at him, but he proactively offered her a tissue.

"Wipe it. Stop complaining about it."

Sophia fell silent again. Anger was one thing, but it faded in an instant.

When someone says that, holding a grudge just seems petty.

Bumping into people accidentally on the street is common. Why was she so hung up on it happening with Sebastian?

Didn't that prove, subconsciously, she didn't see him as just an ordinary person?

It was a trap no matter which way she looked at it!

After leaving the milk tea shop, Sebastian walked her to her building.

As they parted, Sophia suddenly spoke. "You're too calculating. It's better if we have less contact in the future!"

Hearing this, he wasn't angry but laughed instead. "You're scared."

"Scared of what?" Sophia frowned.

"Scared of being moved by me. Scared of losing your heart without even realizing it." The current Sebastian was confident and bold.

Pfft—

Sophia nearly choked. "I'm scared of being led around by you and falling into a trap!"

"Well, the meaning is similar."

Sophia: "?"

How was it similar? It was completely different!

"Whatever. I won't argue with you. I can never win against you anyway."

With that, she turned and went upstairs.

Sebastian stood where he was, watching her leave.

He didn't look away until the girl's figure disappeared around the stairwell.

He waited until the light in her window turned on before finally leaving.

After finishing her washing, Sophia took out the USB drive and plugged it into her computer.

While waiting for it to load, she suddenly realized—

Professor Murphy had classes every day. Wouldn't it have been more convenient to just give it to her at school?

Why would he have Sebastian specially deliver it late at night?

She'd been tricked again!

Meanwhile, Sebastian was driving home when he received a call from Professor Benjamin Murphy.

"Professor, what is it?"

"My USB drive? Did you see it when you came over today? I remember putting it in the drawer…"

"Oh, I took it."

"Huh? Why did you take it? It's full of research materials! I was planning to give it to Sophia tomorrow. You—"

"I already delivered it to her."

"…What?" Professor Murphy was stunned.

"Who delivered it? When? Why didn't you tell me?"

"I happened to be at school today. I heard you mention this afternoon you wanted to give it to Sophia, so I brought it to her on my way."

"Is that so… You should have told me. I've been looking for it everywhere…"

Sebastian thought to himself that explaining beforehand would have been troublesome. It was better to ask for forgiveness than permission.

Out loud, he said, "It was a last-minute decision. I forgot to tell you."

"Alright. As long as she has it."

"Mm."

Ending the call, the man rested his hands on the steering wheel and whistled cheerfully.

…

In the study, Alexander Laurent was compiling experimental data.

But he couldn't concentrate.

His mind kept replaying the scene he'd witnessed two hours ago from his balcony—

Sebastian and her walking side by side from the alley entrance.

The man was saying something, his head lowered. Sophia listened, frowned first, then rolled her eyes in exasperation before finally running off.

Sebastian stood there watching her, like one would watch a mischievous child, with a mix of helplessness and indulgence.

Under the streetlights, their shadows stretched long.

Parts of them overlapped, like a couple in intimacy.

So… the person she had plans with was Sebastian?

Alexander snapped back to attention, looking at the computer screen. It was a mess again…

Which column did he start from?

Which row was he on?

In the end, he had to start over from scratch.

At 3 a.m., the light in the study was still on.

Alexander closed his laptop. He still hadn't managed to sort it out.

Forget it. He would deal with it tomorrow.

He washed his face briefly and lay down, but tossed and turned, unable to sleep.

When he finally did fall asleep, it wasn't peaceful—

His dreams were chaotic and absurd.

The specific scenes were unclear, everything hazy before his eyes, as if veiled by a thin gauze.

A slender figure drew closer and closer to him.

He felt feverish, loosening his tie, unbuttoning his shirt collar, his throat moving slightly.

But it wasn't nearly enough. His body felt scorched by flames, a thirst burning from the inside out.

Uncomfortable, agonized, and an indescribable… yearning.

As if bewitched, he moved closer to that figure, took the woman's soft hand, let his touch wander to her arm, then caressed her slender neck.

The woman's jade-like skin was like a spring quenching thirst, making him want to draw more from it.

With a cautious yearning, he finally pressed against those red lips. The woman let out a soft moan.

The sound seemed magical, easily pulling out the desires hidden in his heart, making the fire within him burn fiercer and fiercer…

The woman turned her head. He finally saw her face clearly.

Sophia…

The next morning, Alexander looked at his damp sleep pants. Shame and frustration nearly overwhelmed him.

Recalling those chaotic and suggestive scenes from his dream, he felt utterly mortified.

How could he have such a dream?

How could he have such a dream?

Alexander Laurent, what on earth were you thinking?!

…

Sophia was blissfully unaware of someone's anguish.

She had slept soundly and woke up refreshed, heading to school with plenty of energy.

Her morning was packed with classes.

After lunch, she, Marcus Lawrence, and Hannah Morse went to the laboratory.

Professor Eleanor Watson happened to be there too.

Sophia walked over to her. "Professor, can I talk to you for a moment?"

Professor Watson was taken aback.

"Okay."
###Chapter 204

They entered the operations room.

Sophia Sullivan didn't beat around the bush.

She spoke directly. "Professor, your research direction is flawed."

Professor Eleanor Watson was about to speak.

Sophia handed her a file.

"We spent the weekend reviewing the project's progress."

"We re-examined the research background, experimental methods, specific data, and the conclusions from the first two phases."

She looked up, meeting Eleanor's gaze directly.

"The lack of progress in the third phase isn't the issue itself."

"The entire project has been off-track from the very beginning."

The three of them discovered the problem together.

Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence were hesitant to speak.

Sophia took on the role of the bad cop.

Eleanor fell silent.

Sophia continued.

"I understand your personality."

"If you don't do something, you don't do it at all. If you do it, you see it through to the end."

"Even if it proves to be wrong, you demand data to support that conclusion."

"There's nothing wrong with a scholar's pursuit of perfection."

"But life is finite. Energy is limited."

"You could have corrected this early, but instead, you spent time proving the error."

"Is there any meaning in that?"

It was like seeing a car crash about to happen.

Why actually crash when you could just hit the brakes?

Eleanor let out a long sigh.

"I had wondered how long it would take you to discover the problem."

"One semester? A year? Two years?"

"I didn't expect it to be this fast."

Her eyes held emotion, surprise.

But mostly, pride.

Not only did they discover it, but they also compiled the evidence.

She patted the file without opening it.

She knew it was filled with facts.

There was no refuting it.

Sophia was stunned. "Professor, you—"

"You thought I didn't know it was off-track?"

At first, she might have truly been unaware.

As the research deepened, the problems emerged.

With Eleanor's ability, how could she not have noticed?

"Then why did you…"

"You want to ask why I didn't terminate it?"

Sophia nodded.

Eleanor's gaze dimmed.

"I'm not a good advisor…"

The project was planned four years ago.

Her health was already very poor at that time.

Coupled with Sophia giving up the combined Master's and Ph.D. program.

Eleanor fell seriously ill.

It took eight months of recuperation for her to improve.

She still couldn't devote herself fully to academia.

But the project couldn't be shelved.

"…It concerned whether the students could graduate on time."

Graduate students are supposed to conduct "research" with a "research" mindset.

How is that measured?

Paper output is the most important.

Next is the quantity and quality of projects done with their advisor.

This is also directly linked to their papers.

Eleanor fell ill, but the project couldn't stop.

The initial stages were left to the graduate students at the time to explore on their own.

By the time she recovered and returned to the lab.

The first two phases of the project were already completed.

These two phases saw two cohorts of students graduate.

If things went smoothly, the third phase would see this year's graduates through.

Eleanor: "…You think I didn't want to change course? It was too late. Too much had been invested. Even knowing it was a sunk cost, I could only double down."

The situation was beyond remedy.

"Fortunately, someone discovered the problem."

Did others really not sense it?

Sophia didn't believe that.

But once on the boat, they couldn't turn back.

They could only continue the mistake to the end.

For most graduate students, their ambition isn't in research.

A Master's degree is just to gain a slight advantage in the job market.

A thesis isn't an academic achievement; it's a graduation requirement.

If Eleanor suddenly overturned the project.

The previously graduated students wouldn't care.

But what about the graduate students about to graduate?

They had based their graduation theses on this project, preparing them long ago.

It wasn't that Eleanor didn't want to change course.

She couldn't!

"Blame my failing health, lying in the hospital for too long."

"When I discovered the problem, for the sake of the graduates, I didn't mention it."

"Later, I never brought it up."

Now, wanting to correct the deviation was impossible.

The circumstances were forcing her hand.

"But I am comforted that you discovered the problem so quickly and found the key."

Sophia was silent.

Eleanor suddenly asked. "What do you think of Hannah and Marcus?"

"…In what aspect?"

"Academic thinking, research talent, character, and attitude."

Sophia pondered for a moment.

"…Their overall conditions are good."

Both could think independently; otherwise, they wouldn't have discovered the problem.

After discovering the problem, they verified it immediately.

In this, all three were the same.

During the verification process, both displayed their respective strengths.

Hannah's thinking was active, her memory astonishing.

Marcus was calm and composed, able to view problems from a high level.

After listening, Eleanor smiled.

"It seems I didn't choose the wrong people."

"Since you've discovered the direction is problematic, and you have ideas in mind."

"This current project is meaningless to you now."

She spoke word by word.

"Follow your train of thought. Start a new project."

"But the lab…" There was only one.

Its scale was smaller than Alexander Laurent's lab.

It couldn't support two simultaneous research projects.

Eleanor: "Apply to the department for another lab."

A new project lab just for the three of you.

…

The conversation ended.

Sophia conveyed Eleanor's intentions.

Hannah's brows furrowed.

"So we just let this current project continue wrongly? Ignore it? Does the research still have any meaning?"

Sophia: "A wrong direction doesn't mean it's meaningless. Any conclusion is worth exploring, right or wrong."

"Now we have a clear direction."

"Rather than spending time verifying a mistake, it's better to explore what's correct."

"The latter holds more value."

This doesn't mean the former is utterly meaningless.

Scientific research is vast, academia boundless.

In the rolling long river, there is both right and wrong.

They interact, corroborating each other.

Building a healthy research ecosystem.

Clear river water, silt at the bottom, schools of fish within.

If it were just water, it couldn't be called a "river."

So next…
###Chapter 205

Sophia Sullivan looked up at Marcus Lawrence.

"Let's apply for a lab ourselves."

Hannah Morse's eyes widened.

Marcus paused his movements.

Both were stunned by the suggestion.

"Professor Watson…"

"Don't worry, she won't object." Sophia's tone was calm. "She was the one who suggested it."

Marcus immediately opened the academic system to submit the application.

The page showed the application was sent.

A reply was expected within three days.

Three days later, the result came.

The application was rejected.

The reason given was no available labs.

Sophia frowned. "That lab is clearly empty."

Hannah put down her snack. "Is the administration office blocking us?"

Marcus stood up silently.

He went directly to the administration office.

"The system shows the lab is unused. Why was the application rejected?"

The staff member pulled up the system interface.

"It shows as unavailable here." The teacher scrolled the mouse. "Let me check the records."

The result came a few minutes later.

"It was just assigned to Caleb Watson three days ago. You're in the same department, you know him?"

Marcus's gaze darkened.

Caleb had his own dedicated lab.

He had no need to apply for another one.

"There are other empty labs. You can choose a different one."

Marcus shook his head.

Their experiment required the CPRT Dynamometer.

There were only two in the entire department.

One was permanently occupied by Professor Victoria Lowell's team.

The other was in this specific lab.

"So we have to use this one?" Hannah exclaimed. "And now Caleb took it?"

She threw down her sandwich in anger.

"This is deliberate! I'm going to find the professor!"

Sophia stopped her.

Marcus spoke at the same time. "The professor is at the hospital."

Hannah immediately deflated.

Eleanor Watson's health had always been poor.

They often saw her drinking herbal medicine.

The strong scent of it filled her entire office.

"What do we do now?" Hannah looked at them both.

Sophia's expression was steady. "We can't change the system's approval."

Marcus nodded. "Our only option is through Caleb."

Sophia stood up. "Let's go talk to him."

...

"Caleb, someone's here to see you."

Caleb set down his equipment and removed his gloves.

He saw the three of them outside the lab.

He was slightly taken aback.

Recognizing Professor Watson's new graduate students.

"Can I help you?" he asked.

Marcus spoke first. "Do you conduct all your experiments here, Caleb?"

"Most of them are here," Caleb replied. "Unless I need specialized equipment."

Sophia asked directly. "Did you apply for Lab C122?"

Caleb's expression faltered slightly.

Sophia continued. "Your research doesn't require the CPRT Dynamometer."

Caleb lowered his eyes, silent.

When he looked up, his expression was calm.

"I did apply for it." His tone was even. "I use it occasionally."

Sophia watched him. "But the lab has been empty."

Caleb: "The usage frequency isn't high."

Hannah couldn't help but start to speak.

Sophia stopped her with a look.

"How long do you anticipate needing it?" Sophia asked.

Caleb shook his head. "It's uncertain."

"We understand."

Sophia signaled for the other two to leave.

Caleb watched their retreating backs, his brow furrowed.

He returned to the lab to finish his work.

Then he changed clothes and went to the administration building.

The door to Victoria Lowell's office was slightly ajar.

Voices could be heard inside.

"Why can't I apply for the National Scholarship?" Ashley's voice was dissatisfied.

"The departmental scholarship application is already an exception." Victoria's tone was stern. "The national one is too competitive. It draws unwanted attention."

Ashley complained. "The amount is so much less... And why does Caleb get it?"

"He has published papers, achieved results, and has a top GPA. What do you have?" Victoria's voice turned cold.

Ashley was indignant. "I have papers too!"

Victoria snorted. "Shall I explain how you got them?"

Ashley's tone immediately softened. "Auntie, I just want to make you proud."

Victoria's attitude eased slightly. "You'll be prioritized next year."

"Thank you, Auntie!"

"Watch how you address me."

"I know, no one's around right now..."

A knock sounded on the door.

Victoria gave a look.

Ashley immediately stepped to the side.

"Come in."

Caleb pushed the door open, his expression normal.

He seemed already aware of their relationship.

Victoria smiled warmly. "Caleb, come in. Have a seat."

Ashley pursed her lips and said nothing.

Caleb politely declined the offer of tea.

Victoria asked gently. "What can I do for you?"
###Chapter 206

Caleb stood before the desk.

His gaze was fixed on Professor Victoria Lowell's face.

"You applied for the lab using my name?"

Victoria looked up.

A smile curved her lips.

"Yes, that's correct."

"Who is the lab for? I need to coordinate."

Victoria gave a light laugh.

"It's not for anyone."

"Just leaving it idle?" Caleb's fingers tightened slightly.

"Yes, empty."

He should have remained silent as he always did.

But Sophia Sullivan's accusatory eyes flashed in his mind.

Caleb spoke suddenly.

"If it's not needed, why apply?"

Victoria raised an eyebrow.

She hadn't expected her obedient dog to suddenly bare its teeth.

Her smile grew warmer.

"Not needed now doesn't mean never needed. Academic resources must be seized. You understand that."

"What special resources does that lab have?"

"The CPRT Dynamometer is there."

"Our group already has one."

"Two are better than one."

"Equipment that's redundant for us might be urgently needed by other groups…"

"Caleb." Victoria cut him off. "Are you free lately? Is your lab work all finished?"

"...No."

Victoria's expression turned cold.

"Then focus on your own duties! Don't worry about useless things! Even if you're a genius, remember who gives you your resources!"

Caleb's mouth tightened.

His jawline went rigid.

Victoria watched him coldly.

Until…

He lowered his eyes.

Returning to that obedient student.

"Sorry, Professor."

The smile returned to Victoria's face.

"Don't be nervous, I'm just strict. Focus on your academics, and there will always be rewards."

Caleb had heard this too many times.

So for three years of graduate school, he had never slacked off.

"We'll hold the lab for now, discuss it later. Anything else?"

Caleb shook his head.

"No."

"Then you may go."

"Yes, Professor."

"Wait—" Victoria stopped him.

"No matter how busy you are with the lab, don't forget Ashley's thesis. Finish it this month."

Caleb frowned.

"I gave her one half a year ago."

Ashley interjected.

"Something from half a year ago is useless now."

Victoria shot her niece a glare.

She stood and walked over to Caleb.

She patted his shoulder.

"I know you're busy, and looking after Ashley too, it must be hard… I understand."

"I spoke with your parents yesterday. I heard the storm destroyed your family's orchard. Just when it should be making money, the weather was uncooperative."

Victoria sighed.

As if genuinely distressed.

"I'm far away, can't help much, but I transferred fifty thousand to your parents. It's not much, but it can help in an emergency."

Caleb kept his eyes down.

No emotion showed.

But his fists were clenched tight under his sleeves.

After a long moment.

He unclenched his fists.

As if completely surrendering.

"Thank you, Professor. I've troubled you all these years."

"It's only right. You're my most accomplished student. Of course I favor my own, right?"

Caleb was silent.

He was always quiet.

Leaving others with only an impression of stillness.

"Go back. Arrange time for the thesis as you see fit. I believe you won't disappoint me."

Caleb turned and left.

Victoria sat back in her chair.

She took a slow sip of tea.

Ashley giggled and moved closer.

"Auntie is amazing, keeping him so well-behaved!"

...

The lab couldn't be borrowed.

Caleb refused to cancel the application.

They had to find another way.

Hannah Morse was so angry she skipped dinner.

"This is too much! Absolutely bullying!"

"Won't the school do anything?!"

Marcus Lawrence adjusted his glasses.

"The school only cares about academic results. Caleb's paperwork is compliant. The administration has no reason to intervene."

Hannah propped her chubby face in her hands.

"No lab, how do we proceed with the project?"

Marcus shook his head.

"The key isn't the lab, it's the CPRT Dynamometer."

With the equipment, any lab could be used.

Hannah suddenly asked.

"Is that dynamometer expensive?"

Sophia was stunned.

Marcus paused for two seconds.

"That question… is interesting!"

He immediately took out his phone to check.

"High-spec model with microscope from Everysto in Germany. Market price is 1.26 million."

"1.26 million…" Hannah thought for a moment. "How about we just buy one ourselves?"

Marcus: "?" Did he hear correctly?

Sophia: "!" That's actually a solution!

Marcus stared at Hannah.

"Did you hear the price clearly? 1.26 million, not 126 dollars."

Hannah nodded.

"I heard clearly."

"So you still think… we can buy it?"

"Not us, me. I'll handle it." She patted her chest.

Marcus thought either Hannah was crazy, or he was hallucinating.

"Where would you get that much money?" How could she boast so wildly?

Hannah blinked.

"I don't have money."

Marcus looked as if that confirmed his thoughts.

"But my dad does!"

"?"

She took out her phone and dialed.

"Hey! Pops!"

"My good daughter finally called! Your old man is so touched!"

"Pops, I need money, can you send some over?"

"How much?"

"One million should do."

She still had five hundred thousand in spending money in her card.

Together it was enough.
###Chapter 207
Contact Sebastian Evans Directly.

Her phone screen lit up.

A crisp notification sound chimed.

Hannah Morse looked down.

A bank transfer notification appeared prominently.

Henry Lorenz's voice came through the receiver. "Sweetie, did you get the money?"

"Got it!"

The amount wasn't one million.

It was one point five million.

Pops had transferred an extra five hundred thousand.

Hannah couldn't help but smile.

"Eat well every day. Don't skimp. Tell me if you need more money!"

"Okay!"

The call ended.

She put her phone away.

She looked up and met two pairs of eyes.

Marcus Lawrence and Sophia Sullivan were staring at her.

Hannah blinked. "The money's here. Why are you looking at me like that?"

Marcus crossed his arms. "Miss Morse, you aren't being entirely honest."

"?"

"You said your family lives in a village?"

Hannah nodded. "Yeah, an urban village. Surrounded by shopping districts and mansions. Very bustling!"

Marcus fell silent.

Sophia asked softly. "Parents are unemployed? In charge of watching a building?"

"Right. My family has over eighty buildings for rent collection. Pops deals with tenant issues every day. Fixing pipes, checking meters. It's similar to property management work."

Being his own boss.

Sophia was speechless.

Marcus raised an eyebrow. "Going out to sea to fish?"

Hannah laughed. "Mom loves throwing parties on the yacht. Dad is passionate about deep-sea fishing. So they go out on the boat often."

Yacht.

The word made both of them pause.

Marcus took a deep breath. "So... your family isn't poor?"

Hannah's eyes widened in surprise. "Why would you think my family is poor?"

Marcus's gaze swept over her T-shirt, shorts, and flip-flops.

She didn't even wear Crocs anymore.

She ran around in flip-flops all day.

"Your outfit really doesn't scream wealthy."

Hannah glared. "Marcus! Everyone dresses like this in summer where I'm from! My dad collects rent in flip-flops every day!"

Daily rent collection.

Sophia and Marcus exchanged a look.

They both fell silent simultaneously.

So they had misunderstood from the very beginning.

"The money's enough now. When are we buying the instrument?" Hannah rubbed her hands together excitedly.

Sophia thought for a moment. "This is a group project. The cost should be split equally."

Marcus nodded. "Forty-two thousand each."

Sophia said, "No problem."

Hannah suddenly narrowed her eyes. "You said I wasn't honest? You two are the ones hiding your depths, aren't you?"

Marcus coughed lightly. "Saved-up New Year's money."

Sophia said calmly, "Earned it myself."

Getting a substantial breakup settlement was a skill.

No issue there.

The money was pooled.

But a new problem arose.

The CPRT dynamometer was a high-end instrument with a very niche market.

It was difficult to purchase commercially.

Marcus found the sales number.

The call went to a disconnected line.

She frowned. "I'll ask my family elders. See if they have any channels."

Sophia nodded. "I'll try to find out too."

Hannah raised her hand. "What about me?"

"You're in charge of the money."

That afternoon.

Forty-two thousand was transferred to Hannah's account successively.

Looking at her bank balance.

She happily took a bite of a cookie.

Even though her family had money.

She would always love money.

She got that from her pops.

...

Sophia discovered the domestic distributor for the CPRT was Helios Technologies.

The major shareholder of this company was Leo Young.

Through layers of connections.

She found a familiar name—

Charlie Lowell.

The call connected quickly.

"Sophia? What's up?"

Sophia chuckled. "How have you been?"

"Don't ask. Fractured my leg. Been stuck in the hospital for a week."

"Serious?"

"Need to rest. I'm so bored."

Sophia advised, "Rest properly. Don't try to walk too soon."

"Got it. Did you need something, Sophia?"

Sophia explained her purpose.

Charlie was confused. "CPRT? I only know CPR..."

Sophia patiently explained, "It's a type of bio-measurement instrument."

"Helios Technologies..."

"Yes."

"I invested in that company. But just as a follow-on investor. Not involved in operations."

"Julian Winston is the main person. He went heavy on the tech sector. He should know more."

"You could ask him."

"Thanks. Rest well."

"Don't mention it~"

She hung up.

Sophia called Julian Winston directly.

He answered quickly.

The background was quiet.

"Mr. Winston."

"So formal, Sophia~"

The nickname made her skin crawl.

"Politeness is better."

"Come on. I'm your best friend's boyfriend now. By seniority, shouldn't you call me brother-in-law?"

The relationship was dizzyingly complicated.

Sophia got straight to the point. "I need to ask you something."

"Go ahead."

She briefly explained the situation.

Julian confirmed, "Helios Technologies?"

"Yes."

"Need to find their boss?"

"Mm."

"Then you should just call Sebastian Evans directly."
###Chapter 208

Sophia Sullivan froze.

Julian Winston raised an eyebrow. "He is the boss."

After all that, it turned out to be someone she knew.

She hung up and sighed, resigned to her fate as she dialed Sebastian Evans's number.

That day, when she said, "You're too calculating, let's keep our distance," she wasn't joking.

A fox is too cunning. One moment of carelessness, and you fall into its trap.

The safest solution Sophia could think of was simple.

Stay away.

But right after saying that, she was the one reaching out.

It was truly embarrassing.

…

Julian put away his phone and looked at Olivia Lopez sleeping soundly on the bed. His anger instantly flared.

"Who was it that said they'd be on time? Not a minute late?"

"And the result? I'm here, and you're still asleep! I waited forty minutes, Olivia Lopez! Does your conscience not hurt at all?"

The person on the bed rolled over and continued sleeping.

Julian was fuming.

He walked to the bedside. "Did you go out partying again last night?"

His eyes scanned every corner of the room.

Luckily, there were no signs of a man.

Suddenly, his gaze halted.

There were two water glasses on the nightstand.

A furious, inexplicable heat surged in Julian's chest.

"O—liv—ia—Lopez!"

A pillow flew over, hitting him squarely on the head.

Olivia sat up, her face full of irritation. "What's all the noise? Wait if you can, if not, get out!"

No one was allowed to disturb her sleep.

Julian laughed in anger. "And you have the nerve to be righteous?"

"Get out!"

Julian almost lost it.

Fine! He'd go! Who was afraid of who!

He turned to leave but suddenly stopped.

"Dammit—"

Julian cursed under his breath.

Half an hour later, Olivia finally woke up.

She yawned, casually smoothing her messy hair, looking lazy and content.

Her movements suddenly paused. "...Why are you still here?"

Julian sat on the sofa opposite, speaking quietly. "Leave, and let my mom meet thin air?"

A week ago, Julian's mother had invited Olivia over for the weekend.

Olivia had readily agreed.

Today was the weekend.

Yesterday, Julian called to confirm. Olivia was busy and tossed out a sentence: "Nine tomorrow morning. Be a minute late, just you wait."

And the result?

He was on time. She was fast asleep.

Olivia looked blank. "...Did I say nine o'clock?"

Julian sneered. "Need me to play the recording?"

He started reaching for his phone.

"You're sick, recording phone calls?"

"Better safe than sorry. See? It came in handy."

Olivia: "..." So sarcastic.

"Fine, I forgot... Wait, how did you get into my house?" She realized it belatedly.

Julian: "I typed in the password."

"How do you know my password?"

"That night at the bar, you told me yourself. Forgot?"

"Did I?"

"Of course! Bad temper, bad memory. What's wrong with you?"

Olivia threw another pillow at him. "Shut up!"

Julian tilted his head to avoid it, his movements practiced.

Olivia reached for another pillow—

"Don't bother looking, it's here." Julian patted behind him.

Olivia was stunned. "How did you get that?"

Julian: "..." Bad memory, confirmed.

"Miss, this is the second pillow. You're welcome."

"...Oh."

A little awkward.

Olivia: "What time is it now?"

"...Ten-thirty." Still poking his sore spot.

"No rush. Taking time to dress up nicely to meet the future mother-in-law is normal, right?"

"..."

"Get me a—"

Julian finished her sentence: "Water, right?"

He picked up a glass from the vanity, already filled with water.

"Drink up, then get ready to go!"

Olivia took the glass. It was warm to the touch. "Warm water?"

"Yeah!"

Don't all girls drink warm water?

Olivia: "Get me a glass of ice water."

"Drinking something ice-cold first thing in the morning? Can you handle that?" Even though he drank ice-cold stuff himself.

But she was a woman!

"What's wrong with being a woman?" Olivia rolled her eyes. "Who says women have to drink warm water? Ridiculous!"

"All my..." Uh!

"Ex-girlfriends?" Olivia finished with a smile.

Julian: "..."

"Idiot!"

"Why do you always curse?"

"Did your ex-girlfriends drink bubble tea? Eat sushi? Like ice-cold cocktails?"

"...Why are you asking?"

"Aren't all those things ice-cold or cool? Did they eat them?"

Uh!

Julian was stumped.

Olivia stretched, threw off the covers, and got out of bed. "Is drinking warm water the badge of a good woman? Well, I don't like it. So what?"

Julian said quietly, "So you're not a good woman."

"Want a beating?"

He instinctively stepped back.

"Go get the ice water. I'm changing clothes. Those two glasses on the nightstand are from a few days ago; I forgot to put them away. Take them to the kitchen; the housekeeper will wash them."

Julian: "Both glasses are yours?"

"Of course! Who else? A ghost?"

"Heh... Wait, I'll go get the water!"

Olivia: "...?"

Why is he giggling over getting water?

By the time Julian returned with the ice water, Olivia had already changed.

She stood before the floor-to-ceiling window, the curtains wide open.

Sunlight poured in, covering the wooden floor in gold dust.

The woman stood in the golden light, a blue ankle-length dress hugging her curves. Hearing his footsteps, she turned to look.

Backlit, light and shadow played across her figure, creating a stark contrast.

Like an immortal, yet also a temptress.

For a moment, Julian's breath caught.

He stood frozen, clearly hearing his own abnormal heartbeat.

Thump-thump…

Once, twice…

###Chapter 209

Olivia Lopez had just set down her water glass.

Her phone rang abruptly.

She walked to the floor-to-ceiling window to answer.

"Hello?"

"...Miss Lopez, do you still remember me? Cody."

Olivia narrowed her eyes.

Memories of that night at the hotel instantly surfaced.

The corner of her mouth lifted slightly. "Of course I remember."

"You never contacted me after that day... I thought you forgot."

The puppy-dog voice sounded wounded.

Olivia's heart softened a little.

"You didn't leave your number."

"I left a note on the nightstand."

She thought carefully.

She genuinely hadn't noticed any note that night.

"It's fine, we're connected now, aren't we?"

The puppy-dog voice grew even more dejected. "I stared at my phone every day, hesitating... It took all my courage to call you."

Olivia's smile deepened. "Now I feel bad for you."

"Really?"

"Truer than diamonds." She said without batting an eye.

"Then... can we meet again?"

Olivia was about to answer.

A sharp clatter rang out.

She whipped her head around.

Julian Winston stood behind her.

His expression was dark.

It was unclear how long he had been listening.

For the first time, Olivia felt a pang of guilt.

The Winston family home was different from a hotel, after all.

She had to be more discreet under the elders' watchful eyes.

"Julian, I—"

The man suddenly closed the distance.

His arm encircled her waist.

He pulled her sharply into his embrace.

His breath was close.

Their gazes locked tightly.

Olivia frowned, ready to get angry.

"You—"

"Look up." He murmured in a low voice.

Olivia looked up.

She froze instantly.

Penelope and Martha stood on the second floor.

They were talking while looking down at them.
###Chapter 210

They were staring, to be precise.
Staring at her and Julian Winston.

Olivia Lopez: "Those two are so lovey-dovey."
Martha: "It's the first time the young master has been so enthusiastic about a girl."
Olivia Lopez: "Olivia isn't an ordinary girl. Her family background and refinement are outstanding. That boy finally has good taste."
"He knows how to focus on what's important."
"If they work out, I'll be laughing in my sleep."
"Does the young master look a bit stiff?"

Olivia Lopez squinted for a closer look.
"Olivia's body is tense too."

They were close, but it felt strange.

Downstairs, Julian Winston whispered, "Don't move. My mother is watching."
Olivia Lopez: "When did your mother get here?"
"She was here before you answered the phone."
Oh no. She felt even more guilty.

Olivia Lopez muttered, "Just hugging? Not kissing?"
Her words clearly reached Olivia Lopez's ears.

Olivia Lopez was always bold and decisive.
She looked up and met Julian's gaze directly. "Kiss me."

The man's Adam's apple bobbed.
His eyes darkened instantly, like a turbulent abyss.

He suddenly gripped her waist.
He lowered his head and kissed her.

Olivia Lopez froze.
Their lips met, warm and wet.

"Oh! They really kissed! Let's go, let's go. Don't disturb the young people."
The sound of footsteps faded away.

Slap!
A crisp sound.

Julian Winston was stunned. "You hit me?"
Olivia Lopez's legs felt weak. "Who told you to actually kiss me?"
That slap was just to push him away.
It wasn't a real slap.

"Wasn't it your request?"
Olivia Lopez gritted her teeth. "It was just an act!"
"My mother is sharp. Would a fake kiss have fooled her?"
Damn acting for real.

Julian Winston snorted coldly. "I'm the one at a loss for kissing you. Plenty of women are lining up begging for my kiss."
Olivia Lopez gave a fake smile. "What a coincidence. Plenty of men want to kiss me too."
The man was speechless.

After a long moment, he said quietly, "Is their technique better than mine?"
Olivia Lopez: "You're very average. I've experienced better."
Julian's face darkened.

Olivia Lopez's voice came from upstairs. "Olivia, time for your treatment—"
"Coming right away!"

Olivia Lopez turned to grab her phone from the couch.
Her puppy had sounded so pitiful earlier. She needed to reply to his message.

Julian Winston snatched the phone first.
Olivia Lopez: "Give it back."
Julian Winston: "No phones during beauty treatments. Focus on accompanying my mother. Don't slip up."
That made some sense.

Olivia Lopez turned and went upstairs.
Julian Winston stared at the phone, clenching his jaw.

...

Early morning, Sophia Sullivan headed to school.
She glanced at the neighboring unit—

The door was closed. It was quiet.
She suddenly realized she hadn't seen Alexander Laurent for a long time.

She used to run into him often when going out.
But recently, there had been no sign of him.

Maybe he was busy and staying at the lab.
Sophia didn't think much of it.

She returned from the library at eight in the evening.
As she entered the building, a figure brushed past her—

Alexander Laurent was out for a night run.
She quickly called out, "Professor—"

The man didn't react at all and ran straight ahead.
Sophia was stunned.

Was her voice too soft? Or was he wearing headphones?
She went home and changed into workout clothes, planning to go for a run.

She could also ask Alexander Laurent about purchasing a CPRT Dynamometer.
Buying the equipment made her think of Alexander Laurent and Professor Eleanor Watson first.

Professor Eleanor Watson's health wasn't great. She often went to the hospital. Sophia didn't want to bother her.
If word got out that she was buying the equipment with her own money, the scandal of Professor Victoria Lowell monopolizing the lab would also be exposed.

Given the old lady's temper, she would definitely rush to the hospital to confront the department.
The department clearly favored Professor Victoria Lowell.

Professor Eleanor Watson would only get more upset and harm her health.
It was better to ask Alexander Laurent.

But he hadn't replied to her messages. Her calls went unanswered.
Sophia guessed he was too busy.

It was rare to run into him today.
She had already arranged to meet Sebastian Evans tomorrow, but she still preferred asking Alexander Laurent.

She had thought about the reason.
Perhaps it was because Alexander Laurent was upright and reliable. His help made her feel secure.

She didn't have to worry about owing a favor or how to repay it.
As for Sebastian Evans…

His intentions were too obvious. Too direct.
So direct it made her retreat.

Sophia searched along her usual running route.
She circled twice but didn't see Alexander Laurent.

She ran another lap. Still no sign of him.
She had done enough exercise and was sweating. She headed home.

The door was slightly ajar.
She rinsed the rice and peeled the yam, setting the timer. There would be hot porridge tomorrow morning.

She kept an ear out for any movement outside the door.
After cleaning the kitchen, the neighboring unit was still quiet.

Sophia knocked directly on the door. "Professor Laurent, are you home? I have something to ask."
No answer.

"Professor?"
Still no sound.

Had he not returned? Or had he left again?

...

At the lab—
Professor Quincy Evans' eyes widened. "You're back?"
Alexander Laurent: "Working overtime."
"You've been pulling all-nighters for three days. You said you'd rest tonight. You just left a few hours ago and you're back to work overtime?"
Alexander Laurent: "Is there a problem?"
Professor Quincy Evans: "I think you're the one with the problem."

Alexander Laurent fell silent.
###Chapter 211

The Woman I Like

Quincy Evans set down the test tube in his hand.

He looked at Alexander Laurent.

"Something's off with you lately."

Alexander didn't look up.

"You're imagining things."

He turned and walked toward the break room.

Clean clothes were stored in the cabinet.

He pushed the door open.

A folding bed stood quietly in the corner.

Sophia Sullivan had napped here once.

He had stumbled upon her.

His heartbeat instantly spiraled out of control.

His breathing grew labored.

Just like those unspeakable dreams.

Alexander squeezed his eyes shut.

Frustration washed over him.

He despised this version of himself.

"Alex, the late-night food is here." Quincy called from outside the door.

"Not hungry."

"It's all your favorite dishes."

"No appetite."

"Sigh... If only little Sophia were here. Her Kung Pao chicken was the best." Quincy sighed. "She hasn't been by since the semester started. Remember to invite her over when you see her."

Alexander walked out of the break room.

His expression was calm.

"Tell her yourself."

Her shadow was everywhere.

Quincy put down his chopsticks.

"Aren't you neighbors? Is it that hard to pass along a message?"

Alexander: "Yes."

Quincy was speechless.

He stared at Alexander.

"There's definitely something wrong with you."

Alexander had already returned to the lab bench.

Quincy muttered, "Could it be a broken heart..."

Alexander's movements didn't pause.

Quincy shook his head.

"Here we go again."

...

The next evening at dusk.

The sky was painted with brilliant clouds.

A canvas of blue stained with gold and orange.

A gentle evening breeze stirred.

The city lights began to twinkle.

Inside a private room at Chez Maurice.

Sophia Sullivan pushed the door open.

Sebastian Evans had been waiting for some time.

She had just taken her seat.

Dishes began arriving at the table.

The timing was impeccable.

"Sorry to keep you waiting."

Sebastian glanced at his wristwatch.

"You're ten minutes early."

They had agreed on 6:30.

She arrived at 6:20.

"When did you get here?"

Sebastian: "Six o'clock."

"So early?"

"This restaurant doesn't have a fixed menu. The preparation methods need to be discussed in advance."

Stir-frying to order takes time.

Without prior arrangement, the wait would be long.

Sophia looked at the dining table.

The ingredients were fresh.

The preparation was exquisite.

"I should have been the one to arrange this..."

Sebastian had chosen the place.

She hadn't looked into it beforehand.

Sebastian smiled. "I enjoy taking care of things for you."

Sophia fell silent.

The man's smile remained. "Let's eat first."

"Um..."

"Yes?" Sebastian looked at her.

Sophia: "I brought two classmates. Is that alright?"

The man raised an eyebrow. "Of course. Have they arrived?"

"They should be here soon."

As the words left her mouth.

The private room door was pushed open.

Hannah Morse entered first.

She came face to face with Sebastian.

Her eyes lit up.

Marcus Lawrence followed behind.

He paused for a moment upon seeing Sebastian.

His gaze lingered for two extra seconds.

Sebastian noticed the appraisal.

He returned the look calmly.

"Please, have a seat."

"Thank you."

Hannah and Marcus sat down next to Sophia.

Sebastian called the server.

"Two more place settings, please. And add two more dishes to the order."

"Any dietary restrictions?"

Sebastian looked at the two newcomers.

Hannah: "I want meat."

Marcus: "No seafood."

"Very good."

The server withdrew.

The door to the private room closed.

Sebastian looked at Sophia.

"Aren't you going to introduce us? Sophia?"

Sophia?

Hannah blinked.

Marcus's gaze shifted slightly.

Sophia's expression remained placid.

"My classmates, Marcus Lawrence, Hannah Morse."

She gestured toward Sebastian.

"My friend, Sebastian Evans."

"Sophia rarely asks me out." Sebastian chuckled lightly. "So, you've run into some trouble?"

He said "you all."

Not just Sophia.

His perception was startling.

Hannah and Marcus exchanged a glance.

They remained silent.

Sophia: "I'll explain..."

"So, you want to purchase a CPRT Dynamometer from Helios Technologies using your own funds?"

"Yes."

Sebastian pondered for a moment.

"Does the Institute know?"

Sophia shook her head. "We haven't spoken to them yet."

It was still uncertain if the instrument could even be purchased.

"Self-funding is possible. Helios can sell it to you. But the Institute must be informed to avoid complications later."

Hannah was confused. "We're paying for it ourselves. What is there to worry about?"

"The instrument will ultimately be housed in the Institute's lab." Sebastian said calmly. "You're footing the bill. Don't you want to deal with the people who caused this trouble?"

Hannah's eyes lit up. "There's a way to teach them a lesson?"

Sebastian: "Leave it to me."

Hannah exclaimed, "Mr. Evans, you're amazing!"

Sebastian looked at Sophia.

"Do you agree, Sophia?"

Sophia was silent.

He was clearly doing this on purpose.

His considerations were so thorough.

What reason did she have left to refuse?

Sebastian smiled. "Silence means consent. The price for the instrument... How about half off?"

Hannah's eyes went wide. "Half off? Really?"

They would save six hundred and thirty thousand instantly.

Sophia and Marcus frowned simultaneously.

Sophia: "We can't let you take a loss. Market price, please."

Marcus nodded. "Agreed."

Sebastian: "Half off is the internal price. Don't think too highly of me. I never do business at a loss."

With the serious matter concluded.

Everyone picked up their chopsticks.

Hannah tried a couple of bites.

Her eyes sparkled. "This is delicious! How have I never heard of this place?"

"They're not on public review sites. They don't offer delivery."

"So mysterious?"

Sophia looked at him.

Sebastian chuckled lightly. "Otherwise, how could it be called a private kitchen?"

The meal was enjoyed by all.

Hannah ate the most.

Sophia stepped out of the private room.

She intended to settle the bill.

But was told—

"Mr. Evans has already taken care of it."

Sebastian's voice came from behind her—

"I thought you were going to the restroom?"

Sophia turned around.

She met the man's smiling eyes.

"I said I was treating."

Sebastian spread his hands. "Can't be helped. I never let a woman pay the bill."

His gaze was deep.

"Especially a woman I like."
###Chapter 212
Sophia Sullivan spoke softly. "Habits can be changed."

"For others, maybe. Not for you."

"..."

The three of them walked out of the restaurant.

Hannah Morse took out her phone to book a ride.

A black Mercedes-Benz slowly pulled over.

The window rolled down. Sebastian Evans's gaze settled on Sophia. "Get in. I'll drive you."

Hannah looked at Sophia.

Sebastian chuckled lightly. "The wait for a ride at this hour is over two hours."

Marcus Lawrence stood silently.

Hannah checked the app. 216 people were in the queue ahead.

It really would take a long time.

Sophia opened the car door. "Thank you, Mr. Evans."

The corner of Sebastian's mouth lifted. "You're welcome, Sophia."

"..."

The navigation indicated Sophia would be dropped off first.

But at an intersection, Sebastian took the wrong lane.

The route was recalculated.

Hannah first, then Marcus, and finally Sophia.

The car stopped at the mouth of the alley.

Sebastian got out and opened her door. "Watch your step."

Sophia stood firm. "Thank you."

"For the ride? Or for buying the instrument?"

"Both."

"Aren't you going to invite me up for tea?"

Sophia was silent.

"I'm joking. Don't think of me as a bad guy."

Sophia looked directly at him. "Are you?"

The man laughed softly. "No. But I'd like to be. And I don't dare to be."

"I don't understand."

"Maybe it's better that you don't."

Some things don't need a reason.

Just like he didn't understand why he kept thinking of Sophia Sullivan.

That first time he saw her at the school gate, it wasn't just Ethan Roscente whose heart skipped a beat.

It was him too.

And Daniel Anderson.

Ethan moved the fastest.

Daniel was close behind.

He hesitated and missed his chance.

By the time he heard the news, the two were already together.

He never thought Ethan would be serious.

He never thought he'd succeed.

In that moment, Sebastian understood. Opportunities are fleeting.

But he always believed there would be a second chance.

Because he knew Ethan too well.

He knew his true nature never changes.

All he had to do was wait.

Wait for the relationship to break. Wait for Sophia to give up.

Finally, he had waited.

"If not tea, then a simple 'goodnight' will do?"

Sophia said, "Goodnight, Mr. Evans."

"Drop the title."

"...Goodnight."

"So good."

He quickly ruffled her hair.

By the time Sophia stepped back, he had already turned to leave.

He didn't look back, just waved his hand.

Sophia gritted her teeth.

Ethan Roscente saw it all.

Red roses fell from his arms.

He rushed out of the alley.

"Sebastian Evans—"

Sebastian paused, his hand on the car door.

A fist came flying towards his face.

It grazed his cheekbone.

The dull thud was unnaturally clear in the night air.

Ethan threw another punch.

Sebastian grabbed his collar and hit back.

The two men scuffled together.

Sebastian wiped blood from his lip. "Saw everything, did you?"

Ethan's eyes were bloodshot.

"You can't handle this? There will be more intimacy in the future. Will you fight every time?"

"It's useless. You can't stop it."

Ethan suddenly calmed. "Did she agree to be with you?"

Sebastian's smile stiffened slightly.

Ethan sneered. "I see. She didn't. You couldn't catch her then. What makes you think you can win now?"

"I at least had her for six years. You? You don't even dare to touch her carefully."

"Are you that happy picking up someone else's castoffs?"

Sebastian suddenly grabbed his collar. "Say that again."

"Isn't it the truth?"

Sebastian's eyes turned icy. "Say whatever you want about me. Don't insult her."

"She gave you six years of her youth. She gave you all her love."

Ethan let himself be grabbed, a mocking smile on his lips. "Admit it. You're just jealous of me."

"Jealous? Why would I be jealous of trash who couldn't keep her?"

Sebastian spoke each word clearly. "I just feel sorry for her. For having loved garbage like you!"

A punch landed on Ethan's nose.

"That's for her."

Another punch hit his cheekbone.

"And that's payback."

"You're dead—"

Ethan immediately fought back.

Two men in tailored suits brawled at the alley's entrance.

Charlie Lowell and Julian Winston arrived.

"I knew something would happen!"

"Stop them! Quick!"

They rushed forward to pull them apart.

Charlie held Ethan tightly. "Calm down!"

Julian blocked Sebastian. "Enough!"

Ethan roared. "I'm going to kill him!"

Sebastian laughed coldly. "I just need to take out the trash!"

"Who are you calling trash?!"

"Whoever answers!"

Just as they were about to start again, Julian suddenly shouted—

"Sophia Sullivan, you're here…"

Both men froze instantly.
###Chapter 213

Sophia? Are you there?

They both turned their heads at the same time.

Sophia Sullivan wasn't there.

Julian Winston spread his hands. "If I hadn't said that, would you two have stopped?"

Ethan Roscente: "..."

Sebastian Evans: "."

"You're adults. Can't you solve problems maturely?"

Sebastian said, "He threw the first punch."

Ethan retorted, "He deserved it!"

"Enough. Both of you, calm down. If you really draw Sophia here, no one will get off easy."

Sebastian pressed his lips together.

Ethan fell silent.

Charlie Lowell tried to mediate. "Let's go to the hospital to get those wounds treated."

"No need," Ethan said coldly, his gaze sweeping over Sebastian. "You won't get her. Give up now."

"Oh?" Sebastian chuckled lightly. "How do you know without trying? I haven't even decided if I'll pursue her yet. But you—you lost your chance a long time ago."

Ethan's eyes reddened. He moved forward again, but Charlie stopped him.

Sebastian tossed out four words. "Pathetic rage."

He pulled open the car door and drove off.

Ethan shook off Charlie's hold. "He's gone. Why are you still holding me back?"

Charlie sighed. "Ethan, why do this?"

Ethan glared at him, eyes still red. "You should be asking Sebastian that!"

They were once brothers. Why did he have to set his sights on Sophia?

With that, he also got into his car and left.

Only Charlie and Julian were left, looking at each other.

Charlie said, "This leaves a bad taste."

Julian replied, "They're losing it. There's nothing we can do."

Charlie asked, "Why Sebastian? Why Sophia?"

Julian paused.

Almost without thinking, he said, "Liking someone never makes sense."

Charlie: "?" That's not what you used to say!

What about all the other fish in the sea?

Brothers before others?

And that line: Plenty of women out there, a new one every day!

...

The morning sun streamed down.

The sky was blue with white clouds, and cicadas chirped.

In the lab, Professor Quincy Evans woke up.

He sat up, gathered himself for a moment, and walked out of the break room.

"Whoa! Alex, you're up this early? Or did you not sleep at all?"

At the experimental bench, Alexander Laurent was focused on his work, not looking up.

Until—

The operation finished. He took off his protective suit and gloves.

"Woke up early."

"What time?"

"Five-thirty."

Quincy swallowed. "That's too hardcore. I need to go home today. I can't keep this up. I'll come back tonight. Lend me your charger; my phone's dead."

"In the cabinet. Get it yourself."

"You left it on the bench after using it. Isn't it a hassle putting it back in the cabinet every time?"

It wasn't a hassle at all.

Because Alexander hadn't touched his phone for days.

After putting it on silent, he'd tossed it directly into the cabinet.

Quincy found the charger. "Alex, you have missed calls. I brought your phone over."

"Thanks." Alexander took it.

The next second, he froze.

Sophia had called?

Two calls.

He opened WeChat. Sure enough, there were messages—

[Professor, I have something I'd like to ask you. Are you free?]

Sent five days ago.

He hadn't seen it at all!

Alexander immediately started typing a reply.

He thought for a moment, then put the phone down. Maybe he should just go back. It was Sunday; she should be home.

"Quincy, I'm leaving. The data for group three will be ready soon. Keep an eye on it."

He made to leave.

"Wait... I said I was going home! Hey—where are you going? Did I agree?! I told you to rest yesterday and you wouldn't listen! Now you're stealing my time?!"

"Alexander Laurent—you're really something!"

...

Back home, he knocked on the neighbor's door.

There was no response for a long time.

"Sophia? Are you there?"

Silence.

Alexander sighed, went back to his own apartment, sat down, and sent a WeChat—

[Sorry, I was in the lab and didn't check my phone.]

[Can I still help with anything?]

He waited half an hour. No reply.

Alexander couldn't help but wonder. When she sent the message, did her expectation slowly turn to disappointment too?

Sophia truly couldn't reply.

She was busy cleaning and setting up the new lab.

Marcus Lawrence had specifically applied for the largest and most remote room.

The teacher had confirmed multiple times, worried he was being impulsive.

This lab had been vacant for a long time, hardly ever used.

It was too big, lacked equipment, and was too far from the teaching buildings.

Marcus insisted. "This is the one."

It was spacious enough to section off a break area.

Lacking equipment? They could buy their own.

It was far from the teaching buildings, but close to the cafeteria. Hannah Morse was thrilled.

For the three of them, the only downside was—

It was incredibly hard to clean!

After a whole morning of work, they had barely managed to arrange the lab benches, cabinets, coffee table, and water dispenser.

Next was the actual cleaning.

Hannah groaned. "I'm exhausted. Why won't the school let us hire a cleaning service?"

Marcus replied, "It wouldn't look good."

"Look bad for what?"

"The spirit and vitality of university students."

"..." Fine, you win.

The three went to eat first, planning to continue in the afternoon.

Just as they reached the cafeteria entrance, Sophia saw Alexander walking towards them.

She was hesitating whether to greet him when the man was already in front of her, slightly out of breath—

"Sophia, what did you need?"

Sophia was stunned, not processing it immediately.

Hannah and Marcus exchanged a look.

Alexander said, "I'm sorry. I was in the lab the past few days. I didn't check my phone. I didn't reply to your message in time."

Sophia suddenly remembered. She had sent a WeChat, but he hadn't replied. He must have been busy.

She'd forgotten about it later herself.

"There was something, but it's already resolved."

Sebastian had messaged her this morning. The CPRT dynamometer would arrive tomorrow.

"...Why pay for it yourself? What happened?"

Alexander asked. Before Sophia could answer, Hannah launched into a rapid-fire explanation like a little machine gun.

"...Professor Victoria Lowell?"

"Yes! Her! The department is siding with her too, bullying us!" Hannah said through gritted teeth.
###Chapter 214

Hannah Morse didn't know Alexander Laurent.

She also didn't know his relationship with Sophia Sullivan.

But no matter who he was.

Nothing could stop her urge to vent.

Lunch ended.

The three returned to the lab.

Hannah planted her hands on her hips and sighed. "What's the use of a big space? Cleaning it is a nightmare..."

Before she could finish.

"Excuse me, is this C116?"

Two cleaning ladies stood at the door.

Holding cleaning supplies.

"...Huh? Yes, who are you looking for?"

"Then this is the right place! Let's get to work."

The other lady quickly responded.

They began cleaning with efficient movements.

Hannah blinked. "Ma'am, are you sure you have the right room?"

"Of course. The Dean's Office notified us to clean C116."

The Dean's Office?

Hannah and Sophia simultaneously looked at Marcus Lawrence.

Marcus shook his head.

He didn't have that kind of pull.

"Who called them? We didn't tell anyone. Whatever, having help cleaning is a lifesaver..."

Hannah pulled over a chair and sat down.

She tore open a bag of chips.

Offering some to Sophia and Marcus.

Sophia took one.

But her mind wasn't on the snack.

She had a guess about who was behind this.

Was this his way of making up for not being able to help earlier?

It really wasn't necessary...

Hannah nudged Marcus's shoulder. "Why aren't you eating?"

Marcus: "Watching my weight."

"...Starve then!"

...

School of Life Sciences office.

Blake Cunningham wiped cold sweat from his brow.

His smile was strained.

The man opposite him remained expressionless.

He cautiously probed, "Mr. Evans, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today...?"

"You don't know why I'm here?" Sebastian Evans sneereded. "Did the equipment donated by Helios Technologies go to the dogs?"

Blake's face fell. "What do you mean by that?"

Although he held the title of Vice Dean.

The School of Life Sciences had twelve Vice Deans.

Each managed their own area.

He was responsible for fundraising.

This position could be lucrative if played right.

Crumbs from entrepreneurs could fill you up.

But it was a different story if you messed up.

Blake thought he had a decent relationship with Sebastian Evans.

They laughed and talked at dinner parties.

Why today...

"Did we do something wrong? Please, tell me. I will definitely improve!"

Sebastian sneered. "How dare I offer opinions? The school's resources can be distributed however you want. Bully whoever you want."

"This is a misunderstanding!" Blake cried out in grievance. "We are always fair and just. All resources are allocated according to regulations. No favoritism."

"Really? But I heard someone is hogging a lab. Not using it themselves, and not letting others use it either. Originally, it was none of my business. But what was said when Helios donated the CPRT Dynamometer?"

"To create a fair experimental environment for every student. To contribute to scientific research. To fight for humanity's future."

"Now it's the complete opposite. The instruments I donated are not decorations. Nor are they bargaining chips for某些人 to fight over resources. Think carefully about this."

Sebastian enunciated each word clearly. "This concerns whether Helios will continue providing funding and resources in the future."

Blake's expression changed dramatically. "No, no, no! Let's discuss this properly!"

His mind raced.

Sebastian was clearly here to warn him.

The problem lay with the CPRT Dynamometer...

"Mr. Evans, rest assured. I understand your meaning. We firmly oppose academic misconduct. We will deal with it seriously."

Sebastian's expression softened slightly. "Director Cunningham never disappoints. That's why, out of all the school's leadership, you're the only one I'm willing to work with."

"Thank you for your high regard, Mr. Evans."

Sebastian stood up and left.

Blake personally saw him out.

Once the shadow disappeared.

His smile instantly collapsed.

Returning to his office.

He immediately called the Dean's Office. "Check the borrowing status for the CPRT Dynamometer lab."

The person on the phone paused. "One has always been used by Professor Lowell's team. The other... was just approved for Caleb Watson."

"Caleb Watson? Isn't he on Victoria Lowell's team?"

"Yes, I was also puzzled. They already have one, why apply for another? Professor Watson's graduate student also came to borrow it, but was a step too late..."

"Eleanor Watson also applied?"

"Yes, one right after the other."

No wonder!

Blake thought Eleanor Watson had used her influence to get Sebastian Evans to back her.

"Release that lab. Caleb Watson is being utterly ridiculous!"

He didn't mention Caleb's backing by Victoria Lowell.

"Okay."

Blake just hung up the phone.

He breathed a sigh of relief.

His office door was pushed open again.

The sweat on his forehead hadn't dried yet.

He forced another smile. "Professor Laurent! What brings you here? Please, have a seat."

Alexander Laurent didn't want to waste words.

He got straight to the point.

"School regulations clearly state: malicious hoarding of public resources is not allowed. Malicious rivalry between teams is not allowed. Director Cunningham should know this better than I do."

Blake's heart sank.

You've got to be kidding me.

Again?!

...

The two cleaning ladies worked quickly.

They cleaned the entire lab within an hour.

"Thank you, ma'am."

"You're welcome! It's our job!"

The ladies packed their tools and left.

To facilitate cleaning.

Some lab equipment was temporarily placed in the hallway.

Not much.

The three of them could move it back in a few trips.

"Well, if it isn't Professor Watson's prized student?"

A voice came from nearby.

The three turned.

Shane Holloway and Ashley Lowell stood not far away.

One wore a smirk, eyes full of mockery.

The other watched with arms crossed.

"So this is the lab you applied for? Let me see... Tch, all junk? Not a single decent instrument. Wasting such a big space."

Ashley lifted her chin. "Shane, what nonsense are you talking? The school's best equipment is all with our team. What good stuff could they possibly have?"

Shane: "A fine horse deserves a fine saddle. Inferior horses should just be淘汰ed. A waste of resources to keep them around."

Sophia smiled. "If you want to be livestock, don't drag others into it."

Hannah: "Yeah, refusing to be proper people, insisting on being horses. Tch, what were they thinking..."

"You—" Shane choked on his anger.

Ashley frowned. "All talk! Let's see how long you can keep up the bravado!"

Hannah pursed her lips. "Then keep your eyes wide open. Better protect those eyeballs, don't let them pop out."

Ashley sneereded.

"Talk is cheap. If it were useful, you wouldn't be moving your own stuff. Shane, let's go."

Shane scoffed. "Bumpkins! Serves you right for not getting a lab! Want to use the CPRT? We won't give it to you. Got the money to buy your own?"

Marcus: "Okay."

Sophia nodded. "We can do that."

Hannah: "Next-day delivery. Remember to come see it tomorrow."

Shane looked like he'd eaten something disgusting. "You're all sick! Completely insane!"

Buy one?

Did they think a CPRT Dynamometer was cabbage?

The next day.

The instrument passed by the academic building.

It was delivered to the lab by specialized personnel.

Among the crowd of onlookers.

Shane and Ashley could no longer laugh.
###Chapter 215

What is that?

It looks like lab equipment.

Foreign engineers delivered it personally.

They weren't just delivering.

They were also installing and calibrating.

This lab was always empty before.

Why add such a major piece suddenly?

Someone must be going to use it.

It's so expensive.

...

Whispers spread all around.

Shane Holloway's face grew increasingly grim.

Ashley Lowell squeezed to the front.

She stared at the instrument.

Her eyes wide with shock.

It was indeed a CPRT Dynamometer.

But it was different.

Its size was halved.

All buttons were touch-sensitive.

The display screen was twice as large.

This... this is the latest model?! Shane's voice trembled.

It was far more advanced than anything the institute currently had.

Its functions were more comprehensive too.

He rushed forward to confront them.

Where did you get this from?

Sophia Sullivan glanced up coolly.

Is that any of your business?

Shane was left speechless.

Hannah Morse nibbled on a biscuit.

She spoke with a smile.

Weren't you the one who told us to buy our own yesterday?

Well, we bought it.

Surprised?

Shocked?

You must be so happy for us, right?

Shane couldn't force a smile.

Ashley shook her head.

Impossible.

In such a short time.

Even if you bought it, it couldn't arrive this fast.

Marcus Lawrence let out a light scoff.

Never heard of pre-ordering?

No... it can't be...

Such an expensive instrument.

How could you just buy it like that?

The bigger blow was yet to come.

That afternoon.

The institute's official website posted a disciplinary notice.

Third-year graduate student Caleb Watson intentionally monopolized a laboratory.

Severely wasting academic resources.

This is a public criticism.

All faculty and students are urged to take this as a warning.

Crash—

Professor Victoria Lowell saw the notice.

She smashed her water glass directly.

She stormed into Blake Cunningham's office.

Looking down at him.

Director Cunningham.

Punishing my student.

Why wasn't I informed beforehand?

Blake Cunningham's expression didn't change.

It was the institute's decision.

Following standard procedure.

There's no requirement to inform the advisor.

Victoria let out a cold laugh.

Now you talk about procedure?

Don't you find that hypocritical?

Watch your tone.

Blake narrowed his eyes.

I am still the director.

Don't think your academic achievements let you do as you please.

If Caleb isn't punished.

Then who should be?

Have you thought about that?

Victoria froze completely.

The administration isn't unaware of your little games.

They turned a blind eye out of respect for your diligence.

Now that it's out in the open.

Sacrificing Caleb.

Lets you walk away unscathed.

What more are you unsatisfied with?

In just a few sentences.

Victoria was completely deflated.

In the dorm.

Caleb scanned the notice expressionlessly.

Jude Granger stood nearby.

Not daring to speak.

He clenched his fists anxiously.

Wanting to comfort but not daring to.

Caleb suddenly looked up.

Sophia and the others bought a CPRT with their own money?

The latest model?

Jude was stunned.

This wasn't the reaction he expected.

Caleb's eyes lit up.

Let's go take a look.

Bro, you just got disciplined.

The crowd outside the lab had dispersed.

Sophia and the other two weren't there.

Only the foreign engineers were calibrating the instrument.

The door was open.

After politely asking permission, Caleb entered.

He and Jude approached.

Their gazes full of awe.

It really was the latest model.

Many optimizations.

He instinctively reached out to touch it.

But stopped himself.

Jude hadn't started his project yet.

He didn't understand the instrument's special features.

But seeing Caleb's expression.

He looked at it a few more times too.

Bro, is it expensive?

Very.

How much?

Over a million, probably.

Jude was dumbfounded.

That's terrifying.

Something so expensive.

Just bought like that.

Three people.

Over a million.

Jude thought of his parents.

Toiling under the sun.

Saving a few thousand in the best years.

This instrument cost over a million.

Jude stood there in a daze.

Voices came from the hallway.

Hannah's voice.

They were coming back.

Caleb and Jude slipped out quietly through the back door.

Before leaving, Caleb glanced back.

In the sunlight, Sophia, Hannah, and Marcus walked over, laughing.

Sophia carried bottled water.

Evian.

Expensive.

Hannah held a pile of snacks.

The packaging was all in English.

Imported.

Not cheap.

Marcus drank a sports drink.

Unfamiliar packaging.

An unknown taste.

Bro, what are you thinking about?

They reached the bottom of the stairs.

Jude bumped his shoulder.

Caleb gave a light laugh.

It's really good.

Jude sighed.

The new instrument.

Of course it's good.

Caleb smiled without speaking.

He said it wasn't the instrument.

It was their courage to resist.

Their capital to argue.

Their financial ability to pay.

It's really good.

Inside the lab.

Sophia offered water.

Here, have some water first, everyone.

Hannah distributed snacks.

I have some food here too.

...

Professor Eleanor Watson found out on the third day.

The old lady trembled with anger.

This Victoria Lowell!

How could she do this?

Such a big thing happened to you.

Why didn't you tell me?

I'm old and not in good health.

But I'm not dead yet.

Sophia quickly cut her off.

Don't talk about dying.

Knock on wood—

If you'd just said something.

Why resort to spending your own money on a new one out of spite?

It wasn't just spite.

Sophia explained.

The new model is much better than the old one.

The efficiency is greatly improved.

Hannah nodded.

The money was well spent!

Marcus agreed.

The new instrument is indeed superior.

Eleanor was speechless.

I say one thing.

You have ten responses waiting.

Hehe...

Consider this matter over.

...

Victoria had been in a bad mood these past few days.

Caleb's criticism.

Made her lose face by association.

The Dean and Party Secretary summoned her for a talk.

Not a vice-dean like Blake Cunningham.

The head of the School of Life Sciences.

He admonished her, explicitly and implicitly.

No academic factionalism.

No forming cliques.

Victoria left the Dean's office.

Her back soaked in cold sweat.

The angrier she thought about it, the more furious she became.

She stormed into Blake Cunningham's office to confront him.

Was it you who reported me?

Blake was baffled.

Why would I be stupid enough to go to the Dean?

What good would that do me?

I'd rather keep it buried.

To avoid being accused of poor management.

Victoria paused, frowning.

Then who did it?

A figure surfaced in Blake's mind.

Sebastian Evans could only throw his weight around in front of him.

He absolutely couldn't reach the Dean.

Someone who could get the Dean to do a favor.

And happily too.

It could only be that person.
###Chapter 216

Alexander Laurent Did It on Purpose

Sophia pressed him. "Who did you think of?"

Blake Cunningham gave a cold laugh. "Stop asking. You can't afford to mess with them."

Sebastian Evans would still be indirect.

That person barged right in and demanded answers.

That was the status of an academic titan.

MIT could lose a businessman's funding.

It could never afford to lose a scientist.

"Go back." Blake sneered. "You're nowhere near as good as Eleanor Watson!"

Eleanor Watson was lying in a hospital bed.

Yet she could still get two major figures to step in.

What was Sophia Sullivan, anyway?

…

Sophia returned to her office.

Blake's words echoed in her ears.

Nowhere near as good…

Far behind…

She was so angry she wanted to smash a cup.

But the cup was already shattered.

Only a pen holder remained on her desk.

Crash!

The pen holder hit the wall.

Pens scattered everywhere.

Ashley Lowell pushed the door open.

She didn't sense the tense atmosphere. "Auntie."

She walked into the breakroom to pour a drink.

She drank as she spoke. "So thirsty… When will Caleb's paper be done? The professor asked today. I said within the week. Can you hurry him?"

Sophia's face was expressionless. "Is a research paper cabbage? Within the week? Do you even think before you boast?"

Ashley was stunned. "Auntie…"

"Shut up! Address me as Professor Lowell!"

"There's no one else here…"

"Walls have ears! One wrong word, and we're both finished!"

Ashley was frightened. "Sorry, Professor Lowell! I'll be careful next time! The paper…"

"You still want the paper? Write it yourself! Sophia Sullivan can buy equipment. Can't you write one paper?"

"Caleb writes one or two for you. Can he write for you forever? Once he soars high, will he still care about you?"

"I can't write it…" Ashley pouted, close to tears.

She had boasted too much. Her persona was set. There was no turning back.

Sophia snapped. "Why cry? I'm not dead! If Sophia Sullivan and her team can do it, why can't you? Your mind isn't on academics at all!"

"You want to be the best at everything. Yet you're worse than everyone. How did I end up with a useless niece like you?!"

"Get—out—!"

Ashley walked out of the office in a daze.

She didn't understand what she had done wrong.

Her aunt had suddenly become fiercer than a demon.

After her outburst, Sophia felt slightly better.

Knock knock knock—

"Come in."

Caleb Watson entered. "Professor, the project progress…"

Sophia reached out.

She took the file and skimmed it.

Her frown deepened. "It's been a month. Why no progress?"

"The microbial culture data is inconsistent. We're troubleshooting. Progress is slow."

"How much longer?"

"…Unpredictable."

"Unpredictable? People find solutions! This project has been stalled for over half a year. No paper by year-end means zero output for the team in the second half!"

Caleb replied calmly. "Experiments can't be rushed. They require time for verification."

Sophia smiled. "Caleb, you're smart. You know how precious time is. Eleanor Watson's project had no output for two or three years. She was eliminated in the end!"

"You say the data is inconsistent. You want to reculture and verify. You want consistent results? If consistency is inevitable, why waste time verifying? Is it meaningful?"

"Anyway—" Sophia narrowed her eyes. "Consistent or not, we decide."

Caleb looked at her intently. "What do you mean?"

"Adjust the data. Make it consistent. No need for verification."

Caleb was shocked.

"This is academic fraud!" He enunciated each word.

Sophia's face changed. "Caleb, you're sensible. You know what should be said. The advisor only provides ideas. How to execute is your decision."

Caleb looked up. For the first time, he gazed sharply at Sophia.

"Professor, this isn't right."

This isn't right…

…

After Caleb left, Sophia sneered.

It didn't matter if he didn't understand now.

People always grew up.

Then he would realize truth didn't matter.

What mattered was how many SCI papers were published. How many results were produced.

Everyone said research was pure.

Sophia scoffed at that.

Where there were people, there was politics.

Resources, funding, status, professional titles… Which wasn't tied to output?

Only those who reached the summit could talk about "purity."

But first, you had to reach the summit.

Sophia took out her phone. "Send Amelia Roscente in."

It was time for her to be useful.

"Amelia, it's been a month since school started. Settling in okay? Are your seniors treating you well? No one bullying you?"

Amelia was flattered. "No, no. The seniors are all very nice."

"Good. I called you here to discuss a lab matter."

Amelia's eyes lit up. "Can I start working in the lab now?"

"You were recruited by me. There's a place for you in the research group. There's just a small problem… requiring your effort."

"What is it? Please tell me. I'll do my absolute best!"

Sophia smiled kindly. "I heard Eleanor Watson's group next door bought a new CPRT Dynamometer with their own funds. Our group's funding is limited. Do you think you could… lend a hand?"

"Your contribution won't be in vain. I'll remember it. Future high-priority projects, exchange opportunities… they'll go to you, our great benefactor, first!"

"If you want direct admission to the Ph.D. program, as long as your grades are passable, it's no problem."

She dangled the carrot. Whether Amelia could actually get it, who knew?

Amelia had worked hard to get into grad school. She wasn't here to mess around. She wanted to achieve something.

Her mother valued academic qualifications obsessively. If she could get a doctorate, Victoria Roscente would be pleased.

She agreed without a second thought.

A million wasn't much anyway. When she went home, and she'd get it.

Within two days, Sophia's lab also acquired a new CPRT Dynamometer.

The price though…

Amelia almost cried.

Wasn't it supposed to be just over a million?

It cost over two million!

Her family only gave her half. She had to sell over a dozen bags to scrape together the other million.

Those bags were her beloved treasures. Gone, just like that!

Sophia was cheerful all day. She looked for chances to flaunt it in front of Eleanor Watson.

See, it's not just your student who has financial backing.

She circled around a few times but didn't see any sign of Eleanor Watson.

"Professor Watson hasn't been around lately. She was invited to Sydney for the International Bio-Science Summit. Professor Lowell, didn't you receive an invitation?"

"…" Some people really shouldn't talk.

Sophia, unwilling to give up, loitered outside lab C116.

The door was tightly shut. Unusually low-key.

On the other side of the wall, Sophia Sullivan's trio officially began their research.

…

Time in the lab flew by. A week passed in the blink of an eye.

Sophia Sullivan headed home after class.

As she opened her door, she glanced at the neighboring apartment out of the corner of her eye.

She suddenly realized—

Apart from that time in the cafeteria, she hadn't run into Alexander Laurent for a very long time, both before and after.

Logically, they lived across from each other.

Before, even though Alexander was busy, they'd occasionally meet in the hallway.

But this time…

No matter if she left early in the morning or came home late at night, the door opposite was always tightly shut.

She had a faint feeling—Alexander Laurent was doing it on purpose.

He was avoiding her.
###Chapter 217
Let It Go

Sophia Sullivan felt something was off these past few days.

Alexander Laurent seemed to be avoiding her.

He used to go for night runs every week.

Once, she heard noise in the hallway and opened her door.

She only caught a glimpse of his back as he closed his own door.

He would take a day or two off each month.

But recently, his door had remained shut.

The strangest incident was that one time.

She had just opened her door.

The gap in his door across the hall moved slightly.

Hearing her, it immediately closed shut.

Sophia stood frozen.

She couldn't understand it.

When had she offended him?

She couldn't even ask him since he was never around.

What was it about her that made him avoid her like this?

Right now, Alexander was standing by his window.

He listened to the sound of her footsteps fading away.

He watched until he saw her figure exit the residential complex.

Only then did he withdraw his gaze.

His expression was complex.

It wasn't that he wanted to hide.

He had no choice.

The first time he had that dream, he could still call it an accident.

But after seeing her in the cafeteria, he dreamed of her again that night.

It was even more outrageous than the first time.

In the dream, he was like a beast out of control.

Ignoring her pleas, he pinned her beneath him.

Reckless and relentless, without any fatigue.

After waking up, every detail replayed in his mind.

He ripped off the sheets and duvet cover in frustration.

He threw them all into the washing machine.

He didn't understand why he was having such dreams.

How could he defile her like that?

Yes, defile.

This self-loathing made it impossible for him to face Sophia.

If he saw her and those images resurfaced.

How could he face himself?

These past few days, Sylvia Laurent had brought over meals a few more times.

After returning home, she quietly said to her husband, "Our son is in a bad mood. He only asked for one portion of food. He might be heartbroken."

Frederick Laurent remained silent.

...

The research project was progressing smoothly.

The relationship between Sophia and her two colleagues grew more harmonious.

At noon that day, they went off-campus for lunch.

On their way back, they discussed their plans for the afternoon.

Hannah Morse suddenly stopped walking.

Sophia and Marcus Lawrence stopped with her.

Marcus asked, "What's wrong?"

Hannah motioned with her chin toward the school gate. "The ex-boyfriend is here again."

She looked at Sophia with sympathy.

Sophia's mouth twitched.

Was it too late to hide now?

It was too late.

Ethan Roscente had already seen her.

He was holding a bouquet of champagne roses, striding toward her.

Hannah cleared her throat lightly. "Marcus, I'm thirsty. Let's go buy some water?"

Marcus glanced at Sophia, then nodded. "Okay."

The two quickly left.

Sophia didn't even want to maintain surface peace. "Ethan, don't you have anything better to do?"

He was taken aback. "Sophia..."

"We broke up a year ago. Stop looking for me."

The man frowned and shoved the flowers into her arms. "No."

Sophia was exhausted. "How many times do I have to say it? You have so many options. Why keep pestering me?"

"Because you're the only one I want."

She gave a wry smile. "That's not what you said when you had your arm around Isabella Langley at Charlie Lowell's birthday party."

'Isabella is a good girl.'

'I want to make it official with her.'

His past words were like a slap to his face now.

His eyes reddened. "I was blind back then. I mistook a fake for the real thing. I know my apology is late, but you've always been the one I love most."

"Sophia, please forgive me?"

"It was right here that you agreed to be my girlfriend. Give me another chance. Let me win you back?"

Sophia handed the flowers back to him. "No."

"If you feel even a shred of remorse for me, stop showing up at the school gate."

"Your presence makes me the subject of gossip. It causes me trouble."

Ethan's displays of affection were always on his own terms.

She used to think it was candid and passionate.

Six wasted years made her see the truth.

It wasn't love. It was selfishness.

Selfishly using his own methods, ignoring her situation.

Sophia hated being talked about.

But he always flamboyantly delivered flowers.

He parked his car in the most conspicuous spot at the school entrance.

He came to her classroom, claiming he was there to accompany her to class.

He never knew how much gossip and ridicule she endured behind her back.

"...You never told me this... I didn't know..." Ethan murmured, dazed.

"Did you really not know?" Sophia's gaze was sharp. "Or would you have continued even if you did know?"

Ethan was speechless.

"Six years is a long time, but you never understood me, just like I never understood you. So, this relationship... let it go. There's no need to pick it back up."

After speaking, Sophia walked past him and left.

Ethan's face turned pale.

He took half a step back and collapsed onto a bench.

Not far away, behind a tree, two shadowy figures were watching intently.
###Chapter 218

Deborah Melville and Tyson Richter followed Ethan Roscente to this secluded private club.

They hid behind a tree, not daring to peek out.

The distance was too great.

They couldn't see anything clearly.

Deborah scratched her head anxiously.

She wished a telescope would magically appear in her hands.

But one thing was certain.

There was a woman with Ethan.

She was tall.

And had an outstanding presence.

No wonder he abandoned her daughter so quickly.

For the past month.

Deborah and Tyson had been treated like royalty by the Roscente family.

Victoria Roscente granted their every wish.

Their days were carefree and joyful.

They were so comfortable they became completely lost.

They never wanted to return to their previous life of poverty.

Once they got the money.

Mother and son would be set for life.

Seeing that Victoria was already exhausted from their demands.

They felt the timing was right.

They decided to take the money and leave.

But when Deborah named the astronomical price of 7.2 million dollars.

Victoria was completely stunned.

She stood frozen for a full minute.

After confirming it wasn't a joke.

Victoria immediately turned hostile.

She threw out a single sentence.

Seven point two million?

In your dreams!

Then she turned and walked away.

After that.

Victoria stopped answering Deborah's calls.

All financial support was cut off.

Including their hotel accommodation.

All contact was completely severed.

Only then did the mother and son realize.

They might have gone too far.

Mom.

How about we ask for 720,000 dollars instead?

After struggling internally for a while.

Deborah gritted her teeth.

Fine.

720,000 it is!

But Victoria simply wouldn't answer her calls.

She had completely given up on them.

The corporate shareholder meeting was already over.

There was no longer any need to indulge this greedy pair.

Seeing Victoria's firm stance.

Deborah and Tyson turned their attention to Ethan.

But he had bodyguards whenever he entered or left the company.

After the last incident.

The building's security became even stricter.

They couldn't get inside at all.

The mother and son could only resort to staking out and following him.

After a few days of waiting.

She actually managed to catch him!

And even accidentally discovered the other woman's existence!

Just as she was about to move closer.

To get a better look at the woman's face.

Her phone suddenly rang.

She quickly retreated behind the tree trunk.

She answered the call impatiently.

Hello?!

Mom.

Where are you and Tyson?

Why haven't you visited me for so long?

I'm all alone in the hospital.

Aren't you worried about me at all?

After Deborah and Tyson moved out of the hospital room.

They never went back to see Isabella Langley.

She hadn't been very cooperative.

Always making a scene all day.

Crying and sobbing.

Her condition kept fluctuating because of it.

So even after more than a month.

She still hadn't been discharged.

A nurse nearby saw her getting agitated again.

She quickly took the phone.

Are you Isabella Langley's family?

The patient's emotions are very unstable right now.

You need to come to the hospital immediately!

Deborah didn't want to go.

After getting used to luxury hotels.

The smell of disinfectant at the hospital made her nauseous.

But then she thought.

To get money from the Roscente family.

Isabella was the key.

They couldn't afford to mess things up at this critical juncture.

So she agreed.

My sister is staying in such an expensive hospital.

Eating and drinking the best.

Yet she still causes trouble every day.

Why is she so fussy?

Tyson couldn't help but complain.

Some people just don't know how good they have it.

In one word.

Dramatic!

Right?

Your sister is so unreasonable.

Who are we running around for?!

She doesn't appreciate it.

And even adds to the trouble...

At the hospital.

Isabella almost cried when she saw her mother and brother.

Mom.

Tyson.

Why did it take you so long to come?

I was afraid you had forgotten about me...

Deborah pointed a finger.

And poked Isabella's head hard.

Frustrated by her lack of ambition.

Cry cry cry.

All you know how to do is cry!

Your brother and I are doing this for you.

We've been negotiating with the Roscente family all this time.

Trying to get Ethan to make things official with you.

Who are we working so hard for?

Yet you keep causing trouble.

Why did I give birth to such a brainless daughter?

Isabella rubbed her forehead.

Her lips pursed.

You never tell me anything.

How was I supposed to know.

She felt wronged but also a little hopeful.

You said you want Ethan to make things official with me?

What did he say?

The baby was gone now.

The 72 million dollars had vanished into thin air.

Using the child to get money was no longer possible.

But if she could marry into the Roscente family.

Become a wealthy socialite.

Would she ever have to worry about money again?

During this month in the hospital.

Isabella often thought about the past when her stomach was still flat.

And the baby was safe and sound.

She used to run to the hospital.

Argue with Ethan every day.

And fight with Victoria...

Relying on her good health.

She recklessly caused trouble.

While making others miserable.

She was also destroying herself.

She drank cold beverages.

Ate cooling fruits...

The deeper she thought.

The more she wanted to slap herself.

If only she had known...

If only she had known...

The baby would really be lost.

She should have just rested peacefully during the pregnancy.

Whatever anger she had.

Couldn't she have waited until after giving birth to express it?

Deborah frowned.

What could he say?

Ethan isn't an easy man to talk to.

It's hard to even get a meeting with him.

Tyson was also getting annoyed.

Victoria was already willing to give them money.

Wouldn't it be better to just take 720,000 dollars and leave?

Why did she have to say 7.2 million?

Not a penny less...

Tyson's gaze at Deborah held a trace of unconscious blame.

But he didn't voice any of it.

Mom.

What should we do now?

Deborah's eyes turned fierce.

Those with nothing to lose fear nothing.

If he doesn't agree, we'll just go make a scene again.

Let's see who gets scared in the end!

The next day, mother and son went to Ethan's company again.

The main entrance was strictly guarded.

They couldn't get in.

Fortunately.

Tyson found the building's fire escape.

Behind a hidden small door.

A poster was pasted on the door.

Blending in with the surrounding wallpaper.

At first glance.

It was hard to tell it was a door.

Through this door.

They could access any floor of the building.

But what crushed the mother and son was.

There was no elevator!

They had to climb the stairs floor by floor!

Mom...

Should we think of another way?

Tyson swallowed hard.

Twenty or thirty floors.

His legs would break.

Deborah.

What are you afraid of?

We're climbing!

Once we get up there, it's 720,000 dollars.

Are you still complaining about being tired?

Tyson instantly perked up.

Money.

He was coming!

Fifty minutes later.

The mother and son finally reached Ethan's floor.

Deborah took out a wrench she had prepared beforehand.

She directly broke open the fire escape door on that floor.

Not giving the secretaries, assistants, or security any time to react.

She started shouting at the top of her lungs.

Ethan Roscente, you bastard.

If you don't give us an explanation today.

I won't go on living!

Everyone, come judge for yourselves.

This Ethan Roscente got my daughter pregnant and refuses to take responsibility.

My daughter is still lying in the hospital!

Our family has no money and no connections.

Aren't you driving us to our deaths?

If you refuse to take responsibility.

I'll jump from here right now.

I won't let any of you off even as a ghost!

Deborah's voice was very loud.

But unfortunately.

The soundproofing between floors was excellent.

So.

Apart from their current floor.

No other floor could hear what she was screaming.

And this floor only had Ethan's assistants.

Or his secretaries.

Who would dare spread a single word?

But Deborah didn't know that.

She was still shouting desperately.

Screaming desperately.

The assistants and secretaries looked at her with indescribable expressions.

Until.

Deborah sat on the windowsill.

Preparing to jump.

Only then did they take it seriously.

She could die.

But she couldn't die here.

Fortunately, Ethan came out of his office in time.

He looked expressionlessly at Deborah, who was already sitting on the windowsill.

And at Tyson, who was pretending to劝 her not to jump.

Finished causing a scene?

Don't you want money?

Come in and talk.

After speaking.

Regardless of the mother and son's reaction.

He turned and walked back inside.
###Chapter 219

Mother and son exchanged a look.

They were finally getting to the money.

Deborah quickly climbed down from the window.

The window was pitifully narrow.

It couldn't possibly fit an adult.

Her previous actions were all an act.

Just to force Ethan Roscente to show himself.

She had succeeded.

But Deborah didn't notice.

The assistant was looking at them with a hidden meaning in his eyes.

Deep within that gaze.

There was actually a trace of pity.

...

The pair stepped back into the office.

It was still just as luxurious.

Deborah got straight to the point.

"Five million."

Ethan raised an eyebrow. "Not fifty million?"

Deborah cursed inwardly.

She certainly wanted that.

But the other party wouldn't give it.

These rich people were so stingy.

They could spend millions on fun.

But refused to give a little more in charity.

She had seen through it.

The wealthy only cared about value.

Victoria Roscente was initially meek and submissive.

After turning hostile, she wouldn't even answer calls.

Making a scene and acting unreasonably was useless.

Deborah laid her cards on the table.

"You and Isabella were in a consensual relationship."

"But you hurt her."

"Compensation is only right."

"The amount is negotiable."

Ethan gave a light laugh. "You've gotten smarter."

"Five million. Yes or no?"

"If yes, take the money and leave."

"And never bother me again."

Ethan said calmly, "I already gave Isabella three million."

"Now it's only two million."

"What?! You gave her three million?!"

Deborah nearly jumped up.

Tyson Richter's eyes also widened.

Isabella hadn't mentioned a single word.

Both were lost in their own thoughts.

Ethan said bluntly, "Leave the account number."

"It will be there before noon."

Deborah breathed a sigh of relief. "Fine."

"Remember your words."

"Don't show up again."

"Otherwise—"

Deborah's mind was full of the money.

She assured him repeatedly, "Don't worry!"

"I'll disappear once I get the money!"

Tyson swallowed hard.

Five million.

He had never seen that much money.

First, buy a nice car.

Let everyone know he had made it.

Ethan raised his hand. "See them out."

The assistant pushed the door open.

"This way, please—"

The mother and son floated out of the building.

Five million was a lot.

They couldn't earn that in ten lifetimes.

They were about to head back to the hotel.

A truck approached.

Its speed was normal at first.

The pair didn't pay it any mind.

Cars yield to pedestrians.

But the truck suddenly accelerated.

It slammed into them.

"Mom—"

Tyson was terrified.

Deborah yanked her son aside.

"How are you driving?!"

"Are you blind?!"

"You almost killed someone!"

"Pay up! You have to pay!"

Deborah planted her hands on her hips and shouted.

"This isn't over!"

"We need to go to the hospital for a check-up!"

"Compensation for emotional distress is a must!"

Tyson fell to the ground, rolling around.

"I was scared to death!"

"My head isn't clear!"

"Everything went black!"

Mother and son worked in perfect sync.

It was clear they did this often.

The baseball-capped driver smirked.

He floored the accelerator.

Deborah's shouts cut off abruptly.

Tyson's pupils contracted violently.

...

Before the floor-to-ceiling window.

The man looked down at the street scene.

The traffic flowed like a woven ribbon.

Ethan checked his watch.

Half an hour had passed.

There should be a result.

Two minutes later.

His phone rang.

He answered without speaking.

A hoarse male voice came from the other end.

"It's done."

Ethan's expression didn't change.

"Dead?"

"Too many cameras in the downtown area."

"Hard to hit them a second time."

Ethan's voice was icy.

"Answer me."

"Dead or alive?"

"Not dead."

As expected.

Ethan laughed.

But his voice was cold.

"Incompetent?"

"Sorry."

"Commission halved."

"Fine."

The call ended.

Ethan put away his phone.

He stared coldly out the window.

His gaze was stern and murderous.

At the same time.

The truck driver took off his baseball cap.

He let out a long breath.

Ethan wanted to buy a life for a million.

He wasn't stupid.

Going to jail for that amount of money.

Injure, don't kill.

Half the commission was still five hundred thousand.

No risk involved.

The driver whistled triumphantly.

This deal was worth it.

He hoped it happened more often.

Smiling, he picked up his phone.

He dialed a number.

"Hey, you guessed right."

"Ethan Roscente wanted a hit."

"The info is yours."

"How do you want to pay?"

"Don't worry, you'll get it."

A payment notification arrived seconds later.

Fifty thousand.

Fifty thousand for one piece of information.

"Generous as always, Mr. Evans."
###Chapter 220

Only a cold warning came through the phone.

"Watch your mouth. Don't say anything you shouldn't. Otherwise, I won't mind shutting you up for good."

The call ended abruptly.

The driver held his phone, his back soaked in cold sweat.

...

The night grew deeper.

Ethan stood before the floor-to-ceiling window, a statue frozen in place.

The sunset had completely vanished.

Darkness swallowed the sky.

Shadows spread silently from the corners.

The glass reflected the man's tall, straight silhouette.

He suddenly picked up his phone and dialed a number.

The other party answered quickly.

Ethan's voice was low. "Having fun, Sebastian?"

There was a pause on the other end. "Ethan, what nonsense are you spouting now?"

The corner of his mouth lifted slightly. "Has Lee Waters contacted you?"

Lee Waters. The driver's name.

Silence fell on the other end of the line.

Ethan continued. "Then he should have told you. The person is still alive."

Sebastian said nothing.

"What a pity. Lee Waters was too afraid of prison to finish the job. So it doesn't count as me hiring a hitman. All your scheming was for nothing."

Sebastian's eyes turned cold. "...When did you figure it out?"

"Heh. We've been brothers for so many years. You know me. What made you think I wouldn't know you?"

Victoria Roscente had clearly cut off Deborah Melville and her son's funds and kicked them out of the hotel.

Yet they were still living comfortably.

They moved to a five-star hotel.

They came to the company every day to lie in wait.

Without someone backing them, how could they have lasted this long?

Sebastian let out a light laugh. "I underestimated you."

"Why?" Ethan's veins bulged. He spoke each word clearly. "Why set me up like this?"

After all their years as brothers, he actually wanted to send him to prison!

If Lee Waters had actually killed someone, Ethan would definitely have been arrested.

To reduce his sentence, he would naturally have named the mastermind.

Incitement to murder.

Two lives.

With the media fanning the flames.

What a catchy headline: "Heir Apparent Treats Human Life as Dirt."

It would easily ignite public outrage.

Public opinion would ultimately influence the trial, leading to a heavier sentence.

With this combination of blows, even if Ethan had sky-reaching abilities, he wouldn't have escaped.

"Sebastian, you're ruthless."

"Heh... Didn't you calculate it all perfectly?"

He had calculated that Lee Waters wouldn't dare to kill.

He had also calculated that Sebastian was pulling the strings behind the scenes.

Ethan gritted his teeth. "I considered you a brother. Why? Because of Sophia Sullivan?"

"Hahaha... Brother?" Sebastian suddenly laughed wildly. "I'd rather have never fucking met you!"

Ethan sneered, hitting the nail on the head. "Yes, we were brothers. So Sophia Sullivan could never accept you."

Sebastian's laughter stopped abruptly.

"You thought sending me away would change that? In Sophia's heart, you're just her ex-boyfriend's brother. Even a rabbit doesn't eat the grass near its own burrow. Besides, she's so strong-willed."

"Shut up!"

"What? Touched a nerve? Hahaha... Sebastian, you have today coming! You deserve it!"

With Sebastian's caution, the setup shouldn't have been so sloppy.

When he first noticed something was wrong, Ethan hadn't suspected him at all.

There were too many loopholes.

The flaws were too obvious.

Sebastian was so smart. How could he?

But Ethan had forgotten.

Even the calmest person can make mistakes.

Even the most rational person can panic.

"I never thought you'd scheme against me to this extent for Sophia Sullivan."

He never imagined that Sophia Sullivan held such importance in his heart.

Important enough for him to take such a huge risk.

"Scheme?" Sebastian chuckled lightly. "Not really. I just went with the flow. Made things convenient for them."

As Ethan had said, the plan was full of holes.

If he had designed it himself, even if it didn't kill Ethan, it would have skinned him alive.

"If you can't even avoid a trap like this, then you wouldn't be wronged eating prison food."

A deal with no loss. Why not do it?

If it succeeded, it would send him directly to prison.

Or lock him firmly with Isabella Langley.

If it failed, it would still cause him trouble.

"Despicable!" Ethan ground his teeth. "For a woman, you'd fucking set me up like this?"

Sebastian sighed softly. "She's not just any woman..."

She was Sophia Sullivan!

Ethan sneered. "Stop playing the devoted lover in front of me."

But Sebastian said, "You simply don't understand..."

"Oh, really?" Ethan scoffed. "Don't understand your selfishness? Or your scheming?"

"Sebastian, don't make yourself out to be so noble. If you really liked her, why did you just watch all those six years we were together?"

He watched as Sophia Sullivan suffered all kinds of grievances.

He watched her heart break with sadness and despair.

"Don't talk about how you don't poach on your friend's territory. Someone like you has no heart. How could you be bound by morality? Let me tell you the answer—you did it on purpose!"

Ethan had never been so clear-headed. "You intentionally watched me hurt and torment her. Only then would she leave me. And only then would you have a chance."

"You coldly watched her struggle in pain. Transform in despair. Finally become the woman who captivated your heart. What is that if not selfish?"

If you love someone, you can't bear to see them get hurt.

But what did Sebastian do?

He was like a cold spectator.

He allowed, even facilitated, all of it.

"Your chance was built on her pain. You didn't stop it. You condoned my harm towards her. How are you any different from me?"

"Adding this scheme using Deborah Melville and her son... Sebastian, what do you think Sophia Sullivan would think if she saw your true face?"

The breathing on the other end hitched.

These past days, Ethan had never felt so exhilarated. "She's simple and pure. She hates scheming. She detests cunning. And you just happen to be that type of person."

"Admit it. Sophia Sullivan will never love you. She could only ever like someone like Alexander Laurent. A clean, upright man."

He used to be like that too.

But now, neither of them were worthy!

"Bullshit! You're out of the game, don't drag me down with you! In this lifetime, whether Sophia Sullivan ends up with me or not is one thing. But she definitely won't get back together with you. You can be completely sure of that!"

This was the first time Ethan had seen Sebastian lose his composure.

He was panicking.

And Ethan laughed.

So he wasn't the only one who liked to deceive himself.

Since neither was willing to let go, then...

Let the deception continue.

Let the mistake go all the way.

Ethan spoke. "Don't worry, I won't tell her..."

Not only that, he would actively keep it secret.

Because—

Losing when hope is greatest is the most despairing.

Isn't it?
###Chapter 221

Li Xiaolian and Shi Yanfeng were not killed by the truck.

But they were left half-dead.

They were covered in blood, with broken foreheads and scraped cheeks.

When the truck charged, Shi Yanfeng was still rolling on the ground throwing a tantrum.

By the time he realized what was happening, the wheels were right in front of him.

His limbs went weak, his courage shattered. He didn't even have the strength to get up.

He could only watch as the truck closed in.

"Mom—"

He screamed hoarsely.

He thought he was done for, but the truck swerved at the last second.

It brushed past the hem of his clothes.

Shi Yanfeng stood frozen.

When he came to his senses, he realized his pants were soaked.

The swerving truck headed straight for Li Xiaolian.

Li Xiaolian covered her head and ran, but the truck chased her like a cat playing with a mouse.

It wouldn't kill her, but it wouldn't let her go either.

It was just toying with her, teasing her.

Li Xiaolian ran, hid, and screamed like a madwoman.

She was utterly exhausted, but her survival instinct kept her going.

Until...

She ran headfirst into a tree trunk. Her face was covered in blood as she collapsed.

Only then did the driver stop and drive away.

"Mom... Mom, are you okay?" Shi Yanfeng scrambled over on his hands and knees.

Li Xiaolian lay motionless, blood gushing from the wound on her forehead.

Shi Yanfeng tried to cover it with his hand, forgetting it was covered in urine.

"Mom! Wake up!"

He called out countless times before Li Xiaolian finally opened her eyes.

"What happened to me?" Her eyes were dazed.

Suddenly remembering, her face turned deathly pale. She trembled all over.

Her teeth chattered.

As if she was still trapped in that immense terror.

"Let's go..." She gripped Shi Yanfeng's hand tightly, her nails digging into his flesh. "Let's go! Get out of here now!"

"...Why?"

"Wait for that person to come back and run us over?!"

Shi Yanfeng also recalled the earlier danger and hurriedly helped Li Xiaolian up.

Mother and son scrambled away from the scene.

They rushed to the hospital where Isabella Langley was and got their wounds treated.

"Mom, I... I'm so scared..."

"We can't stay here anymore. Ethan Roscente is too ruthless!" He actually wanted their lives!

Li Xiaolian finally realized the wealthy were not to be trifled with.

Shi Yanfeng: "Should we call the police?!"

"The driver is long gone, and it was a blind spot for cameras. Would the police even care?"

Besides, calling the police would expose their extortion attempt.

"But Ethan Roscente hasn't given us the money yet!"

Li Xiaolian gritted her teeth: "He wants us dead. Why would he give us money? He was deliberately stalling!"

"Then all this was for nothing?"

Li Xiaolian's eyes darted: "Not exactly without gain..."

Shi Yanfeng was stunned.

...

In the hospital room, Isabella Langley waited for her mother and brother, but it wasn't what she expected.

"Ethan Roscente gave you three million. Hand it over." Li Xiaolian stood by the bed, arms crossed, gauze wrapped around her head.

Isabella Langley was shocked: "Mom, how are you hurt?"

"It's all because of you! If it weren't for you, why would we have provoked Ethan Roscente?"

With no benefits left, Li Xiaolian couldn't be bothered to play the loving mother.

Shi Yanfeng: "Ethan Roscente is so vicious. You didn't warn us? Did you want us dead so you could keep the three million for yourself?"

Isabella Langley hurriedly defended herself: "I didn't! Why would I harm you? I didn't know he was this ruthless either!"

Li Xiaolian sneered: "You were with him for so long, and you didn't know what he's like?"

Shi Yanfeng: "Exactly! I'm badly injured. The medical bills are high. Ethan Roscente isn't paying, so you have to compensate us!"

"Don't pretend to be poor. Ethan Roscente said he gave you three million!"

Thinking of this, Li Xiaolian was furious. She had money but hid it, letting them take the risks while she reaped the rewards.

Isabella Langley's eyes darted, lips pressed tight: "I have no money now. I can only give you twenty thousand..."

"Bullshit! I know your tricks! Where's the card? Where did you hide it?"

Li Xiaolian knew her daughter too well. She must have secretly kept the money!

Ignoring Isabella Langley's cries, she searched everywhere.

Isabella Langley tried to get out of bed to stop her but was held back by Shi Yanfeng.

"Stay put! Mom and I worked for you, almost got run over. Taking some money is only right!"

Li Xiaolian rummaged through the drawers and finally found the bank card in the backpack.

"Fengfeng! Come quick!"

Shi Yanfeng's eyes lit up.

"That's my money! Give it back!" Isabella Langley desperately tried to get out of bed. That card held all her savings.

Originally three million, she had spent some, leaving just over a million.

If taken, she would truly have nothing left!

Shi Yanfeng shoved her hard: "You were hiding money after all. I never thought you were so scheming!"

Li Xiaolian: "Fengfeng, no more talk. She's my daughter. I can take her money if I want. Let's go home!"

If it weren't for Isabella Langley, they wouldn't have so much trouble. If she had money, why not say so earlier, making them run around for nothing.

"Mom, Fengfeng—you can't do this—that's my money—"

She chased after them, her eyes full of despair: "...Take the money, but don't leave me... Mom..."

Li Xiaolian didn't look back.

Isabella Langley collapsed in the corridor, wailing.

At that moment, she felt abandoned by the whole world.

...

Learning that Li Xiaolian had taken Shi Yanfeng and left Kyoto, taking all of Isabella Langley's money, Ethan Roscente smiled with satisfaction.

He called the hospital: "Freeze the account. Suspend all expenditures."

"What about Miss Langley's hospitalization fees..."

"Did you not understand? Freeze and suspend. What happens to her is for the hospital to handle according to regulations."

That afternoon—

"Miss Langley, you have recovered. You may be discharged."

"I'm not leaving. I'm waiting for him." Isabella Langley sat on the bed, eyes vacant, like a soulless puppet.

"If you wish to continue staying, please go to the first floor to pay. Here is the bill..."
###Chapter 222

You Deserve It

Isabella's pupils trembled as she paid the bill.

"Isn't it automatically deducted from the account?"

"The account is frozen."

"Frozen? Why?"

"The holder requested it."

Requested it himself.

Isabella suddenly laughed.

"Ethan Roscente, you're ruthless."

After over a month in the hospital.

She was finally discharged.

The sunlight was blinding.

White clouds drifted.

It felt like a lifetime had passed.

...

Ethan left work early.

He got into the car.

"Back to the mansion."

"Yes."

He closed his eyes to rest.

The sound of wind whistled past his ears.

When he opened his eyes, it was completely dark.

Dark clouds loomed overhead.

A storm was brewing.

He hated the rainy season.

Damp, stuffy, and suffocating.

The car entered the Beverly Hills estate.

Screech—

It came to an abrupt halt.

Ethan's body jerked forward, then was pulled back by the seatbelt.

"What happened?" he asked coldly.

The driver hurriedly apologized. "Someone suddenly rushed out..."

Ethan looked up.

A light drizzle was falling.

A woman stood in front of the car.

Soaked through.

Her white dress clung to her body.

Outlining her slender figure.

Water droplets dotted her pale face.

Like a pear blossom about to fall in the rain.

The driver felt a pang of pity.

Ethan indifferently looked away.

"Since when are the security so incompetent? Call someone to remove her."

The driver immediately made the call.

Isabella had nowhere to go.

Her mother and brother had abandoned her.

She couldn't return to school.

Only this mansion remained.

But...

She looked through the car window at the man's cold profile.

He wouldn't even grant her a glance.

Isabella threw herself at the rear window, pounding desperately.

"Ethan... I'm back... Don't ignore me..."

"You're all I have left..."

"I know I was wrong... I'll listen to you from now on..."

The window remained firmly shut.

The property manager arrived with security.

"No trespassing on private property! Please leave!"

Isabella explained urgently. "I'm the owner! I live here!"

The security guard was expressionless. "Don't recognize you."

"I'm Ethan Roscente's girlfriend! He can confirm it!" She banged on the window. "Ethan... Please don't send me away..."

Two security guards simply lifted her and dragged her away.

Ethan watched coldly.

"Drive."

The driver broke into a cold sweat. "Yes..."

Isabella was thrown out of the gated community.

"Should've taken the easy way out! Get lost!"

The guards cursed as they left.

...

The rain stopped.

Isabella wandered aimlessly.

She found herself at the gates of Caltech.

Students laughed and chatted.

Full of youthful energy.

She used to be one of them.

Suddenly.

She saw a familiar figure.

"Madison—"

She rushed over and grabbed the other's wrist.

Like clutching a lifeline.

Madison Klein was startled.

Her companion politely excused herself. "We'll meet you at the shop."

"Okay."

Madison turned to look at Isabella.

Her expression was complicated.

"How did you..."

A month ago at the hospital.

Isabella was in a patient gown enjoying expensive tonics.

Now she was drenched and disheveled.

"Madison..." Tears welled in Isabella's eyes. "The baby's gone... He doesn't want me anymore..."

Madison wasn't surprised.

She just didn't expect it to happen so fast.

Isabella held onto her tightly. "Let me come back to the dorm..."

"You withdrew... Your bed was assigned to someone else..."

"Help me... I have nowhere to go..."

Madison hesitated.

"Maybe... lend me some money? I'll pay you back!"

Madison hesitated, then took out her phone.

"I can transfer you six hundred..."

"Six hundred?" Isabella was stunned. "How is that enough? A single piece of my clothing costs more than that! Ask your parents for money!"

Madison froze.

Her eyes turned cold instantly.

The last trace of sympathy vanished.

"Isabella, you're still not facing reality."

"Sorry, I won't give you a single cent."

"Because you—"

"Deserve it."

You brought this on yourself.

You refuse to see the truth.

Madison turned and walked away.

"Madison! Madison Klein! You're just jealous of me!" Isabella screamed. "Give me the money!"

The night was deep.

Isabella drifted through the streets.

Hungry and cold.

She passed a nightclub.

A side door was open next to the opulent main entrance.

Men and women came and went frequently.

The men were bloated and greasy.

The women wore revealing clothes.

But they carried designer bags.

And wore expensive fashions.

Isabella's eyes burned with envy.

Once, she had been that glamorous too...

"Hey, been staring long enough? Here for the job?"
###Chapter 223

Isabella Langley's voice was hoarse.
"Do you have any food?"

The woman chuckled softly.
Her gaze swept over Isabella.
"Follow me."

Isabella looked up at the neon-lit sign.
The Gilded Cage.

She knew what stepping inside meant.

But hunger and exhaustion had stripped away her reason.

So had her craving for luxury.

She finally followed the woman through the door.

She had to survive.

Only by living could she get revenge on Ethan Roscente and Sophia Sullivan.

…

Reality quickly dealt Isabella a heavy blow.

The money wasn't easy to earn.

Her beauty got her hired on the spot.

The Gilded Cage provided free room and board.

That night, she finally slept well.

The next evening.

She changed into a revealing miniskirt.

A floor manager led her to a private room.

The door closed.

The soundproofing was excellent.

Not a single sound escaped.

The door opened again.

Isabella staggered out.

Her dress was torn.

Her high heels were gone.

She was down to her underwear.

Red marks covered her body.
Some were still oozing blood.

Her eyes were swollen from crying.
Her voice was gone from screaming.

She clutched fifty thousand dollars in cash.

Two hours.
Fifty thousand dollars.

The corner of her mouth twitched.
She thought she was smiling.

Her heart felt like a gaping hole.
A cold wind whistled through it.

Isabella lasted three days.

Twenty thousand dollars for her battered body.

She asked to quit.

The manager snorted with laughter.
"Quit? You think The Gilded Cage is a grocery store?"
"Making thousands a day isn't good enough for you?"

Isabella insisted on leaving.
Twenty thousand was enough to start over.

The manager's smile vanished.
"Pay the penalty for breach of contract."
"Penalty?"
"It's clearly written in the contract. Five million for leaving before a year is up."

Isabella grabbed the contract.
She found the clause in the fine print.
"This is fraud! The contract is void!"

She turned to leave.

Two large men blocked her path.
"What are you doing?"

The manager smirked.
"Teaching you the rules."
"You think you can make money and just run?"

Ten minutes later.
"Manager, she's passed out."

The men stopped.

The manager frowned.
"Throw her in the storage room. No food or water."
"Yes."

After everyone left, the manager made a call.
"Mr. Lombardi, it's done as you instructed."

A cold voice came from the other end.
"Keep her locked up until she's compliant."
"Understood."

…

Isabella was locked up for three days.
She only got 50ml of water each day.

Hunger and thirst drove her insane.

She thought back to a month ago.
She was living in a luxury mansion.
Servants attended to her.
She drank bird's nest soup like water.

Now, an extra sip of water was a luxury.

"Help me…"

Only darkness answered.

Her fingers found a shard of glass in the corner.
She pressed it hard against her wrist.

A blood vessel ruptured.
Blood gushed out.

She smiled.

The door suddenly swung open.
Bright light flooded in.

"Shit! She slit her wrist!" the manager cursed.
He turned to the man leading the group. "My apologies, Mr. Lombardi. I failed in my duty."

"Stop the bleeding," the man said calmly. "She won't die."

The bleeding was stopped.

The manager threw a cup of ice-cold beer on her.

Isabella woke up.

The man used the tip of his shoe to lift her chin.
"If you really wanted to die, you should have cut your throat."

Isabella shuddered.
"It's… it's you?"

She grabbed the man's trousers.

The manager moved to step forward.

Daniel Anderson waved him away.

He crouched down to her eye level.
"Recognize me now?"
"Why didn't you answer my calls? Why didn't you help me?"

The man's smile didn't change.
"I'm not obligated to help you forever."
"The game is over. How could I help?"

His eyes swept over her wrist.
"You have the courage to die, but not to get revenge?"

Revenge?

She hated Sophia Sullivan.
But she hated Ethan Roscente even more.

Daniel Anderson spoke.
"I can help you. Like I did in the Maldives."
"Why? What's your motive?"

The man stood up.
"You don't need to know."
"We share a common enemy."

Isabella's breath hitched.
"What should I do next?"

The man's gaze turned icy.
He picked up the glass shard.
Slashed it across her cheek.

Blood poured out.

Isabella covered her face and screamed.

"Lesson one—break before you rebuild."

Early the next morning.
A private jet took off from Kyoto for Country H.
Home to the world's most advanced plastic surgery.

Isabella lay on the plane.
Her face was bandaged.
Her eyes were empty.

She would be back.
She swore it.

…

Eight in the morning.
Sophia Sullivan arrived at the classroom ten minutes early.

Hannah Morse rushed in right on time.
She held a siu mai in her hand.
A hidden soy milk was in her bag.

"Morning, Sophia! Siu mai from Granny Moore's. Super tasty. Want one?"

Hannah Morse was a top-tier foodie.
In two months, she'd found all the best food spots nearby.
The siu mai in her hand was from the most popular breakfast place.
Diced shiitake mushrooms and chicken breast.
Expensive but worth it.
She'd waited in a long line to get it.

Sophia shook her head.
"I already ate. You enjoy."
"Then I'll dig in…" Hannah mumbled while eating. "Professor Harrison is on an exchange abroad. A substitute will take over."
"The system says it's pending. Please don't let it be Victoria Lowell!"

Sophia replied.
"It probably won't be."

The class bell rang.

A tall figure walked up to the podium.
"Hello everyone, I'll be taking over for Professor Harrison this semester."
"My name is Alexander Laurent."
###Chapter 224

The classroom filled with sharp intakes of breath.

"Is that Alexander Laurent? From the School of Physics?"

"Who else could it be?"

"Oh my god... He's our substitute teacher?"

"He's so handsome..."

Whispers spread through the room.

Hannah Morse's eyes widened.

She poked Sophia Sullivan beside her.

"Sophia, isn't that the handsome guy from the cafeteria entrance?"

Sophia nodded gently.

"Didn't you see him during your interview?"

Hannah shook her head blankly.

"I had my interview in the afternoon. Only Professor Lowell was there."

A thought flickered in Sophia's eyes.

She remembered Amelia Roscente also had an afternoon interview.

Professor Victoria Lowell's team had recently acquired expensive new lab equipment.

So that was it.

On the podium, Alexander Laurent wore a light gray shirt.

His gold-rimmed glasses softened his features.

He looked scholarly, elegant, and exceptionally distinguished.

A student suddenly raised their hand.

"Professor, may I ask a question?"

Alexander nodded.

"I heard you're from the School of Physics. Can you teach bioinformatics?"

A slight smile touched Alexander's lips.

"I initially studied at the School of Life Sciences before transferring to Physics."

"The administration conducts professional assessments before assigning substitutes."

"Please rest assured."

Light laughter rippled through the classroom.

Alexander continued.

"At the graduate level, developing a research mindset is crucial."

"This way of thinking is transferable across disciplines."

Another hand went up.

"Professor, are you single?"

Alexander adjusted his glasses.

"Too many questions. Let's begin the lecture."

"Today's topic is the application of big data in bioinformatics..."

The class dismissal bell rang.

Alexander closed his textbook.

"Class dismissed."

He picked up his teaching materials and left the classroom.

Hannah clicked her tongue in admiration.

"He left so decisively."

Sophia grabbed her backpack.

"Hannah, I'm heading out."

She hurried out of the teaching building.

On the tree-lined path, she intercepted Alexander.

Surprise flickered in the man's eyes.

Sophia caught her breath.

"Professor Laurent, do you have a problem with me?"

Alexander's fingers twitched slightly.

He hadn't expected her to follow him.

He certainly hadn't expected this question.

"...No."

"Then why are you avoiding me?"

Alexander averted his gaze.

His Adam's apple bobbed slightly.

"...I'm not avoiding you."

Sophia studied him.

"What happened?"

The tips of Alexander's ears turned pink.

Unbidden, those dreams resurfaced.

The young woman stood right before him.

Within reach.

He snapped back to reality.

A wave of self-reproach washed over him.

"Professor?" Sophia called.

Alexander looked up.

He met her clear, direct gaze.

His discomfort intensified.

"...What is it?"

"Are you feeling unwell?" Sophia asked with concern. "Your face is very red."

Alexander cleared his throat softly.

"The weather is quite warm."

Sophia looked skeptical.

She spoke earnestly.

"I don't like guessing games."

"If you have an issue with me, please tell me directly."

Alexander murmured his agreement.

Sophia smiled.

"Shall we go to the cafeteria together?"

Alexander relaxed slightly.

"Alright."

...

In the cafeteria.

Hannah's jaw dropped.

A grain of rice fell onto the table.

Marcus Lawrence frowned.

"Mind your manners."

Hannah pointed into the distance.

"Look over there."

Marcus turned to look.

Sophia and Alexander sat opposite each other.

They ate and talked.

The atmosphere was harmonious.

Marcus looked away.

"Nothing special to see."

Hannah blinked.

"Is Professor Laurent handsome?"

"Handsome."

"Is Sophia beautiful?"

"Beautiful."

"Do they look good together?"

Marcus was speechless.

"Can't even eating shut you up?"

Hannah snorted lightly.

After the meal, Alexander needed to go to the lab.

He said goodbye to Sophia at the cafeteria entrance.

He walked a few steps, then turned back.

Sophia looked up, puzzled.
###Chapter 225

Alexander Laurent gave a light cough.

"Professor Evans wants you to visit the lab when you have time."

Sophia Sullivan looked up. "When did Professor Evans say that?"

"A week ago."

"So you waited until now to tell me?"

Alexander turned and walked away.

Sophia watched his hurried retreating figure and couldn't help but smile.

The sunlight was perfect.

The breeze was gentle.

She decided to do a deep cleaning of her apartment that afternoon.

Her recent coursework had been heavy, and a thin layer of dust had accumulated.

Taking advantage of the clear weather, she would wash what needed washing and air out what needed airing.

Then she would cook herself a lavish dinner.

Just the thought lifted her spirits.

But that good mood vanished completely when she reached the school gate.

Ethan Roscente stood there holding an enormous bouquet.

His tailored suit looked completely out of place on campus.

The blue roses glittered with an expensive sheen under the sun.

Passing students turned to stare.

"It's him again!"

"He switched to blue roses this time. So romantic…"

"If someone pursued me like that, I'd have said yes ages ago."

Sophia frowned deeply.

She had made herself perfectly clear.

She thought he had given up long ago.

Yet here he was again.

So annoying.

She withdrew her foot from stepping outside the gate and turned toward the library.

The deep cleaning could wait for another day.

Right now, she just wanted to avoid that man.

Ethan waited for an hour.

Finally, he smiled bitterly.

The blue roses in his hand seemed to mock his futile efforts.

He walked toward a trash can.

"Such beautiful flowers. Isn't it a waste to throw them away?"

Fiona Valentine stood nearby, smiling.

Her long hair and white dress gave her a gentle, moving appearance.

Ethan looked up coldly.

"What's it to you?"

Fiona's smile stiffened.

She had dressed up specially today.

Most guys would give her a second look.

But this man remained completely indifferent.

It only piqued her interest more.

"Feeling it's a waste has nothing to do with you either."

Ethan scoffed.

He threw the flowers into the trash can right in front of her.

"If you like them, you can fish them out."

He turned and left.

Fiona stared at his retreating back, then at the flowers in the trash, rooted to the spot.

...

The monthly research symposium was held at the end of the month.

Twenty-six research groups took turns presenting their academic progress.

Professor Eleanor Watson was still abroad, so Sophia's group had no advisor present.

They were scheduled right after Professor Victoria Lowell's group.

Caleb Watson stood to report on their group's progress this month.

When he mentioned Ashley Lowell publishing an SCI paper as first author, he paused briefly.

Applause echoed through the conference hall.

Ashley stood up gracefully.

"Thank you to my advisor, Professor Lowell."

Victoria Lowell smiled and nodded in acknowledgment.

Jude Granger whispered in awe.

"Ashley published an SCI? But she's always out having fun."

He nudged Caleb.

"Caleb, did you submit your paper?"

"I'm not submitting it."

"Why not?"

"There were issues with the data. I have to start over completely."

Jude fell silent.

Shane Holloway spoke up loudly.

"Next group, hurry up! Don't waste time!"

He looked directly at Sophia.

Sophia stood up.

"Last month we applied for lab access, purchased our own dynamometer, finalized our research direction. We are currently progressing as planned."

Shane snorted dismissively.

"That's all? Well, I guess without any results, that's all you can say."

Ashley chuckled lightly.

"Shane, give them some face."

"I'm just stating facts."

Sophia sat back down in silence.

Hannah Morse clenched her fists.

Marcus Lawrence paled.

Suddenly, the Vice President answered his phone.

Five minutes later.

He put down the phone, his gaze intense as he looked toward Sophia.
###Chapter 226

All eyes focused on the scene.

The presenting student stopped his explanation.

Everyone was watching the Vice President's unusual behavior.

Another Vice President beside him coughed heavily.

He was trying to remind him to be mindful of the occasion.

But this Vice President directly picked up the microphone.

He took several deep breaths to barely calm his emotions.

"I just received official news."

"A student from the School of Life Sciences has published a Compass in 'Science' as the first author!"

The room instantly erupted with gasps.

"Did I hear that right? 'Science'?"

"From our school? Who is that impressive?"

"It must be Caleb!"

"Who else could it be?"

Everyone looked at Caleb Watson.

Professor Victoria Lowell instinctively raised her chin.

He was her most outstanding student.

But she forgot Caleb had no plans to publish in 'Science' this year.

Ashley Lowell bit her lip and glared at Caleb.

She had only managed a regular SCI paper.

Yet he had secretly published in a top journal.

Fiona Valentine and Amelia Roscente's eyes showed envy.

Jude Granger excitedly nudged Caleb.

"Bro! It's you, right?"

Caleb was about to speak.

Shane Holloway suddenly stood up and started clapping.

"Congratulations, Ca—"

"Let's congratulate Sophia Sullivan!" President Howard Truman announced loudly.

The room fell dead silent.

Shane's hands froze mid-air.

"It's not Caleb?"

"Who is Sophia Sullivan?"

"A first-year grad student? Professor Eleanor Watson's student?"

"I've never even heard of her before…"

Hannah Morse whipped her head around to look at Sophia.

"Sophia? Is that you?"

Marcus Lawrence's mouth twitched.

"Who else could it be?"

Sophia snapped out of her daze.

"There shouldn't be anyone else with the same name."

Hannah jumped up excitedly.

"My classmate is a big shot!"

Marcus looked at Sophia.

"When did you submit the paper?"

"Before the semester started."

President Howard Truman applauded enthusiastically on stage.

"Please come up and share your experience, Sophia Sullivan!"

Thunderous applause filled the room.

Caleb also joined in clapping.

Jude looked at him, confused.

"Bro, aren't you disappointed?"

Caleb gave a faint smile.

"Research shouldn't be about one person dominating."

Ashley's expression shifted uncertainly.

Professor Victoria Lowell's smile completely vanished.

Sophia was pushed onto the stage.

She picked up the microphone.

"Academia is a long process."

"Research is inherently challenging."

"Stay true to your初心, and you will eventually succeed."

After saying this, she bowed in thanks.

Her gaze swept over Professor Victoria Lowell's team.

Professor Victoria Lowell's expression was stiff.

A flicker of guilt showed in her eyes.

Caleb's gaze was deep and thoughtful.

Ashley suddenly stood up.

"President Howard, I have a question."

"The semester has been going for less than two months."

"How could Sophia Sullivan possibly publish in 'Science'?"

"This doesn't make sense."

"Unless she cheated!"
###Chapter 227

Her words silenced the entire hall.

Sophia Sullivan, however, smiled.

She looked directly at Ashley Lowell. "What kind of cheating are you referring to?"

Ashley raised an eyebrow. "Such as paying off connections, or hiring a ghostwriter."

Hannah Morse immediately ran to the front row and grabbed a microphone.

She hurried back and handed it to Sophia.

Go get her, Sophia!

It's time for a showdown!

Sophia tested the microphone.

It was loud enough.

"Ashley, you overestimate me. I don't have the money to bribe the editorial board of 'Science', nor the connections to make a senior researcher break the rules for me."

"As for a ghostwriter, I have no idea what could possibly motivate someone capable of writing for 'Science' to be my ghost."

"You seem quite familiar with these underhanded tactics. Perhaps you could teach me?"

Ashley instantly bristled. "What nonsense are you talking about! When did I ever hire a ghostwriter! Do you have any proof!"

Sophia looked puzzled. "I didn't say you hired a ghostwriter. Why are you so quick to defend yourself? Feeling guilty?"

Ashley was immediately speechless.

Her face flushed bright red.

Sophia's lips curved faintly. "You demand evidence from me. Then please present your evidence as well."

Ashley had nothing to say.

She could only sit back down awkwardly.

Sophia's gaze deepened.

Shane Holloway wanted to speak.

But seeing the microphone in Sophia's hand.

He chose to remain silent.

Professor Victoria Lowell suddenly looked towards the leadership on stage.

"President Truman, does this paper have a corresponding author?"

Sophia was the first author.

Who was the corresponding author?

President Truman nodded. "Yes."

Victoria pressed further. "Who?"

Everyone assumed it was Professor Eleanor Watson.

President Truman: "Professor Alexander Laurent."

The hall erupted in murmurs.

So Alexander Laurent was involved.

No wonder Sophia could produce such a high-quality paper.

The corresponding author is the overall project leader.

The first author is the primary executor.

With Alexander involved, everything made sense.

Including the timeline and the level of expertise.

But why was Alexander willing to be the corresponding author?

Considering his relationship with Eleanor Watson.

It seemed perfectly reasonable.

Victoria had just started to relax.

Hearing Alexander's name made her tense up again.

Wasn't this still because of Eleanor's connections?

She felt her face burn with humiliation.

...

The monthly symposium ended.

People gradually left the auditorium.

Shane and his group slipped away quickly.

They hunched over and scurried along the wall.

It was utterly humiliating.

Being publicly shamed in front of the entire faculty and student body.

Hannah's eyes sparkled. "Sophia, you were so cool!"

Marcus Lawrence lifted his chin. "Let's see who dares to look down on our group now."

Hannah giggled. "Next time I see Shane, I'll look down on him with my nostrils!"

Just thinking about it felt satisfying.

Even better than collecting rent.

"Sophia, can we have more of these showdowns?"

Marcus rolled his eyes. "Do you think this is a game?"

"I want to hit you!"

He was such an old man who didn't know how to play along!

...

Amelia Roscente returned home in a daze.

Victoria Roscente was holding a bowl of bird's nest soup.

She almost spilled it.

"Amelia, why are you so distracted? We have a meeting with Luo Jun tomorrow afternoon at The French Laundry."

"He's a top graduate from Stanford, published a ton of SCI papers, just missing 'Nature' and 'Science'..."

Amelia suddenly spoke. "Sophia Sullivan published in 'Science'."

Victoria froze. "What science?"

"'Science'. The one Luo Jun hasn't published in yet."

Victoria was completely stunned.

...

Early morning.

Sophia prepared to go to the cafeteria for breakfast.

Opening the door, she ran into Alexander Laurent.

They were both surprised for a moment.

Sophia smiled. "Good morning, Professor."

"Morning. Heading to school?"

"Yes, to the cafeteria first."

"Together?"

"Okay."

They walked downstairs.

Alexander turned his head. "The school sent out a congratulatory notice. Congratulations on your successful publication in 'Science'."

"Thank you, Professor. Without your lab and your status as corresponding author, my manuscript might not have been accepted."

Alexander was a regular contributor to 'Science'.

There was always some goodwill there.

"I only provided the opportunity. The ability was yours."

The morning sun shone on both of them.

Quiet and beautiful.

Since their last conversation.

He no longer avoided Sophia.

As for whether those dreams still occurred.

Only Alexander and the sheets drying on the balcony knew.
###Chapter 228

This summer is unbearably hot.

Weekdays are manageable.
The classrooms, labs, and libraries all have air conditioning.

Weekends are even better.
The AC and chilled watermelon at home are perfect.

Sophia Sullivan curled up in her cool room.
She ate ice-cold watermelon while reading a research paper.
It was pure bliss.

Olivia Lopez called.
"It's Saturday. No classes. Really not coming out?"

Sophia sank deeper into the couch.
"Liv, please. I'd melt in this heat."

"New clothes while shopping? Not tempting?"
Sophia took a bite of watermelon.
"Isn't online shopping just as good?"

"You need to test skincare at the counter, right?"
Sophia replied, "I stick to my usual brand. No need."

Olivia's voice became frantic.
"You have to go out for groceries and fruit at least!"

Sophia whispered, "Grocery delivery arrives in thirty minutes..."

Olivia was speechless.

Sophia suddenly realized.
"Are you just really bored lately?"

Olivia sighed deeply.
Her best friend knew her too well.

Sophia found it strange.
"What about all those Kevins, Tonys, and Alexes in your contacts?"

The old Olivia would never suggest summer shopping, even if bored.
She hated the sun more than Sophia did.

This was definitely unusual.
Something was wrong.

"Don't even mention them..." Olivia's voice was full of despair.

Just thinking about it made her furious.

That bastard Julian Winston tricked her into giving him her phone passcode.
Then he used her phone to visit porn sites!

Her phone got a virus.
The whole system crashed.

He promised he could fix it.

Olivia believed him and went for a spa treatment.

When she returned, she was horrified.

Julian didn't fix the system.
He broke the SIM card too.

All her chat history was gone.
Her entire contact list was wiped clean.
Even a new SIM card couldn't recover it!

"Sorry, I thought I could fix it, but the virus was too strong... I'll buy you a new phone, okay?"

Okay? Hell no!

Olivia wanted to punch him and throw the phone in his face.

But she was still at the Winston family estate.
His mother had just gifted her an auction-grade jade bracelet and treated her to a spa day.

It's hard to bite the hand that feeds you.

Olivia had to grit her teeth and bear it.

Julian kept apologizing beside her.
"Liv, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to make it worse. I should've taken it to a professional repair shop..."

Olivia snapped, "Shut up."

Every word made her want to hit him more.

Julian continued, "It's all my fault. I was wrong. I won't do it again. I'll buy you a new phone tomorrow."

Olivia said through clenched teeth, "I said stop talking."

"No, I have to apologize. Ten new phones can't replace your chat history and contacts..."

Olivia's fists clenched.

Julian added, "You can't contact any of those puppy-dog boys now, can you?"

"..."

"What a shame."

Olivia scoffed.
"A broken phone gets replaced. A lost SIM gets reissued. The number's the same. I can still contact them."

They always contacted her first anyway.
Olivia rarely initiated contact.

If she wanted, she could find new ones anytime.

Julian's expression changed.

Olivia snatched her broken phone.
"Touch my things again, and I'll chop your hands off!"

She stormed out.
She had already called a ride-share. She didn't need anyone to drive her.

Julian chased after her.
"Your number is unlucky. So many eights. Let me get you a new one full of sixes? A premium number?"

Olivia rolled her eyes.
"Eights are unlucky? Are you insane?"

"Seven means 'rise', eight means 'fall'. Haven't you heard of the eighteenth level of hell?"
Olivia yelled, "Get lost! Stop annoying me!"

She started the car, shifted gears, and sped off.

Leaving Julian stomping his feet in frustration.

"You're so ungrateful! I never give my premium numbers to outsiders!"

But Olivia couldn't hear him.
Even if she did, she'd only have two words for him: Yeah, right.

On the second-floor balcony, Penelope Winston and the housekeeper watched the scene below.

Nanny Omelas hesitated.
"Miss Lopez seems to be ignoring the young master..."

"Good," Penelope said, arms crossed. Fresh from her treatment, she glowed.
"All men are like that. The easier it is, the less they appreciate it."

"They think women should throw themselves at them. You have to play hard to get. Then they try harder."

Penelope turned with a smile.
"Nanny Omelas, know what this is called?"

"...What?"

"Being a jerk."

Nanny Omelas almost choked.
"Madam, how can you say that about your own son..."

"I'm stating facts. Not just my son. His father is the same."

"I think Liv is great... Reminds me of my younger self!"

Nanny Omelas: "..." Should I be hearing this?

...

Olivia ranted for ten solid minutes.
She called Julian an idiot countless times.

Sophia spoke quietly.
"Do you think he did it on purpose?"

"On purpose?" Olivia paused.
"Purposely broke my phone?"

Sophia said, "Yes."

"Why? What does he gain?"

"...You really don't get it?"

Olivia was confused.
"Get what?"

"...Never mind. Actually, I'm not sure either..."

She didn't understand how a dating expert could suddenly be so clueless.
Had the queen of the sea finally capsized?
Or was the fox just clueless about love?

Olivia confirmed again.
"Really not coming out today?"

Sophia said, "Sorry~"

"Fine. I'll post on my socials and see who's free..."

"Remember to block Julian— Hello? Liv?"

The call had already ended.
She didn't know if Olivia heard that last reminder.
###Chapter 229

Olivia Lopez was completely unaware.

She picked up her new phone and snapped a casual picture of the bar counter.

The focus was on an upside-down wine glass.

The background blurred into soft, hazy light spots.

Caption: Lazy afternoon. Endless summer.

She tapped send.

The phone was tossed carelessly onto the sofa.

She walked barefoot into the bedroom.

Her steps were light and swaying.

A nap first.

The air-conditioned room was truly comfortable.

No wonder Sophia hated going out…

She didn't feel like moving now either.

…

Julian Winston had an indoor surfing lesson booked today.

The coach was top-tier, his schedule hard to book.

He hadn't really wanted to go out.

But thinking of how difficult the booking was, he went anyway.

After a few rounds of coaching, he improved rapidly.

Julian felt he could conquer every wave.

He sat down to rest and casually opened his social feed.

Olivia's post popped up.

"Lazy afternoon. Endless summer…"

The picture was of a wine glass.

It seemed like an ordinary post.

The words carried a careless laziness.

An ordinary person scrolling past would just smile and move on.

But Julian was different.

A seasoned player in the game of love, his instincts were sharp.

Lazy afternoon—

Keyword: Lazy.

Subtext: I'm bored and need company.

Endless summer—

Keyword: Endless.

Subtext: I have all the time in the world, waiting for you to spend it.

The wine glass hinted at alcohol.

Alcohol could lower inhibitions, and enhance the mood.

Every word from this woman was sending a signal.

Julian understood instantly.

"Olivia Lopez—Very good—"

He grabbed his robe, put it on, and strode towards the showers.

The coach called out from a distance, "Mr. Winston, not continuing?"

"Something urgent came up!"

"So sudden?"

"Extremely urgent!"

He was going to catch someone right now.

…

Olivia slept until three in the afternoon.

She stretched and walked out of the bedroom.

Completely relaxed.

She picked up her phone from the sofa.

Wanted to see who had understood the hint.

Quite a few, as expected.

A: [Bored too. Drinks?]

B: [You free, sis? I'm available anytime]

C: [On my way]

D: [Is the code still the same?]

…

The corner of Olivia's lips lifted.

This should stave off the boredom.

But she waited and waited.

The earliest comment was from two hours ago.

Still, no one was at the door.

What was going on?

She waited another ten minutes.

Poured herself a glass of ice water during that time.

The doorbell remained silent.

She walked to the foyer, pushed the door open to check if the bell was working.

A figure suddenly sprang up.

"Ah—" Her hand jerked, the glass almost falling. "Julian, are you insane?!"

What normal person squats outside someone's door?

Jumping up the moment the door opened, like a ghost!

Julian stared at her intently.

His gaze was dark.

Olivia felt a chill under his stare.

"What are you—"

"When did you change the code?"

Last time he came, it still worked. This time, it was wrong.

Olivia was baffled. "I changed it after you left last time."

"Why?"

"Seriously? I'm a woman living alone. I can't just let anyone know the code, right? Then anyone could just walk in. Do I look that stupid?"

The internet was full of tips for women living alone on how to protect themselves.

Changing the code was basic.

Julian: "You do this with everyone?"

"Of course not. I always tell my mom and Sophia whenever I change it. I don't change it after they've visited. Why are you asking?"

"Why did you change it just because I knew?"

Olivia looked exasperated. "Who are you to me? Why wouldn't I change it? Are we that close?"

Julian: "...Other men know the code…"

"I change it immediately." Was that even a question?

Julian didn't know whether to be happy or worried.

Happy that this woman still had some boundaries. Play around, but at least know to be cautious.

Worried that he was no different from other men to her. She was wary of him too.

Olivia: "Did you need something?"

Julian glanced inside. "It's too hot outside."

"So?"

"Can we talk inside?"

Olivia stepped aside to let him in.

The man grinned as he entered, changed his shoes with practiced ease, walked straight to the living room, and collapsed onto the sofa.

As if he was right at home.

Olivia rolled her eyes. "Spit it out. I'm busy."

Julian smirked. "Busy with what? Busy arranging to kill time during this endless summer? Or to share this lazy afternoon?"

"Holy crap—" Olivia's eyes widened. "Why are you bringing up my post?"

And reading it out loud? So embarrassing!

Julian: "You weren't afraid of people seeing it when you posted it. What's wrong with me reading it? Only allowed to post, not to be read?"

"You came all the way here in the afternoon just to read my post? That bored?"

"Yep, I'm bored, here to answer your call. Where's the wine glass? Shall we clink glasses?"

Olivia's eyes darted away. "What call… You're insane…"

"Tch. Weren't you rounding up players in your post? I'm here."

"…"

She forgot this guy was a player too. No wonder he got it.

Julian's lips curved. "How do you want to play? Living room or bedroom?"

Hearing his sarcastic tone, Olivia couldn't help but frown. "I do want to play, but not with you."

Julian raised an eyebrow. "Why not?"

"Mixing personal relationships with business complicates things. I never get involved with people connected to my work."

Julian: "Our work doesn't overlap."

Olivia: "We're in a partnership now."

He snapped his fingers. "Partnership, partnership. Doesn't that mean we have to cooperate with each other?"

"Right."

"My mom asked me yesterday if we'd had a fight. She saw you having dinner with another man."

Olivia frowned. "Yesterday… I was at the company all day. I had lunch with a colleague…"

"A man?"

Olivia nodded.

"See! My mom must have misunderstood. To ensure the stability of our partnership, we need to re-establish some ground rules." The man said with a straight face.

Olivia said 'Oh,' and without even asking, directly replied: "Okay, then I refuse. The partnership ends here."

Julian: "?"

Why didn't this woman follow the script?
###Chapter 230
Come to My Place?

"No way... Why call it off? We can talk this through!"

Olivia Lopez scoffed.
"Weren't you just implying the deal was over if I didn't agree?"

"I dislike forcing people.
I despise indecisiveness even more.
You can't just change agreed terms on a whim.
Is this a game to you?"

"I'm very particular.
Unreliable partners should part ways early.
It saves everyone time.
Don't you think?"

Julian Winston sat up straight.
"How am I unreliable?!"

She cut straight to the point.
"So, do you still want to renegotiate the rules?"

"...N-no, not really." His spine instantly went limp again.

What was pride?
How much was it worth?

"Hmph. That's more like it."

He muttered under his breath.
"I came all this way... haven't even eaten..."

"What did you say? Speak up, will you? A grown man mumbling like that."
"Fine! I said I'm hungry!"

Olivia was taken aback.
She thought he was secretly cursing her.

"Can't the great Julian Winston afford a meal?"

He instantly flared up.
"I've been camped outside your damn door for an hour! Where was I supposed to eat? Thin air?"

She pursed her lips.
"I didn't tell you to camp out. Your own foolishness isn't my fault."

Julian: "!" His liver ached. Seriously.

In the end, Olivia made him a cup of instant noodles.

He slurped noisily while complaining.
"Couldn't you offer something better to entertain me?"

She sat at the other end of the sofa, scrolling on her phone without looking up.
"Eat it or leave. Your choice."

Julian: "..."

Fine. He'd eat the noodles.

He even drank every last drop of the broth.

"...Burp!"

Olivia shot him a disgusted sidelong glance.
"You've eaten. When are you leaving?"

He leaned back on the sofa, patting his full stomach contentedly.
"Anything to drink? Iced, preferably."

She raised an eyebrow.
"Really? Treating me like your maid now?"

"Don't get mad. You're so quick to explode. Can't you be a little nicer?"
"No."

"..."

Julian got up and went to open the fridge himself.

Wow. No real food, but plenty of drinks.

He opened a soda and gulped it down.
A satisfied fizzy burp escaped.

Olivia: "Must you make such disgusting sounds?"
"Burp! Burp! Burp!"

He took another sip and burped again.

Olivia: "..."

The desire to murder someone was clear in her eyes.

...

A sweltering summer afternoon.

Laziness permeated the air.
Their bickering filled the entire apartment.

Julian stubbornly refused to leave.

Olivia was utterly exasperated.

She swore to herself she'd block him from her Moments next time!

...

Meanwhile, Sophia Sullivan woke from her nap and read two research papers.

Sitting for too long, she got up to stretch.

She went to the kitchen to prepare a fruit platter.

One downside of summer was that fruit peels attracted mosquitoes easily.

So, after peeling, she tied up the trash bag.
She decided to leave it outside her door temporarily.
She would take it down when she went out later.

As she opened her door, she saw the door across the hall wide open.
Several repairmen were crowded in Alexander Laurent's living room, discussing something.

Alexander emerged from the bedroom.
"Tried it. The bedroom AC isn't cooling either."

One repairman slapped his knee.
"Right! Must be an issue with the external unit then."

Sophia blinked.
"Professor, is your AC broken?"

Alexander's gaze shifted past the repairmen to her.
"You're home?"

"Yes, it's Saturday."

He gave a wry smile, pointing at the AC.
"It broke this morning."

Sweat beaded on his forehead.
His shirt was damp, clinging to his chest and back.

Coming from her air-conditioned room, Sophia felt hot just looking at him.

"The technicians are working on it. Would you... like to come to my place? My AC is on."

Alexander was taken aback.

"Is it convenient?"
###Chapter 231

Sophia nodded. "Of course."

"Thank you."

The door opened, releasing a wave of cool air.

Alexander changed into slippers.

Sophia went to the kitchen to get water.

It was four in the afternoon. She assumed he had already eaten lunch.

But she asked anyway. "Have you eaten, Professor?"

"Yes."

"Would you like some fruit? It's freshly cut."

She returned to the kitchen and brought out a fruit platter.

"Thank you," Alexander said.

Sophia sat down and speared a piece of cantaloupe. "When did the repairman say the AC would be fixed?"

"They need to replace a part. It's being delivered from the shop. It'll take another two or three hours."

"That's soon. You can stay here until it's fixed. This weather is unbearable without AC."

"Thank you. Please, don't let me disturb you. Go about your day."

"Alright." Sophia nodded.

She paused before entering her bedroom.

She turned to look at Alexander.

"Professor, the restroom is over there if you'd like to shower."

She pointed.

Alexander's shirt was soaked through, clinging to his skin.

The cool air made the fabric feel icy.

The contrast between hot and cold was a recipe for illness.

"Ahem—"

Alexander choked, the piece of cantaloupe catching in his throat.

He recovered, waving his hand quickly. "No, that's alright. I'll shower at home."

"Okay. Let me know if you catch a cold. I have some medicine."

"Alright."

Alexander went home.

Sophia went into her bedroom to review her thesis.

Half an hour later, she closed her laptop.

She stretched.

With a guest over the weekend, her fridge was stocked with fresh ingredients.

She should invite him to stay for dinner.

She opened the fridge to check, mentally planning the menu.

The living room was empty. Alexander hadn't returned yet.

Sophia took off her jacket and hung it on the coat rack.

Her bedroom AC was too cold, so she had put on a cardigan.

Now she felt hot again.

She took off her T-shirt, leaving only her camisole.

Putting the jacket back on would be just the right temperature.

But the kitchen was stuffy. Long sleeves were out of the question.

She decided to change back into a T-shirt.

There was a loose T-shirt on the coat rack.

She could hang her jacket up at the same time.

She didn't go back to the bedroom, opting to change right in the living room.

Alexander wasn't back yet…

She was down to her camisole, just picking up the T-shirt.

The restroom door suddenly swung open.

Alexander stepped out.

The door faced the coat rack directly.

They came face to face.

The man held a change of clothes, his hair dripping wet.

It soaked through the T-shirt he was wearing.

His neck and cheeks were damp, indistinguishable between water and sweat.

Seeing Sophia, his mind went blank—

Completely short-circuited.

The girl wore a black camisole. The tight fabric accentuated her full curves.

The camisole was a bit short, revealing a sliver of her waist.

Her small navel was clearly visible.

Slender arms, distinct collarbones.

Her skin, contrasted against the black, was dazzlingly pale.

Exactly like the her from his dreams…

Sophia froze in place.

The T-shirt in her hand forgotten.

"P-Professor…"

Alexander spun around abruptly.

He took a deep breath, trying to keep his voice steady.

"I'm sorry for using your restroom."

Only he knew how strained his voice sounded.

His throat was dry, his breath hitched.

Thump—thump—

His heart hammered wildly, threatening to burst from his chest.

Alexander had originally intended to shower at home.

He fetched his clean clothes and headed for the restroom.

A group of repairmen crowded inside.

The old building lacked fixed AC unit placements.

The external unit was mounted on the outer wall.

A repairman, secured with a safety harness, was lowered from the window to work on the exterior wall.

Showering was impossible. Even normal use was difficult.

Alexander had no choice but to go to Sophia's place.

He meant to tell her.

He stopped at her bedroom door.

He was afraid of disturbing her.

Maybe she was sleeping?

He would be quick. Just a few minutes.

He probably wouldn't run into her.

But of all the luck!

Sophia hurriedly pulled on the T-shirt.

She stammered an explanation. "I—I thought you weren't here…"

This was so awkward!

Looking at the man's back, her cheeks burned.

"Professor, I'm decent. You can turn around now."

Alexander turned around.

Their eyes met.

The air was thick with awkwardness and tension.

And a faint, almost imperceptible hint of something else.

Sophia averted her gaze and turned to go into her bedroom.

She leaned against the wardrobe, taking deep breaths.

The flush on her cheeks refused to fade.

The reflection in the mirror showed eyes bright like water, breath slightly ragged…

When she came out again, she held a dry towel.

She handed it to Alexander casually. "Professor, it's clean. For your hair."

"...Oh, okay!" The man reacted a beat slowly, taking the towel.

Sophia pointed to where the hair dryer was. "...It's over there. You can use it."

"...Okay."

With that, she went into the kitchen.

Soon, Alexander followed her in.

His hair was dry, strands falling over his forehead.

It softened his demeanor, making him seem less severe.

"I'll help," he said.
###Chapter 232

Their coordination grew increasingly seamless.

Alexander Laurent was responsible for washing and chopping the vegetables.

Sophia Sullivan handled the stir-frying at the stove.

Soon, four dishes and a soup were laid out on the table.

Alexander filled a bowl with rice and handed it to her.

Sophia took the bowl and thanked him softly.

The atmosphere was natural and harmonious.

It was as if the previous awkwardness had never occurred.

After the meal, Alexander took the initiative to clear the dishes.

Sophia took the plates and dried them.

Their movements were fluid and effortless.

An accident happened while taking out the trash.

They both bent down simultaneously to tie the garbage bag.

Their foreheads collided unexpectedly.

Sophia gasped in pain.

Alexander immediately stepped forward to check.

He gently moved her hand away from her forehead.

The skin was red but not swollen.

It shouldn't be serious.

Alexander apologized repeatedly.

Sophia shook her head and said it was fine.

But her eyes glistened with unshed tears.

The corners of her eyes were slightly red.

She looked like a wronged little animal.

Alexander's eyes were full of guilt.

"Professor, could you let go first?"

Alexander realized he was still holding her wrist.

He released it abruptly and took two steps back.

Sophia couldn't help but laugh.

Alexander raised an eyebrow helplessly.

"Is it that funny?"

The girl nodded repeatedly.

He sighed softly.

"As long as you're happy."

He bent down again to tie the garbage bag securely.

…

The repairman knocked on the door to announce the air conditioner was fixed.

Alexander changed his shoes, preparing to leave.

The repairman joked with a smile.

"It's so convenient for a young couple to live across from each other."

"If one air conditioner breaks, you can just go to the other's place."

Alexander cleared his throat lightly to interrupt.

"Master, let's go test the unit first."

He didn't explain their relationship.

He felt it was unnecessary.

An explanation would only make it more complicated.

They were people who wouldn't see each other again in the future.

Why say more?

The most important thing was that he was currently leaving the girl's apartment.

Explaining they weren't a couple would only invite more gossip.

In scandalous news, women always suffer more.

Society is inherently harsher on women.

The most Alexander could do was protect her from harm.

That was all.

After testing the unit, he saw the repairman out.

The door across the hall suddenly opened.

Sophia peeked out and asked.

"Professor, is it fixed?"

Alexander nodded.

"Are you still going for a run tonight?"

"Together?"

The girl smiled and agreed.

They went back to their respective homes to change into workout clothes.

They met downstairs and began their night run.

The sun set in the west, and dusk deepened.

Moonlight quietly spilled down.

Stars gradually appeared one by one.

On the third lap, Sophia stopped.

"Professor, you go ahead. I need to rest."

Alexander stopped as well.

"Are you okay?"

The girl's temples were damp with sweat, her cheeks flushed.

"It's unbearably hot."

"Then we'll stop. I'll walk with you."

Sophia pressed her lips together sheepishly.

They walked along the tree-lined path.

They passed the main gate of MIT and bought water.

Alexander twisted the cap off a bottle and handed it to her.

"Thank you."

They circled around to the basketball court behind the back gate.

A basketball suddenly flew toward Sophia.

Alexander quickly pulled her behind him.

He caught the ball steadily with one hand.

Whistles came from the court.

"Nice catch, classmate!"

"Want to join a game? We're short one player."

Alexander looked at Sophia.

The girl nodded in agreement.

"Professor, I'll wait for you in the stands."

She suddenly realized something was off.

Why did he ask for her permission to play?

Alexander blocked two shots in a row as soon as he stepped on the court.

Laughter and teasing came from a distance.

"You're a pro, classmate!"

"We'll have to be careful now."

Alexander raised an eyebrow in response.

"Show me what you've got."

His offense was sharp and broke through effortlessly.

He scored precisely with shots both near and far.

His jumping ability was astonishing, allowing for repeated dunks.

Sophia watched excitedly, clapping.

After twenty minutes of high-intensity offense.

Alexander still seemed relaxed and in control.

The opponents finally conceded.

"We give up, we give up."

"Pulling a ringer into the game? We admit defeat."

Teammates gathered around to praise him.

"Which department are you from? You've been hiding your skills!"

"How come we've never seen you before?"

Alexander replied calmly.

"I'm from MIT, but I don't come here often."

Everyone wanted to add him on WeChat.

Suddenly, someone pointed to the stands.

"Is that your girlfriend?"

Alexander looked up.

Sophia was waving and smiling from a distance.
###Chapter 233

"Not yet," Alexander replied.

"Oh~ Got it, got it! Still chasing, right?"

He remained silent.

The guys took his silence as confirmation.

"How long have you known her?"

Alexander thought for a moment. "Over a year."

"This long and you still haven't caught her? Dude, your efficiency is terrible! Wasting that height and those looks!"

Alexander: "..."

"Listen to me, bro. Let me teach you a killer move. Ninety-nine percent of women can't resist it…"

Alexander appeared indifferent on the surface.
But when the other guy reached the crucial part, he unconsciously focused intently.

…

On the way back, Sophia was animated. "...Professor, that shot was incredible... and that move…"

She gestured excitedly as she walked, her face full of expression.
Alexander kept pace beside her, occasionally responding, a faint smile always playing on his lips.

Passing a pharmacy, he suddenly stopped. "Wait for me a moment."

He strode inside.
When he emerged, he held a bottle of medicinal oil.

He pointed to her forehead. "It still looks a bit red. It might bruise tomorrow. This will help it heal faster."

Sophia hadn't expected him to buy medicine specifically for her.

"It's just a small injury. It'll be fine tomorrow. No need for the trouble," she quickly declined.

"A bruise on the face isn't attractive. Don't women care about their appearance?"

"Women?" Sophia raised an eyebrow.

"Yes. Olivia is like that too."

"...Well, thank you then." She reached for the bottle.

But Alexander made no move to hand it over.
Instead, he opened a pack of sterile cotton swabs.

"It's awkward to do it yourself. Let me."

He had specifically washed his hands and used sanitizer at the pharmacy before coming out.

Sophia was slightly taken aback, surprised.

He dipped a swab in the oil.
Gently, he brushed aside the strands of hair on her forehead, revealing the reddened skin.

The moment his fingertips touched her, Sophia felt a distinct heat, different from her own body temperature.
Then the cool swab made contact, and that searing warmth subtly receded.

"Hmm?" Sophia sniffed lightly, her nose twitching. "This oil... it actually smells quite nice..."

Not pungent at all.
It had a strong floral scent.

Alexander gave a low hum of acknowledgment.
He had asked the clerk, who said this one was the most popular.
Especially with women. They all liked it.

"Done." He withdrew his hand, took a half-step back, and discarded the swab.

Sophia felt a cooling sensation on her forehead. It was indeed more comfortable.

"Thank you."

They walked upstairs together and parted at their doors.

Whether he forgot or not, Alexander didn't give her the remaining oil and swabs.
He took them back to his own apartment.

Sophia didn't mind. A small injury like this would be gone after a night's sleep.
Even if he had given her the oil, she probably wouldn't have remembered to use it.

That night, after his shower, Alexander lay in bed.
His classmate's "advice" echoed in his ears—

"First, as men, if we like someone, we should be proactive. Don't just stupidly wait for the woman to make the first move."

"Next, work hard to create opportunities for contact. Feelings develop gradually through more interaction. Ambiance often happens in the unplanned moments spent together. How can you move to the next step if you hardly ever see each other?"

"Then, the most crucial point! During your time together, consciously create some physical contact. Like accidentally kissing, tripping and falling into a kiss, or finding a romantic spot and just pulling her into your arms and kissing her when the moment feels right!"

"Finally, win her over with meticulous care, gentleness, and attentiveness. This includes, but isn't limited to, verbal concern, goodnight texts, gifts on holidays, sharing meals, being there when she needs you!"

"Only then will she see you as reliable, let down her guard, and safely fall into your embrace!"

"Get it?"

Alexander thought it made a lot of sense.

Except for one part.
Tripping into a kiss and just pulling her into your arms to kiss her…
The former seemed too fake and dangerous.
The latter was basically assault.

He didn't believe these were expressions of love.
On the contrary, they showed a lack of respect for women.
Yes, disrespectful!

Yet, in his dream, he did all those "disrespectful" things.
He even inexplicably heard himself ask, "...Sophia, does that feel good?"

Alexander jolted awake, sitting up in bed.
He clutched his head in懊恼, like a child who had done something wrong.

After who knows how long, his emotions finally settled.
He got out of bed, went to the wardrobe, and pulled out a clean pair of boxer briefs to change into…

Hadn't this stopped?
Why was it happening again?

…

Early the next morning, Quincy arrived at the lab.
He'd left before the data finished processing yesterday and came specially to complete it today.

If Alexander found out, he'd never hear the end of it.
So he'd set three alarms, dragged himself out of bed before dawn, and driven straight to the lab.

Only to find—
"Whoa! When did you get here?! Isn't it Sunday?! We agreed on two days off this week! What are you doing here?!"

His reaction was far too intense.
His guilt was obvious at a glance.

Alexander stood by the lab bench, looking up coldly. "So, you didn't finish processing yesterday's data?"

Quincy: "!"

Damn!

"No... I mean, why aren't you enjoying your time off?! Why are you here?! Alex, sometimes I really think you take this too far! You put overachievers to shame!"

Alexander let out a faint "Oh." "I processed two sets of your data for you. I take it you don't need them?"

Quincy froze.
The next second, a wide smile spread across his face. "Heh heh, I was just joking! You took me seriously?... Overachievers are great! So impressive! So amazing! Truly outstanding~"

Alexander: "..."

At noon, Quincy, exhausted, headed to the break room to lie down.
Passing Alexander's slightly ajar door, he overheard him on the phone—

"...Yes, braised pork ribs, sweet style... Two portions... Delivered to the lab before 6 PM... Okay..."

"Oho, who's sending you food?! Your girlfriend?!" Quincy instantly transformed into a gossip enthusiast.

Alexander simply lay down, turning his back to him: refusing to engage, wanting no part of it.

Quincy rubbed his nose and slunk away.

On the other end, Sylvia had just hung up with her son.
She rushed excitedly into the living room, snatched the teacup Frederick was about to sip from, and grabbed his shoulders, shaking him vigorously—

"Two portions! Two portions again! Ahhh— Our Alex has a chance!"

Frederick: "?"

Sylvia: "Do you know what our son said on the phone? He said the ribs should be sweet! Sweet! Why do you think?!"

Frederick: "...Stop shaking me, I'm dizzy…"

Sylvia: "It must be because his girlfriend likes them! I'll have Martha... No, I'll cook them myself! And deliver them personally myself!"

She stormed into the kitchen like a whirlwind.
Turning, her clothes knocked something over. She didn't even glance at it.

Frederick: "!" My Da Hong Pao!!!

Alexander took the food his mother prepared from the lab back to his apartment.
He then picked up the medicinal oil and cotton swabs and went to knock on the neighbor's door.

But—
There was no response for a long time.
###Chapter 234

Sophia was already on the high-speed train back to her hometown.

It was Eleanor Yuan's eightieth birthday.

The three Sullivan brothers had decided to throw a lavish celebration.

All the younger generation, including Sophia, were required to attend.

The festivities would last three days.

It wasn't a holiday, so she had to request time off.

Professor Eleanor Watson was abroad at an academic summit.

Due to the time difference, Sophia sent a Leave email.

The professor was very understanding.

She not only approved the leave but also asked Sophia to convey her birthday wishes.

The train arrived at the station at two in the afternoon.

Isabella Sullivan came to pick her up.

"Where's Dad?" Sophia asked, finding it odd not to see him.

Isabella had a driver's license but disliked driving.

David Sullivan was usually the chauffeur.

But today...

Isabella sighed. "Your father is busy."

"It's Sunday. He doesn't teach."

What could he be busy with?

Isabella let out another sigh.

Sophia grew more curious.

"It's a long story..."

It was a milestone birthday, and the old  woman loved a lively gathering.

Relatives had started arriving two days early.

Accommodating over a dozen people became an issue.

The elderly couple lived with the eldest son, William Sullivan, in his villa.

But the villa wasn't that large, with only four suites.

William occasionally hosted friends at home.

Having a bunch of country relatives move in was... unsuitable.

"Theboss's place is out of the question!" Eleanor declared at the family meeting, her tone as domineering as ever.

Her sharp eyes swept over Charles and David Sullivan.

Since the eldest was unsuitable, the burden naturally fell to the second and third sons.

Victoria Sullivan spoke first. "Mom, my place can fit two people."

"Don't be ridiculous!" Eleanor scoffed. "Your tiny two-bedroom apartment is decorated so delicately. Those relatives would probably wreck it in one night. You might not care, but I do!"

After her divorce, Victoria had embraced a chic, powerful woman aesthetic.

Her home was tastefully furnished.

She likely didn't truly want her rural relatives staying over.

But with Eleanor's decree, as the daughter, she had to show willingness.

She knew the old  woman wouldn't actually let her suffer losses.

With one sentence, Victoria was off the hook.

The pressure shifted to David and Charles Sullivan.

David opened his mouth to speak.

But Charles's wife, Chloe Sullivan Sullivan, smiled and cut in. "Mom's arrangement is considerate, sparing bother and sister. Charles and I want to help, but our circumstances just don't allow it..."

"You see, my parents just gave us their place at Lakeside Pearl to live in. The old couple moved into our previous old apartment. It's move-in ready, but we still have to buy all the furniture and appliances ourselves."

"My parents hinted that since they're helping us out so much at their age, perhaps you, old  woman, could also lend a hand?"

Eleanor's face darkened slightly.

Chloe Sullivan quickly changed tack. "I said absolutely not! You're already relying entirely on brother and his wife. How could you possibly have money to help us?"

Eleanor's expression softened a little.

"So I didn't bring it up to you. No matter how difficult, Charles and I will shoulder the cost of furnishing the place ourselves. But right now, with things still half-empty, having to host relatives and friends... it's just too embarrassing..."

"I have thick skin and don't care about losing face myself. But I'm afraid the relatives will ask why we live in such a nice neighborhood but haven't even bought a washing machine. We can't very well say we're broke, that my parents gave us the house but no spare cash, and that our in-laws didn't help either..."

"After the banquet, the relatives will just leave, and who knows what rumors they'll spread back home. Charles and I don't care; we barely go back anyway. But we're worried about your reputation, Mom."

"Of course, if you think it's fine, then they are welcome to stay. I love a bustling atmosphere!"

Chloe Sullivan finished her rapid-fire speech with a bright smile, waiting for the old  woman's response.

Internally, she was seething—

Their new home, barely moved into, and they were supposed to let country bumpkins stay?

Only a fool would agree!

Eleanor's eyes flickered.

"Since you've just moved and aren't fully set up, forget it. It's my birthday. I can't have guests without access to a washing machine."

"Exactly," Chloe Sullivan sighed, unable to suppress a smirk. "If only our parents could support us a little more, life wouldn't be so tight... Oh, Mom, don't misunderstand. I meant my own parents, not you."

Eleanor: "..." She hadn't been overthinking it, but now she certainly was.

However, the old  woman made no comment on the implied request for "support."

Chloe Sullivan secretly curled her lip. Stingy old woman!

But she had to admit, the old  woman knew how to manipulate people.

At least she had Eleanor figured out.

William Sullivan sat in the host's seat, silent throughout.

He was very busy. If not for the changed schedule, he should have been at the office.

His wife, Sophia Sullivan, tried to smooth things over. "Actually, we could accommodate some people here. Maybe we could arrange—"

Eleanor cut her off with a wave. "I already said, the boss's place is not an option."

Sophia smiled faintly and fell silent.

William stood up. "Enough arguing," he stated directly. "Book several rooms at the banquet hotel. It's convenient and hassle-free for them to stay there."

Chloe Sullivan immediately chimed in. "brother's consideration is so thorough! I think that works!"

"Stay in a hotel?" Eleanor's face fell. "How much will that cost?"

William sighed. "Mom, I'll pay for it. Don't worry about the money."

"No! You already cover日常 expenses for your father and me. You're paying for the banquet too. It's not like we only had you one son! Having relatives come for a celebration and making them stay outside? It's not right!"

Charles's eyes gleamed. "Mom, I don't like hearing that."

William was paying for the banquet, but he was also keeping the money.

He and Chloe Sullivan had colleagues and friends coming too. They'd have to return the favors later. Who was benefiting from whom wasn't clear!

Eleanor insisted, "Anyway, I refuse to have them stay outside! Hosting guests must be done at home to be proper. Otherwise, who knows what they'll say behind our backs back in the village! At my age, I won't live without dignity!"

Chloe Sullivan's eyes darted. "Mom's concern makes sense. I have an idea..."

Everyone turned to look at her.
###Chapter 235

Chloe Sullivan Sullivan beamed as she continued her suggestion.

"Doesn't the third brother and his wife live in that huge mansion? They could easily host all the relatives from back home! Multiple floors, luxurious decor, central air and heating… even sleeping on the floor wouldn't be a hardship!"

"Not just a dozen people, they could fit twice that many! The key point is the back gate of the Lakeside Pearl mansion is so close to the banquet hotel, just a short walk away. They wouldn't even need transportation!"

The more Chloe Sullivan spoke, the more feasible it seemed, and she nodded repeatedly.

She completely ignored that her own home was in the same gated community and equally suitable.

David Sullivan finally found an opportunity to speak.

Several times before, he had tried to interject but either couldn't get a word in or was immediately cut off—

"I originally planned to do just that. Since big brother and second brother aren't in a position to host, Isabella and I discussed it. We'll have all the relatives stay with us."

It was only for three days, after all.

The old lady had made her position clear, and Chloe Sullivan was being slippery. However reluctant Isabella felt, she had to grit her teeth and accept it.

It wasn't that she looked down on country folk. She was currently outlining a new book, had already discussed the synopsis with Stone Macmillan, and was still revising it. She was used to a quiet environment for writing and couldn't help feeling this would be disruptive.

But it wasn't unbearable. Isabella stated, "Mom, don't worry. We will take good care of our relatives and friends."

…

Isabella spoke while driving.

"...The folks from back home are already settled in at the house. Your father is busy hosting and can't get away, so I came to pick you up."

Sophia Sullivan nodded. "Mom, I rarely see you drive. You're pretty good."

She hadn't yet realized the severity of the situation.

Isabella lifted her chin slightly. "Of course! I pick things up quickly!"

…

Lakeside Pearl Mansion.

"David, this house is yours?! My goodness, it's so grand!"

The speaking elder had a face full of wrinkles and graying hair. She looked about the same age as Eleanor Yuan, but by family hierarchy, David had to address her as "Great-Aunt Deborah."

"Oh my! Is this a lamp? Why is it covered in feathers? Plucked from a goose, were they? I have to say, it looks quite unique this way! Where's the switch? Let me turn it on and see... Huh? It's just a regular lamp? I thought the feathers would make it brighter!"

David began to sweat. "No... the feathers are just decoration. They don't do anything..."

"Then why stick a bunch on if they don't do anything?"

"..."

"Ya! There's a vase here... It looks very nice. I remember your grandfather's family also liked displaying calendars and vases, but theirs weren't as pretty as this. It must have cost a bit, right?"

The old lady had lost most of her teeth, and her speech was unclear, but it didn't stop her from touching everything and offering commentary.

"Come here, come here, Wayne, there are snacks here! Weren't you just saying you were hungry? Eat up. Your third cousin lives in such a big house; he surely isn't stingy—" The old lady turned to call her grandson, then smiled at David. "Right, little third son?"

"Yes, yes, make yourself at home. Treat it like your own home."

The old lady usually lived in the countryside. She had come two days early for the banquet and, of course, brought her entire family.

It was all expenses paid, plus a chance to enjoy the city. Only a fool would pass that up!

William Sullivan had been lucky early on, started his own company, made money, and brought his parents to the city to care for them.

Charles Sullivan was also doing well—a secure, respectable job at the power bureau, married the daughter of a leader.

Only David Sullivan was slightly worse off. Heard he graduated from a prestigious university but became a teacher.

It sounded good, but it didn't pay well!

The old lady had muttered more than once: That Eleanor Yuan's sons weren't all born under a lucky star!

But now...

David was actually doing well?!

That Eleanor Yuan really had all the luck...

Great-Aunt Deborah grew more jealous the more she thought about it and just urged her grandson to eat more.

Since they were here, they had to get their money's worth!

Besides Great-Aunt Deborah's family of eight, there was another family, headed by someone addressed as "Auntie Melissa," who had also brought her entire clan.

Auntie Melissa's reaction upon entering was similar to Great-Aunt Deborah's. She looked around in amazement. "David, you've made it big, haven't you?"

"Can teachers earn this much now?" She lowered her voice, probing discreetly. "Is there some... extra income involved here?"

David quickly shook his head and waved his hands. "Absolutely not! I work at a public school. I get a fixed salary every month. There's no 'extra income'."

"Look at you, treating your aunt like an outsider! No extra income, but you can afford such a beautiful mansion?"

You must be joking!

David scratched his head. "I really don't earn much, but my wife and daughter do. This mansion was bought by the two of them. It has nothing to do with me. Me? No real skills, just lucky enough to marry a good wife and have a good daughter."

Auntie Melissa: "..." I asked how you make money, and you told me how happy you are?

Can't you understand the question?!

And you call yourself a teacher!

Auntie Melissa felt the banister, then plopped down on the sofa to test its springiness. Finally, she stopped in front of the vase that had already caught Great-Aunt Deborah's eye—

"David, this is quite pretty. Is it an antique?"

David knew this aunt quite well. What she meant was:

I've taken a liking to this vase, but I won't say it outright. You should offer it to me.

He opened his mouth, about to say the vase was just a thirty-dollar find from the flower and bird market, but Auntie Melissa had already excitedly turned her attention elsewhere—

"My goodness! Wha-what is this stove thing? The one every foreign household has, spitting out little flames..."

David: "A fireplace."

"Yes, yes! This fire-place!"

"..."

"Must have cost a pretty penny to install one of these, right? Oh my, and that over there..."

David watched her running around, shoes still on, leaving yellow mud footprints on the floor as if she'd just come from the fields.

He took a deep breath and maintained his smile.

"Grandma, this TV can play games! I want to play games! Let me play games!" A child bouncing on the sofa waved the remote control, shouting and gesturing.

The voice was piercingly shrill.

David pinched the bridge of his nose, feeling a throbbing at his temples.

He turned around inadvertently and saw the jigsaw puzzle he had spent over half a month assembling on the bookshelf. It was now dismantled and scattered, some pieces even missing.

He gave a bitter smile.

What a mess this is...

Looking around, the spacious mansion was almost filled with adults, elders, and children. Some were chatting while cracking sunflower seeds, some were埋头 eating fruit, and children were running around chasing each other, their laughter loud enough to lift the roof.

It was more chaotic than a marketplace.

David thought about having to endure this for two more days, and his eyelid started twitching violently.

…

Although Isabella had given her a heads-up, Sophia was still shocked the moment she stepped through the door.
###Chapter 236

The light gray floor was covered in footprints.

Sunflower seed shells and snack wrappers were scattered everywhere.

Two black scuff marks marred the wall.

The constant buzz of chatter was giving her a headache.

Sophia Sullivan looked at Isabella.

Her mother offered a strained smile. "See what I mean?"

Sophia just wanted to turn around and leave.

But it was too late.

The relatives had already surrounded her.

"David's daughter is back? So pretty!"

"Getting your Master's at MIT, right? So accomplished!"

"Not married yet? Don't study so much you become an old maid!"

Sophia forced herself to respond with a few pleasantries.

She excused herself to use the restroom to escape.

She hurried upstairs to her room.

The door was open.

A quick check confirmed nothing was missing.

She sighed in relief and closed the door.

Dinner was takeout ordered by Isabella.

A dozen people ate, their mouths greasy.

David Sullivan was still the one washing dishes.

Great-Aunt Deborah stopped him. "Why are you doing this?"

David adjusted his apron. "Just cleaning the kitchen."

"Let your wife do it!"

"She has work."

"What work has to be done at night?"

"She can do it on her computer."

"It can't wait a moment longer?"

David smiled. "I usually handle the cleanup."

Great-Aunt Deborah's eyes widened. "You always do it?"

"Whoever has time does it."

"A man shouldn't be tied to the stove."

"My wife is the primary earner."

Great-Aunt Deborah was speechless. Was he actually proud of this?

David retreated into the kitchen, ending the conversation.

The old woman frowned, watching his efficient movements.

By nine PM, Sophia was exhausted.

She had just lain down when a tremendous crash echoed.

She rushed downstairs to investigate.

Two children had pulled the television onto the floor.

The screen was completely shattered.

Their parents scolded them, then offered apologies.

Their words were smooth. "David is doing so well now, this little amount doesn't matter, right?"

"Kids will be kids. Don't take it to heart."

David looked at the ruined TV, his heart aching.

Over ten thousand dollars.

He could only resign himself to the loss.

Early the next morning, Sophia was awakened by noise.

It wasn't even six yet.

Downstairs, she found several women watching short dramas on their phones.

The volume was blaring.

Isabella was jolted awake too.

Mother and daughter met at the top of the stairs.

Isabella touched Sophia's cheek. "Did they wake you?"

Sophia shook her head. "I'm going out to buy breakfast."

She fled the house.

Isabella looked at the chaotic living room and sighed.

Great-Aunt Deborah approached. "It's seven. Aren't you making breakfast?"

Isabella maintained her smile. "Sophia went to get breakfast."

"Buy it?" The old woman's voice rose. "That's so expensive outside! You just look down on us country folk!"

Isabella explained patiently. "Cooking for so many is troublesome. It's easier this way."

"My daughter-in-law never complains about cooking for dozens during harvest! You're just lazy! A woman's place is to serve her man!"

Isabella felt a vein throbbing at her temple.

The old woman grew more agitated. "I even brought you eggs back in the day! How did you turn out like this?"
###Chapter 237

Don't make excuses.

I'm not from the city.

I can't get used to that outside food.

I'm your elder.

Is it too much to ask you to make breakfast?

If you refuse,

I'll go have a word with your mother-in-law!

She began to moan.

One moment complaining of a headache.

The next, saying she was starving.

The others gathered around.

All blaming Isabella.

Isabella looked at the group.

They had always ganged up to bully others.

Great-Aunt Deborah wants a home-cooked breakfast?

Fine.

I'll have David make it for you.

Just wait a moment.

No!

I want you to make it!

Not David!

Men earn money.

Women cook.

That's the natural order!

I understand.

But...

I earn more than David in this family.

I also bought this villa.

By your logic,

It's only natural for David to cook.

Nonsense—

You could afford a villa this big?!

The old woman's eyes widened.

Yes.

Auntie Melissa nudged her shoulder.

Lowered her voice.

Looked embarrassed.

I asked David yesterday.

The villa really was bought by his wife...

The old woman froze.

Isabella ignored her.

Turned and went back to her study.

No way...

How could a woman earn that much money?

And buy a big villa?!

The old woman stood there, stunned.

Auntie Melissa smirked.

If I could earn that much,

I wouldn't cook either.

I'd wait for a man to cook for me.

When you have money,

Who bothers with the kitchen?

If it were you,

Would you?

The old woman was speechless.

Right.

When you have money,

Why slave away for a man?

...

Sophia Sullivan returned with breakfast.

She sensed the tense atmosphere.

Before she could figure out what happened,

A loud smash came from the backyard!

It was where David Sullivan kept his potted plants.

Sophia's heart jumped.

A bad feeling washed over her.

She went to look.

David's prized orchid lay shattered on the ground.

Other plants were damaged too.

David was trembling.

His heart aching.

His orchid...

He had nurtured it day and night.

Filled a whole notebook with observations.

Finally waited for it to bloom.

And now it was destroyed by these brats?!

The kids had no idea what they'd done.

They grinned and asked David.

"Uncle David,

Isn't this flower pretty?

We just picked it.

For you.

Hehe..."

Sophia glanced at David's livid face.

Worried his blood pressure would spike.

Thankfully, Mr. Sullivan had years of teaching experience.

He kept his composure.

He didn't yell.

But he couldn't smile either.

"Hehe"?

No "hehe."

Sophia couldn't stand it.

She grabbed her laptop and left.

Right.

One more day.

...

Sophia could escape.

David and Isabella could not.

These were still visiting relatives.

The couple had to play host.

Otherwise, Eleanor Yuan would be furious.

That afternoon,

William Sullivan and his wife Sophia "dropped by."

They claimed they were visiting.

But really, they came to enjoy the drama.

William had some conscience.

He couldn't help his brother.

But he didn't want to rub salt in the wound.

He greeted them and tried to leave.

But Sophia Sullivan yanked him back.

Gave him a warning look.

She first toured the villa.

Smiled and greeted the relatives.

Then she crossed her arms and approached Isabella.

"Sister-in-law,

No offense,

But this place is a mess.

Don't you ever clean?"

Isabella had tried.

But within half an hour of cleaning,

It would be worse than before.

"Sophia,

People will think you're lazy.

Look at this floor.

There's mud.

And that pile on the table.

It stinks.

What is all that?"

"Ugh.

This towel is black.

Why are you keeping it?

To clean the toilet?"

Great-Aunt Deborah walked over.

Snatched it away.

"What are you doing with my face towel?"

Sophia Sullivan...

"A-Anyway, tomorrow is Mom's big eightieth birthday banquet.

We can put up with some mess among family.

But if outsiders see this,

It would be so embarrassing.

You should really put in some effort, sister-in-law!"

She turned away in disgust.

As if she couldn't bear to look.

Isabella's expression darkened.

William tugged at Sophia's clothes.

Signaling her to stop.

Sophia shook him off angrily.

"Why are you pulling me?

I'm not done!"

Isabella suddenly smiled.

"With this many people, of course it's messy.

Actually, you should thank us.

Otherwise, your house would be the dirty, messy one right now."

Sophia was speechless.

Isabella was a cultured woman, after all.

"If you've benefited,

Keep a low profile.

Don't bite the hand that feeds you."

"You—"

"If you have nothing better to do, second sister-in-law,

Why not help me clean?

You said yourself we can't embarrass the Sullivan family."

She went to get a broom.

Sophia looked horrified.

"I—I just remembered something.

I have to go!"

She dragged William away as fast as she could.

...

Finally, the birthday banquet arrived the next day.

After the feast at the hotel,

The relatives and friends all went home.

David and Isabella finally breathed a sigh of relief.

But that night,

When the family of three returned home,

They found Great-Aunt Deborah's family still there?!

David was stunned.

"...Great-Aunt,

What's this?

Didn't the bus back to the village leave this afternoon?"

"Oh.

Eleanor said,

Since it's been so long since we've seen each other,

We should stay a few more days.

The birthday girl insisted.

I couldn't refuse her, could I?"

Eleanor Yuan had just been polite.

A casual remark.

She didn't expect them to take it seriously.

But since they did,

It was at the third son's place anyway.

It didn't affect her.

An easy chance to be the good person.

No reason not to take it.

David and Isabella exchanged a look.

They felt utterly hopeless.

...

Sophia got a message from Hannah Morse.

She ignored the uninvited relatives lingering in the living room.

Went straight upstairs.

Some experimental data was incomplete.

It needed manual entry.

Sophia had the original data.

She had printed a copy when she left the lab that day.

It came in handy now.

She replied to Hannah.

Headed to her room.

She had brought some paper documents this time.

Afraid the relatives might mess with them,

She had locked her room.

She was always careful when entering and leaving.

But as soon as she pushed the door open,

Sophia knew something was wrong!

The desk had clearly been disturbed.

Her open laptop was closed.

The pen holder was knocked over.

Pens were scattered everywhere.

The chair was pushed into a corner.

But that wasn't the worst part.

The worst part was—

The documents were gone!
###Chapter 238

Sophia Sullivan walked briskly into the room.

She opened her laptop.

The surveillance camera in the corner silently recorded everything.

She pulled up the day's footage.

The clear image showed a small figure sneaking into the room.

It was Great-Aunt Deborah's precious grandson, Wayne.

Sophia closed her laptop and went downstairs.

The elderly woman was engrossed in watching television.

The child's parents were sprawled on the sofa, munching on fruit and scrolling through their phones.

The brat was on his tiptoes, about to pull down another framed puzzle.

Sophia moved swiftly to stop him.

"You were in my room."

"Where are the documents from the desk?"

"Return them. Now."

Her voice was icy cold.

The child shrank back in fear.

His eyes darted around before he suddenly burst into loud, fake tears.

"Why is my baby crying?"

"Who hurt you? Tell Mommy!"

The phone-obsessed couple instantly sprang up.

The woman scooped up her child.

The man clenched his fists and glared at Sophia.

They had heard the commotion but chose to ignore it.

They only intervened when the child cried, immediately taking his side.

"Wayne is your elder!"

"How dare you, an adult, bully a child?"

The woman stroked her son's head tenderly.

But her eyes shot daggers at Sophia.

"I just asked him to return something."

"Is that bullying?"

"You must bully others quite often yourselves."

Sophia's expression remained neutral.

"You lost something and immediately blame my son?"

"On what grounds!"

The woman shrieked in rebuttal.

David Sullivan and Isabella Sullivan arrived upon hearing the noise.

"David, you came just in time!"

"Your daughter is accusing my son of theft!"

"You must give us an explanation today!"

The man puffed up with self-importance, relying on his senior status.

David's face darkened instantly.

"The matter isn't clear yet."

"How do you know it's a false accusation?"

"I know my daughter."

"She doesn't make baseless accusations."

The man was stunned into silence.

Isabella quietly moved to shield her daughter.

Seeing this, the woman sat down on the floor and began to wail.

"My son is the best behaved boy!"

"So what if he took something?"

"It's just a few pieces of paper!"

"Can you afford to compensate for scaring my son like this?"

Sophia raised an eyebrow with a cold laugh.

"I never said it was paper."

The woman's expression froze.

David quickly spoke up.

"Those are important documents!"

"Sophia never falsely accuses anyone!"

"Return the items immediately!"

The woman jutted out her chin defiantly.

"Her word means nothing!"

"I said we won't return it, so we won't!"

Sophia directly took out her phone and called the police.

The woman snorted in disdain.

The police wouldn't bother with a few pieces of paper.

Half an hour later, four police officers arrived.

"Who called?"

The woman rushed forward first.

"Officers, it's a misunderstanding!"

"The children were playing and lost a few papers!"

"We can handle this ourselves!"

Sophia stepped forward.

"I called the police."

She handed over a USB drive and her student ID.

"This is the surveillance footage."

"I am a graduate student at MIT."

"The missing items are experimental data."

"They involve academic secrets."

She bowed solemnly.

"Please retrieve the materials."

The officers' expressions immediately turned serious.

MIT graduate student.

Biology major.

Experimental data.

The combination of these words signaled something significant.

"Don't worry, Miss Sullivan."

"We will recover the confidential files."

The woman was completely dumbfounded.

How did a few pieces of paper become confidential?

Panic set in, but she remained stubborn.

Great-Aunt Deborah suddenly rushed over.

She raised her hand and slapped her grandson hard.

Smack!
###Chapter 239

A slap landed heavily.

The sound was sharp and clear.

"What did I tell you before we left?! Behave, don't touch other people's things! Did you forget everything?! Hand it over now! Looks like you need a lesson! You good-for-nothing—"

The old woman moved swiftly.

She started yelling right after hitting.

No one had time to react.

The child was completely stunned.

The parents were dumbfounded.

Sophia Sullivan stood frozen.

"Waaah— Grandma hit me! Waaah—"

The brat burst into loud sobs.

This time, the tears were real.

Snot and tears streamed down his face.

"I didn't take it! I don't know where it is!"

"Talking back? I'll teach you a lesson!" The old woman was frantic with anger.

"I won't tell! Beat me to death and I still won't tell!"

"Stealing things! Being a delinquent!" The old woman hit harder, smacking his bottom repeatedly.

The man and woman rushed to stop her.

They couldn't hold her back.

"You old hag— How dare you hit me— Why aren't you dead yet—"

The old woman trembled with rage.

Finally, the police officer intervened.

The old woman stopped.

The brat was subdued.

Sniffling, he pulled a stack of documents from under the sofa.

Police officer: "Miss Sullivan, please check?"

Sophia confirmed it was correct.

She nodded. "It's this report."

"Good."

Sophia put the documents away.

She looked at the parents. "My room was locked. He climbed in through the window. The second floor is over ten meters high. What if he had fallen? Then it wouldn't be documents lost, but a life!"

The couple's faces turned pale.

The brat lowered his head, not daring to make a sound.

That night, Great-Aunt Deborah's family packed and returned to the village.

David Sullivan saw it was late.

He offered to let them stay the night before leaving.

Great-Aunt Deborah sighed. "David, your family are all good, honest people. Not like your mother... Be more careful from now on..."

She finished and left with her family.

David frowned.

Be more careful?

About whom?

...

That night, the Sullivan family slept soundly.

Early the next morning, Isabella Sullivan hired three housekeepers.

They worked all morning.

The house was thoroughly cleaned inside and out.

After breakfast, Sophia went out for a walk.

She remembered a private bookstore on West Street.

Last time, she found an out-of-print professional book there.

The owner refused to sell it.

She could only read it in the store.

She hadn't finished it before going home.

Today was a good day to finish it.

She searched the bookstore twice.

She couldn't find the book.

She asked the manager.

Manager: "That book was sold yesterday."

Sophia: "I thought it was the owner's private collection and not for sale?"

The manager nodded. "It wasn't supposed to be sold. But the person who came yesterday was the owner's friend. They have a life-saving bond. The owner agreed to sell it personally. Sorry."

Sophia waved it off, saying it was fine.

Disappointment was evident in her eyes.

It had started raining outside at some point.

Sophia browsed for a while.

She couldn't find a second out-of-print book.

She sighed softly and prepared to leave.

Through the floor-to-ceiling window, she saw the rain was still falling.

She couldn't leave for now.

Suddenly, her gaze paused.

It landed on a man sheltering from the rain outside the bookstore.

She pushed the door open and walked out.

Tentatively, she called out—

"Big Brother?"

The man turned around.

His eyes lit up. "Sophia?"

It was really Ryan Sullivan!

The only son of William Sullivan and Sophia Sullivan.

He didn't have an umbrella.

His T-shirt was mostly wet.

Water dripped from the ends of his hair.

Sophia offered him a tissue. "Dry off. You can still catch a cold from summer rain."

"Thank you." He took the tissue and wiped his face. "You're still so thoughtful and caring."

The bookstore connected to the adjacent mall.

Since they met and it was raining.

The siblings decided to have a meal together.

Sophia called Isabella to say she wouldn't be home for lunch.

Isabella asked a few questions and hung up.

In the private dining room—

Soft, pleasant music played.

It eased the gloom of the rainy day.

They sat by the window.

The floor-to-ceiling glass blocked the sound of rain.

Leaving only the view of the rain outside.

Sophia ordered the signature dishes.

While waiting, she looked out the window.

There were few pedestrians.

Cars streamed past.

Her gaze returned and unexpectedly met Ryan's eyes.

Sophia was startled.

She smiled shyly.

She and Ryan had been very close as children.

They were only three years apart.

They often played together.

They kept in touch frequently during middle and high school.

Every time Ryan visited her at Second High, he brought delicious food.

Sophia remembered clearly.

Sometimes it was fruit or bread.

Sometimes it was cookies or snacks.

Occasionally, there were even spicy strips...

Those were the happiest times during tedious studies.

In college, she was busy with studies and romance.

Ryan was busy with internships and work.

They contacted each other less.

After college, Sophia devoted herself to Ethan Roscente.

She endured hardship with him as he started his business, taking care of his daily life.

Ryan quit his job and started a business with friends.

He was incredibly busy.

They gradually lost touch.

Occasionally, she thought about calling to say hello.

But it felt too sudden and abrupt.

They both felt this way.

Slowly, they stopped contacting each other.

Some friends just drift apart.

Fortunately, the bond of blood remained.

Now, meeting again, they didn't feel distant.

Ryan: "Sophia, you haven't changed at all."

She was still the little sister from his memories.

Quiet and beautiful.

Her eyes always held a light.

"Really?" Sophia was delighted.

Those six years had exhausted her.

Looking back now, she felt like she had been under a spell.

She had experienced her darkest moments.

She thought she would decay.

Fortunately, she finally broke free.

But after going through so much.

The person who returned was not the same as before.

Yet Ryan said she hadn't changed at all!

Sophia was genuinely happy.

"Brother, you've changed."

Ryan touched his chin. "Older, right?"

"No, taller."

In her memory, Ryan was around 1.7 meters.

Now, she estimated he was at least 180.

His skin was a healthy tan.

His teeth were white when he smiled.

After all these years of struggle.

He still retained the clean purity of his youth.
###Chapter 240

Exquisite dishes covered the table.

Ryan Sullivan's phone kept buzzing.

All business-related messages.

He finally found a moment to look at Sophia. "I was too busy at Grandma's birthday banquet yesterday to talk with you."

"It's fine."

His status as the eldest Sullivan grandson kept him constantly occupied with social engagements.

"I heard you're doing your Master's at MIT? I'm in Kyoto. Call me if you need anything. My number hasn't changed."

"I still have it saved," Sophia nodded. "Thanks, Ryan."

"You've become more formal." He raised an eyebrow.

"More polite," she corrected him.

Ryan chuckled softly.

"What are you doing in Kyoto, Ryan?"

"Started a smart home installation company with some friends," he said, serving himself some food. "Whole-home automation. Robot commands, climate control, automated systems…"

The rise of AI was reshaping the industry.

Traditional interior design still dominated the market.

Smart home integration had low consumer acceptance.

He had studied Computer Science and AI, so this venture aligned with his expertise.

Sophia didn't ask about the technical details. She just wanted to know how the business was doing.

Ryan gave a wry smile. "The renovation industry is fiercely competitive. Smart home integration is still a new concept. The initial phase is tough. We're barely scraping by."

He was being vague.

Sophia assumed it was just the usual startup struggles.

Until—

She was returning from the restroom and passed the small balcony.

Ryan was on a phone call.

"...Mr. Yang, we've worked together many times. You know me. I'd rather not make a profit myself than owe you money!"

"Starting a small company is hard. We haven't received the final payment from our last project. Cash flow is tight. I'll settle it by the day after tomorrow, at the latest."

"Yes, yes. Thank you for understanding…"

His back was slightly hunched.

The youthful straightness of his spine seemed weighed down by hardship, yet he was still forcing himself to stand tall.

Sophia quietly returned to her seat.

She didn't mention what she had just seen.

The meal concluded, and Ryan stood up to pay the bill.

"I'll drive you home."

"Okay. Thanks, Ryan."

…

The car stopped in front of her house.

Ryan drove off in a hurry.

David Sullivan came out upon hearing the engine. "Was that Ryan's car? You ran into him?"

Sophia linked her arm with his and guided him inside. "Yes. We had dinner together."

"Your eldest cousin has been in Kyoto for years. He sends plenty of gifts but rarely comes back. He handled most of the arrangements for the birthday banquet this time… He's becoming more and more like his father…" 
###Chapter 241

David mused.

The living room was restored to its tidy state.

Sophia collapsed onto the sofa, stretching her arms.

"Home is so much more comfortable."

"Three housekeepers cleaned for three hours. Your mother supervised personally. Didn't miss a single corner." David laughed.

Speaking of Isabella…

"Where is Mom?" Sophia looked around.

David: "She was watching TV just a moment ago. Vanished in the blink of an eye."

Isabella rushed out of the study, holding her phone.

Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes shining—

"It's exploded!"

David: "Huh?"

Sophia: "What exploded?"

Father and daughter exchanged confused looks.

Isabella took a deep breath. "The new book! My new book!"

Stone Macmillan worked quickly.

After their meeting in Kyoto, the publishing process advanced rapidly.

Early promotion: The return of suspense master Isabella Sullivan. Her latest horror masterpiece after twelve years, following 'The Weapon' and 'The Deserted Village School'.

It was a compelling hook.

But the response was lukewarm.

Isabella had been away from the suspense genre for too long. Her star power had faded.

New authors had emerged. Readers weren't convinced.

The current trend was "fandom culture," with authors marketed like idols.

Isabella had been offline for years. She had no social media presence and lacked a fan base.

The pre-release buzz for the new book was weak.

Isabella had been depressed for days.

Stone remained calm, reassuring her that trends were fleeting, but quality content was timeless.

'The Seven-Day Tales' was officially published a month ago.

Its original title was 'The Lantern,' but marketing suggested a name change for more impact.

The original title was retained in smaller print on the cover.

On its release day, national sales were a mere 72 copies.

It set a new record low for any title published under Stone's imprint.

Isabella's morale shattered.

She couldn't write. Facing Stone filled her with guilt.

He had given her his utmost trust and resources, with a signing fee reaching a million. The return was devastatingly poor.

She began to doubt if she was still cut out for writing.

Did anyone still want to read her books?

Could work that attracted no readers still be called creation?

Isabella was trapped in self-doubt.

David was anxious.

But he couldn't help.

Until—

Stone called.

"Professor Sullivan, do you know what the daily sales for 'The Seven-Day Tales' are now?"

Isabella's heart trembled.

Had they dropped to single digits?

"I'm sorry, Mr. Macmillan, I might…"
###Chapter 242

Stone's voice was brimming with excitement. "Sixty thousand!"

Isabella looked puzzled. "What sixty thousand?"

"Daily sales! Yesterday's single-day sales broke sixty thousand copies!"
"It shattered the record held by 'The Weapon'!"
"No new book has reached this height in nearly twenty years!"

"Isabella," he said, his tone grave. "Your new book—it's a smash hit!"

This wasn't just regular success. It was explosive.

At first, Stone had been frustrated.

He anticipated the launch wouldn't be smooth sailing, but he never expected it to be this quiet.

An editor from a rival house, with whom he'd never gotten along, finally seized the chance to mock his declining judgment.
They sneered at him for signing a has-been author and pouring a huge marketing budget into a project doomed to fail.

Stone ignored the gossip.

He was busy figuring out where things went wrong.

He had read all of Isabella's work carefully.
Neither the subject matter nor the plots were lacking.
Every book had the potential to be a major hit.

They had specifically chosen what they thought was her best work for the debut.
Yet the result was unexpectedly poor...

It didn't make sense.

Was Isabella truly past her prime?

She had been absent from the thriller scene for a decade.
But "The Weapon" and "The Deserted Village School" were still on the bestseller lists, with steady monthly sales.

This proved her reader base still existed.

The more he thought about it, the more something felt off. He immediately called a meeting with the marketing team.

The content wasn't the problem. The author's reputation wasn't the problem.
The issue had to be the marketing strategy!

Sure enough—

Upon closer questioning, he discovered the marketing focus had been on platforms like Twitter and Instagram, which are popular with younger users.

But Isabella's core readership was primarily between thirty and fifty years old.

No wonder there was no splash. They had completely targeted the wrong audience!

He immediately adjusted the strategy.
He instructed the team to focus on book recommendation forums and literary discussion boards.
He even arranged for some offline advertising.

That very day, "Seven Days" sales broke ten thousand copies.
In the following days, they continued to climb steadily.

The real breakthrough came from a post two weeks ago by a blogger called "ChubbyReader".

[My dad, a math teacher who gets a headache from reading, is actually glued to a book, forgetting to eat and sleep!]

[Pic][Pic][Pic]

The three photos vividly captured a middle-aged man completely absorbed in reading, the book's cover clearly visible.

This blogger was famous for sharing funny stories about his father, who was more popular than the blogger himself.

Fans were shocked to see their familiar "laid-back dad" seriously reading a book.

Many grew curious and searched for the book's title.
They discovered it was a physical book with no e-book version available.

For most, curiosity ended there.
###Chapter 243

But some were determined to see what was so captivating.

Since it was available online, they placed orders directly.

And then—

[I never read fiction, but I stayed up all night finishing this!]

[Read it under the covers at midnight, shivering in fear.]

[My mom thought I was having a medical emergency and almost called an ambulance.]

[Couldn't stop reading it in one go. Went looking for the author's other works... and nearly scared myself to death.]

[Is it really that scary? Now I have to check it out!]

[Trust me, you'll never look at tofu pudding the same way again.]

[Why?]

[The answer is in the book.]

Two days later, "ChubbyReader" posted again.
This time, there was no photo of his father, just a picture of the "Seven Days" cover.

The caption: Suddenly realizing the older generation's taste in books is actually pretty good.

Riding this wave of popularity, "Seven Days" successfully broke into the younger reader market.

And then, the younger readers...

Were completely hooked!

In less than two weeks, fan clubs, forums, and support sites sprang up everywhere.

Older readers sighed with emotion—their treasured author could no longer stay hidden!

It was then that fans of "Seven Days" suddenly realized something.
Where was the author?

The book was so popular, yet there was no news about the author at all?

With other books, if there was even a hint of popularity, the author would quickly claim it to gain followers.

"Seven Days" had been trending so many times, but the author remained silent, almost like she had disappeared?

Isabella truly had no idea.

She had long left the internet behind.
She didn't use social media and used a basic old-fashioned phone.

It wasn't that she couldn't use modern technology.
She simply preferred this slower pace of life, reminiscent of "the old days."

She didn't want to be influenced by online noise.
She only wanted to focus on writing the stories she loved.
So, she had proactively cut off most external connections.

Whether it was slander and abuse, or applause and praise, she blocked it all out.

...

Sophia listened, immediately pulling out her phone to search for the book title: Seven Days...

Good grief, information was everywhere.

There were reader recommendations, critic reviews, and, of course, criticisms and comparisons.

But one thing was undeniable—

"Seven Days" was truly a hit, a massive smash hit!

"Mom, you're amazing! I knew you could do it."

David snatched the phone, scrolling down a few pages. "Heh... they're all praising you!"

"My wife is a famous author now. Does that mean I'll become famous too?"

"Um..." Sophia scratched her head. "Dad, you're already kind of famous."

"Huh?"

"It's just... your reputation might not be that great..."

David: "??"

The ultimate villain in "Seven Days" was a seemingly ordinary physics teacher, based on David.

"!"

...

As the book's popularity grew, so did readers' curiosity about the author.

Stone decided to strike while the iron was hot.
He arranged a book signing for Isabella at the Kinokuniya Books in Kyoto.

The moment the announcement was made, hype instantly skyrocketed.

In less than two hours, over ten thousand people had registered, stunning the entire marketing team.

Stone wasn't surprised at all. "In the age of traffic,it is just the surface. Content is king."

The signing was scheduled for three days later.
It worked out perfectly, as David and Isabella could travel north with Sophia.

The next morning, a light drizzle fell.

Sophia hailed a cab.
###Chapter 244
The driver helped load the luggage into the trunk, and the family of three got in.

Inside the train station, with half an hour until boarding, Sophia brought out the chestnut cake she had prepared earlier for breakfast.

Isabella didn't like things too sweet. The chestnut flavor was just right.
David Sullivan had a bowl of plain noodles before heading out, leaving him comfortably full.

He pulled a thick book from his backpack and began reading intently.

Twenty minutes later, the boarding announcement came over the speakers.

Isabella Sullivan and Sophia Sullivan traveled light and walked ahead.

They scanned their IDs and passed through the turnstile smoothly.

They waited inside for David.

David was dragging his suitcase and also carrying Isabella's bag.

He reached for his pocket and suddenly froze.

His wallet was gone!

He remembered being bumped from behind while in line.

The person who bumped him was quick, managing to swipe his wallet.

"Dad, hurry up!" Sophia waved from inside the gate.

David turned pale. "My wallet's gone. My ID was inside."

Sophia was stunned.
"Use your phone," she suggested immediately. "You can apply for a temporary ID on the app."

There wasn't much cash in the wallet, and the ID could be replaced.
David gave a wry smile. "My phone... was stolen too."

Sophia was completely speechless.

David suddenly spotted a familiar figure in the crowd.
It was the person who had bumped him earlier!
"Stop, thief!" He dropped his luggage and charged forward.

Sophia and Isabella tried to follow but were stopped by staff.
"Regulations state you cannot return after ticket inspection. Please use the exit and re-enter from there."

The exit was a long way from the waiting hall.
Isabella was anxious. "My husband went after a thief. I'm very worried about him..."

"Sorry, rules are rules."

Sophia calmed down. "Can you notify the police on duty to help?"
"Don't worry, we've already dispatched officers."

Sophia felt slightly reassured.
She picked up her father's suitcase and walked with Isabella toward the exit.

...

Meanwhile, David stopped, panting heavily.
A young man handed him his wallet and phone.
"Sir, check if everything's there?"

David checked. "Yes, it's all mine! Thank you so much, young man!"
"Just doing what anyone would do."

"What's your name?"
"Sebastian Evans."

...

"Dad—"

Sophia and Isabella rushed over, having walked for nearly twenty minutes.
David waved his wallet. "Got everything back!"

Isabella looked him over. "Are you hurt?"
"I'm fine, just warmed up from running."

The family of three returned to the waiting hall.
Their train had already left. Sophia used her phone to rebook the next available one.
The earliest train was in an hour.

They found some empty seats and sat down.
David suddenly stood up and waved into the distance. "Sebastian!"

Sophia and Isabella looked up.

Sebastian didn't realize he was being called at first.
It wasn't until David called his name a third time that he turned around.
His eyes immediately landed on Sophia.

His expression brightened, and he strode over.
David warmly shook his hand. "What a coincidence!"

Sebastian's gaze swept over David, then settled on Sophia.
These two...

"Dad, you know him?" Sophia approached, sounding surprised.

Dad?
A slight smile touched Sebastian's lips.

He was originally supposed to fly back to Kyoto, but his flight was canceled due to weather.
His secretary had booked him a train ticket instead.
He never expected...
Such a pleasant surprise.

David laughed. "This young man here helped me get my wallet back just now!"
Sophia paused for a moment. "Thank you, Mr. Evans."

"Don't mention it. Anyone would have done the same."

Isabella was curious. "You two know each other?"
Sophia and Sebastian nodded simultaneously. "Yes."

As for how they knew each other...
Now was clearly not the time for details.
Isabella didn't press further.

David asked, "Sebastian, where are you headed?"
"Back to Kyoto."
"What a coincidence! We're going to Kyoto too. Which train are you on?"

Sebastian asked casually, "And you?"
David told him the train number.
Sebastian smiled. "What a coincidence, that's my train too."
"Perfect! We can go together!"
"Alright."

Sebastian let David pull him down to sit.
While chatting, he quickly took out his phone and changed his ticket.
An inconvenience could easily become a fortunate coincidence.

...

A railway police officer came to take David's statement.
Since the lost items were recovered, a signature was needed for confirmation.
David cooperated fully.
Isabella went with him, taking the chance to stretch her legs.

Only Sophia and Sebastian remained in the seats.
People milled around, but the atmosphere between them was subtly charged.

Sebastian spoke softly, "Earlier, in front of your parents, you still called me Mr. Evans."
His tone held a hint of complaint.

Sophia blinked. "What else should I call you? I always call you that."
"Mr. Evans is too formal. You're a student. Using such a corporate title might make your parents misunderstand."
"I don't know if they'd misunderstand, but you're definitely overthinking it."

Sebastian was speechless.
"Is calling me 'Seb' that difficult?"

Sophia shook her head seriously. "Yes. I don't make a habit of casually calling people 'brother,' unless you actually are my brother."
Like how she naturally called Ryan Sullivan.

Sebastian immediately waved a hand. "Then Mr. Evans is fine."
Better than being relegated to brother status...

He suddenly pulled a book from his bag.
Before he could speak, Sophia exclaimed, "So you were the one who bought it!"

It was the out-of-print original language book she hadn't finished reading at the West Street bookstore!
Sebastian raised an eyebrow. "The owner is a friend. He reluctantly parted with it and gave it to me."
He just gave it to him...
Sophia felt a twinge of envy.

"Here." He offered her the book.
"...What?" She was startled and quickly waved her hands. "But he gave it to you..."

Sebastian smiled. "I was always going to give it to you."
What else would he do with such a specialized book?
He couldn't understand a word of it.
Sophia Sullivan accepted the card.

The temptation was too great.

She couldn't resist.

"Thank you."

"Call me Seb."

"..."

They arrived in Kyoto in the afternoon.

Sophia and her family were not in the same train car as Sebastian Evans.

She was about to call a ride after exiting the station.

Then she saw him standing not far away.

He was tall, standing out in the crowd.

Sebastian walked toward David Sullivan with a smile. "Sir, my car is right outside. May I give you a ride home?"

David was taken aback. "No need to trouble yourself. We can call a car."

"It's on my way." Sebastian took the suitcase from him and walked straight out.

"Well then, thank you, Sebastian."

"No trouble at all."

Sophia silently closed the ride-hailing app and put her phone away.

In the car.

Sebastian sat in the driver's seat, steering with practiced ease.

Sophia took the passenger seat.

Isabella and David sat in the back.

"That copy of 'The Comprehensive Mirror' you have, sir, is it the 2003 reprint?" Sebastian glanced through the rearview mirror.

David immediately perked up. "You know this book?"

"My grandfather studied history. I picked up a little. If I recall correctly, editions after 2010 removed two historical units. There seemed to be an earlier removal too?"

David's eyes lit up. "More than once! It was removed three times total!"

"The most recent was 2010, before that was 2004. The earliest one is unclear. I remember the version I read as a child had thirty-six units. The one you hold now is from before the second removal—thirty units. The last two removals took four units, so there must have been an earlier one."

"1996." Sebastian said suddenly.

David: "What?"

"If there was another removal, it must have been 1996."

"Why are you so sure?" David asked curiously.

"Wasn't sure before. But you said there was one before 2004. It was probably the edition my grand-uncle oversaw. That was 1996."

David was astonished. "What was your grand-uncle's name?"

"Shen Tangzhi."

"Professor Shen is your grand-uncle?!"

Sebastian nodded. "You've heard of him?"

"Of course! Such a renowned translator and scholar! How could I not?!"

Sebastian turned the steering wheel. His gaze occasionally flicked to Sophia, then back to the mirror. "Pre-1996 editions are hard to find. But my grand-uncle moved abroad when I was in high school. He left all his out-of-print books to me."

"I can look for it when I get back. Should be able to find it."

David's eyes shone, though he verbally declined. "That... seems like too much trouble."

They weren't related. Why would he show him?

Sebastian smiled. "No trouble. Books are meant for those who appreciate them. Better than gathering dust on a shelf."

"Heh... well then, I won't stand on ceremony. Thank you!"

Sebastian: "That's more like it."

They'd be family soon anyway.

Isabella listened to their book talk. She glanced at her daughter and asked casually, "Your family is very literary, Sebastian? What kind of books do you usually enjoy?"

"Mostly essays and novels at home. Personally, I like thrilling, unconventional stories. I just finished your new book, 'The Seven-Day Dialogue,' ma'am. The ending was stunning."

Isabella was surprised he'd read her work. "You know I wrote 'The Seven-Day Dialogue'?"

Sebastian's eyes swept over Sophia. "Yes, I know."

As for how he knew...

Sebastian didn't say.

Isabella didn't ask.

Only Sophia suffered, scrutinized by the gazes of these two clever people.

Sigh...

"So, was the killer really the physics teacher?"

Isabella was surprised. "Why do you ask that?"

The book's ending pointed all clues toward the physics teacher.

He used his scientific knowledge to plan the perfect crime.

The evidence seemed conclusive. Yet Sebastian asked if it was really him.

Isabella's gaze deepened.

Sebastian: "There were a few subtle descriptions..."

First, the misaligned shadow in the stairwell.

Second, the murder weapon that vanished inexplicably. It was found later, but its disappearance was never explained.

Third, two pairs of slippers in the lone girl's apartment. The book said they were for guests. But why were they men's slippers?

Would a woman living alone frequently invite men over and specially prepare slippers for them?

It didn't make sense.

Even if she did, they should be women's slippers.

"...These hidden clues suggest the real killer is someone else. Of course," Sebastian changed his tone, "this is just my personal theory."

Isabella smiled. "When you ask these questions, you must already have the answer in mind."

Sebastian also smiled. "So there will be a sequel, right?"

Isabella didn't answer.

But her silent smile said it all.

Sebastian stopped at the alley entrance. Sophia thanked him and got out with her parents.

"Thank you, Sebastian."

"You're welcome, sir."

While going upstairs, David suddenly stopped.

"Wait... I never told him our address. How did he know to stop here?"

Sophia: "..." She felt inexplicably guilty.

Isabella shot him a look. "That's a question for Sophia, isn't it, sweetie?" Isabella smiled meaningfully.

David looked at his daughter, finally catching on. "Sophia, are you and Sebastian very close?"

Uh...

"He's helped me a few times. We're friends, but not that close."

"Not close, yet he's helped you multiple times?"

Sophia: "Maybe he's just a helpful person? Didn't he help you catch a thief today?"

David thought about it and nodded. "True."

Isabella: "..."

"Dad, stop asking. Let's go. The luggage is heavy."

"Give it to me, I'll carry it..."

On the drive back, Sebastian was in a great mood.

"Hey, Charlie. Call Julian. Let's get tea."

"...Get what?!" Charlie Lowell thought he misheard.

Sebastian: "Tea."

Charlie: "..."

Tea in the middle of the day?

He didn't get it.

Elegant Teahouse—

Julian Winston walked in and looked around, clicking his tongue. "What's this new game?"

Sebastian poured him a cup. "Try it. Freshly brewed."

Julian glanced at it, disdainful. "Tasteless. Not drinking."

Charlie, who had already drunk two cups, nodded vigorously. This guy was brave, saying what he didn't dare to.

Ethan Roscente pushed the door open.

Julian and Charlie froze, looking back and forth between him and Sebastian in shock and confusion.

They started exchanging meaningful glances.

Charlie: Did you call him?

Julian: Would I dare?
Ethan Roscente strode to the tea table.

"Sebastian Evans, what do you mean by this?"

"Mean by what?"

"Why is the development zone project halted?"

Sebastian Evans took a leisurely sip of tea.

"Didn't feel like cooperating, so I stopped it."

"You can just stop it like that? Do you know how much we lose per day?"

Sebastian nodded.

"I have a rough idea."

"And you still stopped it?!"

Sebastian began brewing the second infusion.

His movements were graceful and fluid.

Ethan Roscente pressed down on the teapot.

"Hiding for three days, and now playing mute?"

Sebastian looked up.

"Who's hiding?"

"Your secretary said you were on a business trip. Wasn't that to avoid me?"

"A site inspection in the neighboring city. The itinerary was set long ago."

Ethan Roscente narrowed his eyes.

"Neighboring city?"

Sebastian gave a light laugh.

Charlie Lowell leaned in.

"Brother Sebastian went to the neighboring city? That place has great food... Sister Sophia's hometown is there... Why did you elbow me?"

Julian Winston frantically signaled with his eyes.

Charlie Lowell immediately shut his mouth.

Ethan Roscente stared at Sebastian.

"You went to find her?"

Sebastian's tone was flat.

"Inspection."

"But I did run into Sophia."

"What did you call her?"

"Sophia."

Ethan Roscente grabbed him by the collar.

"Sebastian Evans, I warned you!"

Sebastian pushed him away.

He smoothed the wrinkles on his collar.

"Warning? In what capacity? Her ex-boyfriend? How laughable."

Ethan Roscente took a deep breath.

"So this is why you stopped the project? I thought you separated business from personal matters."

"Sophia Sullivan hates men who can't separate business and personal feelings."

The teacup landed heavily on the table.

It made a dull thud.

"Reverse psychology won't work."

"Ethan Roscente, what exactly do you want to discuss today?"

"Using Sophia Sullivan to talk about the project?"

"Not just this project. I will sever all cooperation."

"From now on, we draw a clear line."

Ethan Roscente's pupils constricted.

"What do you mean?"

"I mean exactly what I said."

"Just because I'm her ex-boyfriend? Sebastian Evans, are you insane? You don't want money anymore?"

They had over twenty joint projects.

A split meant all Initial investment would be lost.

A total loss.

"Is this necessary? If you want to pursue her, then go pursue her!"

"I haven't even mentioned splitting up, and you make the first move?"

"You think this will make her not mind?"

"Stupid!" Ethan Roscente snatched the teacup and smashed it.

"I never realized you were such a romantic fool before!"

Charlie Lowell and Julian Winston took two steps back.

They exchanged a glance.

Their hearts were pounding.

Sebastian was using such methods to cut ties?

Even when they had falling-outs before, it was only私下不来往.

They still made money as usual.

What did personal relationships matter in the face of profit?

They would never turn their backs on money.

What was wrong with Sebastian, that old fox?

Ethan Roscente was right.

They couldn't understand it either.

Sebastian looked at the fragments on the floor.

"What a pity."

"Just like Sophia Sullivan back then?"

Ethan Roscente frowned.

"What are you trying to say?"

Sebastian sneered.

"Petty? Immature? I'm happy to be."

"You can't bear to part with the money?"

Ethan Roscente gritted his teeth.

"You don't love money?"

"I do. But Sophia is more important."

Charlie Lowell and Julian Winston got goosebumps.

Sebastian continued.

"Even if I cut all ties cleanly, she might not agree."

"But so what?"

"I make my own choices."

"Whether she agrees or not is her consideration."

"I hope we are in sync, but if we're not, does that mean I shouldn't do it?"

"Ethan Roscente, this is the difference between you and me."

"You are unwilling to go all in for uncertainty."

"I will bet everything."

Ethan Roscente sneered.

"Even if certain to fail?"

Sebastian curled his lip.

"There is no certain failure, only people who don't give their all."

"You're crazy!"

"Perhaps."

He was happy to be.

Ethan Roscente said quietly.

"Does it have to be this way? Pursuing her and cooperating aren't mutually exclusive."

"In my boundaries, they are."

Ethan Roscente's eyes turned icy.

"If you want to go crazy, don't drag me down with you."

"I'm telling you in advance. Make plans early."

Ethan Roscente chukled.

"Throwing money into the sea."

Sebastian smiled faintly.

"Just to hear the splash."

Ethan Roscente turned to leave.

Sebastian spoke suddenly.

"This time in the neighboring city, I met Sophia Sullivan's parents."

Ethan Roscente's steps halted.
###Chapter 245

Sebastian Evans looked up.

His gaze was calm as he met Ethan Roscente's eyes.

"She grew up in a family filled with love."

Ethan's steps faltered.

Sebastian's voice was clear. "It means she knows how to love."

"And she has the courage to walk away from the wrong person."

"That's why she chose you without hesitation back then."

"Even against the whole world."

"Unfortunately."

"You betrayed that courage."

Ethan stood with his back turned, his fingers tightening slightly.

Sebastian continued. "Many say she's a hopeless romantic."

"But I know that's not true."

"She simply gives her all to every relationship."

"She seeks a proper beginning and end."

Each word pierced Ethan's heart like a needle.

He spun around abruptly.

His eyes were red. "Are you gloating?"

Sebastian nodded calmly. "You can think that if you want."

Ethan's face darkened instantly.

Sebastian remained composed.

A child raised in such a family demands purity in relationships.

She wants unreserved, unconditional favor.

Not a choice made after weighing the pros and cons.

Sebastian knew he wasn't perfect either.

He was accustomed to calculation and strategy.

In the past, he would never abandon a profitable project to pursue a woman.

But this time, he wanted to be reckless.

For Sophia Sullivan.

Once.

Twice.

Countless times.

Ethan slammed the door shut behind him.

The loud noise made the two men in the hallway flinch.

Charlie Lowell patted his chest. "Ethan looked terrifying."

Julian Winston nodded. "I almost thought they would come to blows."

A server entered to clean up the broken fragments.

Sebastian brewed the third pot of tea.

"Come taste this. The third brew is the best."

Julian accepted the teacup.

He couldn't tell the difference, but he remained silent.

Charlie rubbed his stomach and burped. "I can't drink anymore..."

Sebastian shook his head. "What a pity."

Charlie leaned in curiously. "Sebastian, did you really meet Sophia's parents?"

Julian pricked up his ears.

Sebastian raised an eyebrow. "Of course."

"Does that count as meeting the parents?"

"Not officially, but it helps build goodwill."

"Did it work?"

Sebastian rubbed the rim of his cup. "Probably."

Julian suddenly understood. "You invited us for tea just to show off?"

Sebastian lowered his head to sip his tea.

A slight smile touched his lips.

...

Ethan returned to his company.

He summoned his assistant.

"Compile all projects involving Sebastian Evans."

The assistant was stunned. "Including third-party projects?"

"All of them."

An hour later, the documents were delivered to his office.

Ethan quickly scanned through them.

He called in the project manager.

"Terminate all of these."

The manager was shocked. "But these are key projects..."

Ethan's gaze was icy. "Do it."

The manager broke out in a cold sweat. "Why..."

"No questions."

...

Over twenty projects were terminated.

The workload to control losses was immense.

Ethan worked late into the night.

He stood before the floor-to-ceiling window.

The city lights twinkled in the distance.

Sebastian's words echoed in his ears.

Regret, it seemed, had layers.

The most painful was when everyone told you what a wonderful person you had missed.

But they only said it when it was too late to win back.

A sense of powerlessness washed over him.

It peaked when he returned to the empty mansion.

What could he do?

Sebastian had already met her parents...

...

Morning sunlight streamed in.

Sophia Sullivan woke early to prepare breakfast.

She didn't wake her parents.

She ate alone and went out for a morning run.

She had no classes in the morning.

She stopped by the market on her way back.

David Sullivan and Isabella Sullivan woke to find breakfast ready.

The ingredients for lunch had also been bought.

"Sophia, you're up so early?"

"I woke up at six-thirty."

David entered the kitchen and saw the fresh pork ribs.

"You went grocery shopping?"

Sophia nodded. "Shall we have braised pork ribs for lunch?"

"Good. I'll cook them."

A sudden knock sounded at the door.

Isabella was eating breakfast.

She wondered who would visit so early.

She opened the door.

First, she saw a pile of exquisite gift boxes.

Then she looked up and saw the visitor's face.

It looked familiar, but she couldn't place it immediately.

"Who are you?"

Ethan's smile was stiff. "Auntie, I'm Ethan Roscente."

Isabella's expression instantly turned cold.

"What are you doing here?"

"I heard you and Uncle were in Kyoto. I came to pay my respects."

Isabella didn't accept the gifts.

Her scrutinizing gaze fell on his face.

Ethan felt awkward.

In their six years together, he had only met Sophia's parents once.

It was a hurried meal before he excused himself and left.

In his memory, they were ordinary and unremarkable.

Completely unnoticeable.
###Chapter 246

So slender...

We cannot accept these gifts.

We've done nothing to deserve them.

We are not family.

Nor are we close friends.

Regardless of their value.

We cannot take them.

You and Sophia are over.

You are strangers now.

There is even less reason to accept anything from you.

Isabella's voice was gentle.

But her tone was firm.

She remembered the first time she met Ethan Roscente.

She and David Sullivan had waited nearly half an hour at the restaurant.

Ethan arrived empty-handed.

He simply called them 'Uncle' and 'Auntie'.

Then buried himself in his food.

He hardly initiated a single conversation the entire time.

Only one phrase came to Isabella's mind then.

He was not her match.

Such a man was utterly wrong for her daughter.

But Sophia Sullivan was hopelessly devoted.

After he made an excuse to leave, she desperately tried to justify his behavior.

Isabella said nothing.

Her heart ached.

It ached for her daughter's compromises.

It ached even more for her lack of respect.

If a man doesn't respect your parents.

How much can he truly respect you?

She had arrived that day full of joy.

She left deeply worried.

She could have broken the truth down for Sophia.

She could have even insisted they break up.

But Isabella didn't.

She knew that unless Sophia saw it through.

She would always hold a grudge, given her personality.

Children grow up. You have to learn to let go.

Let her find her own way.

But that act of letting go.

Resulted in news of her abandoning the combined Master's and Ph.D. program.

The cost was too high.

Fortunately, it was all in the past.

Sophia was starting a new life now.

If you feel even a shred of remorse.

Please, do not disturb her again.

Isabella's tone was gentle.

Her words were cruel.

Ethan swayed slightly.

Auntie...

David Sullivan came out upon hearing the commotion.

His expression turned cold.

What are you doing here?

Uncle...

Ethan tried to speak.

David waved his hand to cut him off.

Since it's over.

Let's go our separate ways.

Wish each other well.

Please leave.

Their words were identical.

Ethan lowered his gaze.

His lips pressed into a tight line.

Sorry for disturbing you.

He turned and went downstairs, gifts in hand.

He ran into Alexander Laurent returning from the lab.

Their eyes met.

Alexander's expression remained unchanged.

A storm raged in Ethan's eyes.

As they passed each other.

Ethan heard David's enthusiastic greeting.

Alexander, you're back?

I haven't finished reading the paper you sent.

Thank you.

An electronic copy would have been fine.

Yet you printed and mailed it.

That was very thoughtful.

Alexander's voice was warm.

It was no trouble.

I remembered you preferred reading printed copies.

I wanted to bring it directly.

But Sophia said you had returned home.

It was already printed.

No sense in wasting it.

David nodded repeatedly.

That makes sense.

Such a thick stack would be a shame to waste.

Mm.

By the way, I made ribs today.

Have you eaten? Come join us.

Alexander's lips curved.

Then I won't stand on ceremony.

Why be polite? You're practically family.

Let me go home and drop my things first.

You can drop your things later.

Come in for some tea first. It's freshly brewed.

It's at its best right now.

Any later and it'll be over-steeped.

Alright.

David turned happily and called into the house.

Sophia, Alexander is back.

Wash a cup and come out.

Okay.

The moment Sophia's voice sounded.

Ethan's heart shattered.

Into a million pieces.

David's warmth toward Alexander.

Compared to his cold sharpness toward Ethan.

The contrast was stark.

Ethan didn't hear the rest.

He was already two floors down.

A faint door closing sound echoed.

Probably Alexander entering Sophia's home.

Ethan returned to his Beverly Hills mansion with the ungiven gifts.

Martha had already finished cleaning and left.

The house was empty and silent.

Once again cold and lonely.

He went upstairs to the master bedroom.

The vanity at the foot of the bed had been neglected for a long time.

It held unused skincare products.

Their owner had abandoned them.

Just like she had abandoned him.

Ethan opened the drawer.

It once held a check.

A land deed.

And a diamond bracelet.

Several diamonds formed the Sagittarius constellation.

For Sophia's 22nd birthday.

He had specially commissioned the famous designer John Smith to design it for her.

A symbol of the eternal star in his life.

To surprise her.

Ethan had deliberately picked a fight.

He ignored her calls and blocked her on WeChat.

Until midnight on her birthday.

He appeared at the MIT gate with the bracelet.

To give her the biggest surprise.

But for some reason.

Although she accepted the bracelet.

The misunderstanding was cleared up and they made up.

Ethan felt she wasn't truly happy.

She wore the bracelet a few times after that.

But it seemed cursed.

Every time she wore it, they would have a huge fight.

Later, she locked the bracelet in the drawer.

And never wore it again.

Ethan, I don't want to fight.

I really don't.

After every fight, it feels like our feelings fade.

We drift further apart...

Back then, she sat down to talk seriously.

But he had just come from a gathering that night.

He seemed sober but was actually drunk.

He didn't hear a word she said.

Just mumbled vague agreements.

The next day, when Sophia asked, he was clueless.

For the first time, he saw undisguised disappointment and sorrow in her eyes.

...

Meanwhile, the atmosphere at Sophia's home was warm.

Here, Alexander, try this.

David smiled and picked up a rib for him.

Thank you, Uncle. I can help myself.

How is it? How does it taste?

Delicious.

David's smile widened.

Then have some more.

Alright.

After eating, let's play a game of chess.

Uh...

We can play a game.

But can we not call each other 'bros'?

Alexander ate his food with a wry smile.

After the meal, David set up the chessboard early.

Waiting for Alexander to play with him.

Alexander rolled up his sleeves.

Let me help clean the kitchen first.

David waved his hand.

No need, no need. Sophia will take care of it.

It wasn't that he doted on his daughter.

He had already cleaned up after cooking.

Everything that needed washing was washed. Everything was put away.

Not much was left to do.

Alexander was silent for a moment.

I ate too much. I need to move around.

I'll help clean up first, then play.

David didn't overthink it.

Is that so? Then thank you for your hard work.

It's no trouble.

Alexander carried the dishes into the kitchen.

Sophia was tying her apron.

Her hands reached behind her back, movements stiff.

She seemed to be having trouble.

Alexander spoke up at the right moment.

Need some help?

Sophia paused.

Sorry, Professor. My hands are oily, I don't want to get it on the...

No wonder her movements were so awkward.

Let me.

Alexander picked up the two straps.

He tied a knot deftly.

As he tightened it, both straps cinched inward.

The girl's waistline was instantly accentuated.

So slender...

Alexander wondered if his hands could span it completely.
###Chapter 247

This was Sophia Sullivan's revenge.

"Professor, are you done?"

Sophia's voice snapped Alexander Laurent back to reality.

He flinched and averted his gaze.

"Done."

"Thank you."

Alexander couldn't help but glance at her waist again.

It wasn't for any inappropriate reason.

It was just...

She was so thin.

Did she ever eat?

...

Ethan Roscente sat at his vanity.

From dawn till dusk.

And into the next day's first light.

He wasn't refusing to sleep.

He simply couldn't.

Memories flooded him like a relentless tide.

There were sweet moments from the past.

And moments where he was a complete jerk.

Only when the morning sun was fully bright did he finally break free from the memories.

8 AM.

Rush hour.

He changed his clothes.

Drove to the bakery on Westbrook Road.

A trip that usually took thirty minutes.

Took an hour today.

"One mango mille-feuille, please."

The clerk paused. "Whole cake or slices?"

"Whole."

"You're in luck. It just came out of the oven. Two minutes later and we'd be slicing it."

Ethan gave a slight nod.

The clerk boxed it up, making small talk. "Buying cake this early?"

"My ex-girlfriend liked it."

Seven words.

The clerk's mind instantly conjured a dramatic soap opera.

Ethan took the cake.

Turned and left.

The clerk watched his sports car drive away.

Tsk.

Even more like a TV drama.

...

Morning classes ended.

Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence headed to the lab.

Walking out of the lecture hall, Hannah smacked her lips. "So thirsty."

Marcus stayed silent.

Hannah continued, undeterred. "Let's grab a drink before the lab? My treat!"

Marcus was quiet.

"Don't want one."

"Marcus, you're such a buzzkill!"

"I can go with you."

"No! You have to pick something!"

"I'm on a fitness plan."

"Get zero-calorie sweetener!"

"It's all fake."

"Could you stop talking about weight? You're skinny, big deal!"

"Then why don't you lose weight?"

"Losing weight means no eating or drinking. No eating or drinking means no happiness. No happiness means death. So losing weight equals death. You think I dare?"

Marcus had no retort.

"So, are you drinking or not? If not, I won't invite you next time!"

Marcus sighed. "Let's go."

Hannah's eyes lit up. "You'll have something?"

"I'll have something."

Hannah grinned.

Her dimples showing.

She linked arms with Marcus and pulled him along.

Marcus tried to free his arm.

Hannah held on tighter. "Don't be shy! We're besties!"

Marcus: "..."

How was she so strong?

They had just exited the campus gates.

They saw Ethan get out of his sports car.

Holding the cake box.

Hannah was puzzled. "Why does he always park right at the school entrance?"

Marcus pondered. "Probably thinks it looks cool."

"Cool how?"

"Not sure."

"What kind of car does your family think is cool?"

"Lincoln."

"Mine likes Lexus."

So—

"Why is he driving a Porsche?"

They looked at each other.

Neither understood.

But...

Hannah swallowed. "That cake looks really good."

Marcus was speechless.

Ethan saw them.

He walked straight over. "Where's Sophia?"

Hannah answered honestly. "She took the day off."

"Why?"

"Don't know."

Hannah pulled Marcus away. "We have to go."

Ethan stood there.

In his tailored suit, holding a cartoon-decorated cake.

Amid the bustling crowd at the school gate.

He looked like a complete joke.

Perhaps.

This was Sophia Sullivan's revenge.

He let out a cold laugh.

Walked toward the trash can.

"Hey—"

Ethan turned.

Fiona Valentine smiled at him. "Throwing something away again?"

"None of your business."

"Flowers last time, cake this time. What's next?"

The man frowned.

Fiona continued, "I picked up the flowers last time. Put them in water bottles. Shared them with the dorm next door. They even bought me bubble tea."

Ethan was surprised. "You actually took them?"

"Of course. You're not asking for payment now, are you? You said you didn't want them."

Ethan was speechless.

"What a coincidence running into you again. How about giving me the cake?"

"Going to share it with others again?"

"Sure! It's too big for me alone. No fridge. If I share, maybe I'll get more bubble tea."

"Can't you afford your own bubble tea?"

"Bubble tea someone else buys always tastes better."

"Because it's free?"

"Mhmm." She nodded.

Ethan laughed.

Handed her the cake.

Fiona blinked.

"You don't want it?"

"Want it! Want it! Want it!" She took the cake.

Her smile was radiant.
###Chapter 248

Fiona Valentine watched the man walk away.

Only then did she notice his Porsche.

He wore an Armani suit.

A Patek Philippe glinted coldly on his wrist.

She looked down at the cake in her hand.

Her expression grew complicated.

Sophia Sullivan didn't go to school today.

She was out shopping with her mother.

She had asked her professor for permission in advance.

Today's class was mainly group project presentations.

Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence could handle it.

The professor approved readily.

The book signing was tomorrow.

Isabella Sullivan rarely attended such formal events.

She spent a long time choosing an outfit in front of her closet.

Nothing felt quite right.

The clothes were wearable.

But something was missing.

David Sullivan looked sincere.

"My wife looks beautiful in anything."

Isabella didn't laugh this time.

Sophia understood immediately.

"Mom, let's go buy something new!"

"Kyoto has so many malls. We'll find the perfect outfit."

Isabella's eyes lit up.

"Great idea!"

David scratched his head in confusion.

His flattery had actually failed.

At the SKP mall.

The family of three stepped into the glass elevator.

The elevator ascended slowly.

The luxury stores on the first floor grew smaller.

The entire mall layout came into view.

Isabella couldn't help gasping.

"This mall is enormous!"

The clothing section was on the second and third floors.

But they had pressed the button too late.

The elevator went straight to the fourth floor.

Isabella was drawn to a book display poster in the distance.

They decided to get off on this floor.

A sign above the store read: SKP Rendez-vous.
###Chapter 249
Sylvia Laurent walked over to Isabella Sullivan.

Her gaze fell on the dress Isabella was wearing.

"That dress suits you perfectly."

The sales associate stood nearby, looking surprised.

Sylvia had tried this same dress on herself.

It looked decent.

But it looked even better on Isabella.

It wasn't just the fit.

It was more about the matching aura.

Sylvia's presence was sharper.

Isabella's was much softer.

Her features were gentle.

Her smile was even gentler.

Her eyes and brows relaxed.

It was pleasing to look at.

Sylvia usually didn't care for gentle, feminine types.

Like Olivia Lopez.

Or Professor Eleanor Watson in her qipao.

But Isabella was somehow agreeable to her.

The sales associate seemed hesitant to speak.

Isabella was perceptive.

She understood quickly.

She smiled graciously.

"Thank you." She pointed to another dress. "You have a classic figure. This style would suit you better."

Sylvia had an hourglass shape.

Fuller on top.

A slim waist.

Styles that accentuated the waistline were best.

The one she had on didn't define her waist.

It looked bulky.

The one Isabella indicated was black.

Slimming.

The cut emphasized the waist.

A fishtail, high-waist design.

It added a touch of laziness

Softening the severity of the black.

Sylvia tried it on.

The effect was unexpected.

The reflection in the mirror surprised her.

"You have a great eye. Did you study fashion?"

Isabella shook her head.

"No, I just enjoy reading style magazines."

"Just reading does that?"

"You have to practice a lot too…"

They chatted as they walked.

While the associate rang up the purchase.

Sylvia noticed a novel in Isabella's bag.

The cover looked familiar.

"Are you reading 'Seven-Day Tale'?"

" 'Also'?" Isabella was surprised. "You read it too?"

"Not me, my youngest son. He's obsessed with mystery thrillers lately. Read 'Seven-Day Tale', bought other books by the same author… 'The Weapon', 'The Deserted Village School', things like that…"

"Oh right, he even read the author's young adult romance. Last time I brought him lunch, I flipped through a couple pages. Almost died from the cringe…"

Isabella: "…"

Her embarrassing past was suddenly exposed.

Only awkwardness and mortification remained.

She wanted to curl her toes.

Wanted to vanish on the spot.

Sylvia: "But that author is no good at young adult romance. Their mystery novels are decent though. So popular, market-tested, probably not bad."

Isabella: "…"

The associate finished the transaction.

Smiled as she handed back the credit card and the clothes.

Sylvia took them.

Said goodbye to Isabella.

Reached the entrance.

Bumped right into Sophia Sullivan.

Their eyes met.

They recognized each other.

But neither offered a greeting.

Sophia remembered this wealthy lady.

The other might not remember her.

Initiating conversation might seem calculated.

They'd met a few times.

She could sense the other woman didn't like her.

Since there was no connection.

Better to pretend not to know each other.

Sylvia frowned.

This girl's face was unappealing.

And she had no manners.

They passed each other.

Sylvia walked away.

"Sophia, where did you go? Come quick, I've picked something out." Isabella called to her.

"That fast? I just went to the restroom, missed you trying things on…"

"I'll try it on for you back home."

"Okay."

Isabella: "Just met an older sister, helped her pick a dress. She said her son is reading 'Seven-Day Tale'…"

In the laboratory.

Alexander Laurent sneezed several times in a row.

Quincy Evans grinned mischievously.

"Alex, all those sneezes. How many women are thinking about you?"

Alexander: "… Don't you have work to do?"

Quincy's scalp prickled.

A bad feeling settled in.

"Tomorrow's academic exchange at the Ritz-Carlton. You're going."

"!" Help!

Zoe Langley stifled a laugh.

"Serves you right! Can't resist poking the bear!"

…

The family of three shopped until six in the evening.

Decided to eat at the mall.

Mother and daughter discussed what to have.

David Sullivan suddenly called.

He said he'd booked a restaurant.

Told them to go directly to the lower level.

Isabella: "… How can we let you treat us?"

"I invited you to Kyoto for the book signing. Food, lodging, transportation—it's all on me. Just a meal, and I'm still coming out ahead!" David's voice was hearty.

Considering Isabella preferred lighter flavors.

David had chosen a private kitchen bistro.

Popular with locals and visitors alike.

Business was booming.

Reservations were required.

Knowing they were shopping.

David had specifically booked a private room.

The floor-to-ceiling window overlooked Antique Street.

A newly developed hotspot for social media.

It had a vibe of viewing the bustling city from a quiet hill.

David thoughtfully asked about everyone's preferences.

Expertly ordered dishes and checked on the food.

Not overly effusive.

Just the right amount of hospitality.

Even Sophia had to admit.

David knew how to handle people.

Isabella, needless to say.

A talented horse meeting a discerning judge.

They conversed happily.

Even discussed outlines for new books.

Sophia looked at her mother.

Saw she was in a completely different state.

Before, calls with her editor were either arguments or shouts.

Mentioning new books always brought fatigue.

Now her eyes sparkled.

Full of drive and energy.

She knew these changes were thanks to David.

And David was introduced by Julian Winston…

Mother and daughter went to the restroom.

Isabella suddenly sighed with feeling.

"We should thank that friend who introduced Editor David to you. Without him, there'd be no me as I am now, no 'Seven-Day Tale'. Find time to treat him to a meal? The whole family, to thank him properly."

"Okay." Sophia nodded.

…

The next day.

The book signing event commenced as scheduled.
###Chapter 250

The third floor of Kinokuniya Books was buzzing with noise and excitement.

The book signing hadn't even started yet, but readers already packed the hallway.

Security guards linked arms to form a human barricade.

A giant display stand stood at the entrance, with copies of "Seven-Day Talk" piled high like a small mountain.

Next to it was a life-size cardboard cutout, featuring the book's cover art intertwined with cartoon character designs.

"Oh my god—" a young girl gasped sharply.

Her boyfriend trailed behind her and let out a curse.

"It's just a book signing. How is it more chaotic than a top-tier concert?"

The girl was a seasoned idol chaser, switching her favorite celebrity monthly and hopping between new crushes daily, but she had never followed a novelist before.

Last week, she randomly picked up a suspense novel her father had left on the coffee table. Its cover was eerie and ominous.

With her phone in for repairs, she was bored and picked up the book out of curiosity.

She was completely hooked from that moment on.

When she retrieved her phone that afternoon, she didn't even touch it.

She stayed up all night to finish the book and immediately searched for the author online, but found very little information.

She texted her boyfriend in frustration: Is this author a caveman? She doesn't even have social media!

Unyielding, she dug up Isabella Sullivan's earlier works.

She expected a decade-old novel to be cliché and outdated.

To her surprise—

She was deeply captivated once again!

She spent a week devouring all of Isabella's suspense novels. Apart from that one terribly clichéd youth campus story, every other book was absolutely brilliant.

The writing from ten years ago still felt sharp as a knife, cutting straight to the dark underbelly of society.

A book of that nature would never get published today.

Yet it was written a decade ago!

She wrote fearlessly about everything, laying bare the complexities of human nature with raw honesty.

She learned about the signing while frantically trying to snag tickets for her idol's fan meet.

After two days of internal struggle, she finally chose the book signing.

But the moment she arrived at the bookstore, she regretted it.

Her boyfriend delivered his classic line: "Well, we're already here."

They decided to just go upstairs, take a quick look, and then leave.

But then…

"My support sign! Get it out now!"

Her boyfriend was stunned. "Didn't you throw it in the trash downstairs?"

"Go fish it out!"

"I thought we were going to Ethan Roscente's meet and greet?"

"Not anymore! What kind of turnout does a minor celeb have? I love a big, lively crowd!"

"...Women are so unpredictable."

"Hurry up!"

By the time her boyfriend retrieved the sign, the event was starting.

The girl charged to the front, sign held high.

She suddenly screeched to a halt.

The front rows were filled exclusively with uncles and aunts.

"What's going on?"

Her boyfriend blurted out, "Why is it all older people?"

This instantly provoked outrage—

"What's wrong with older people? Are we in your way?"

Her boyfriend tried to explain. "Aren't you a bit old for this sort of thing?"

"We're here for the books! Got a problem with that?"

"Exactly!"

Her boyfriend was dumbfounded. "Isabella Sullivan's reader base is this diverse?"

"Hmph! We've been fans for ten years. We got busy with marriage, kids, and careers. We might not be online voting, but we support her by buying her books with real money."

"We were just busy, not gone!"

The girl looked around. The readers indeed spanned a wide age range.

The host took the stage to warm up the crowd.

Isabella Sullivan made her appearance amidst applause.

"Wow—"

"Professor Sullivan is this beautiful?"

"Incredible! The author of horror novels is a stunning beauty!"

Isabella wore a simple black dress with a white chiffon scarf tied at her waist. Her steps were light, making the sheer fabric sway gracefully.

"Hello everyone, I'm Isabella Sullivan. Thank you all for coming…"

She bowed deeply.

Sincerity is always moving.

Thunderous applause erupted.

Sophia Sullivan stood in the crowd, watching her radiant mother on stage, a smile touching her lips.

After the Q&A session, the signing officially began.

The crowd surged forward.

Sophia was pushed along by the flow of people. She tried to step aside, but a sudden force shoved her from behind.

She lost her balance and stumbled forward.

Just as she was about to fall, a pair of hands caught her by the waist, steadying her securely.

"Thank— Professor Laurent?" Sophia's eyes widened. "What are you doing here?"

Alexander Laurent cleared his throat softly and withdrew his hands.

The sensation of her slender waist lingered on his fingertips.

He bent down to pick up the book that had fallen to the floor. The title "Seven-Day Talk" was prominently displayed on the cover.

"I came for the book signing."

"You read my mother's books?"

"Yes."

Sophia looked perplexed. "If you wanted her signature, you could have just asked me. Why bother with this crowd?"

"It holds a different meaning this way."

"What differ—"

Before she could finish, the crowd surged again.

Sophia was shoved forward, her face crashing directly into the man's chest.

The warmth of his body seeped through his shirt. She froze instantly.

Alexander's entire body tensed.

The woman was right there in his arms. A simple lift of his arms would pull her completely against him.

Her soft breaths ghosted near his collarbone. His own heart was pounding violently in his ears.

Sophia's breath hitched.

She hurriedly tried to step back, but someone pushed her again.

She collided with his chest once more, this time pressed even tighter against him.

"Sorry, Professor, I…" It wasn't on purpose!
###Chapter 251

This was so embarrassing.

Alexander Laurent shielded her as they pushed through the crowd.

Finally, she could breathe fresh air.

Sophia Sullivan sighed in relief.

She looked up and met the man's amused eyes.

"Professor... I'm sorry..."

Alexander pointed to the side of her face. "Your hair is stuck."

"...What?"

Sophia reached up to feel.

She couldn't find the right spot.

Alexander gently brushed it aside for her.

His fingertips grazed her soft skin.

His movements paused slightly. "There."

Sophia tucked the strand behind her ear.

It was all because the venue was so crowded.

Sweat had made her hair stick to her face.

How mortifying.

Remembering how she had crashed into his chest.

Sophia's cheeks burned.

Her heart raced.

She couldn't stay here any longer.

"Professor! I'm going to buy water!"

She turned and ran before he could respond.

She ducked into the elevator.

Sophia ran down to the first floor.

She looked back and didn't see him.

Only then did she relax.

Turning around, she nearly bumped into Sebastian Evans.

He was accompanied by two elderly people.

The old gentleman had snow-white hair.

Deep wrinkles were etched between his brows.

He looked stern and imposing.

The old lady had a softer expression.

But her eyes seemed vacant and unfocused.

She walked slowly with a cane.

Noticing Sophia's gaze.

The old lady turned her head blankly.

She soon looked away.

Sebastian was surprised.

He was specifically accompanying his grandparents on a walk today.

They had just returned from abroad.

His grandmother had been hospitalized due to acclimation issues.

They were passing by after her discharge today.

She suddenly wanted to visit the bookstore.

He hadn't expected to run into Sophia here.

Remembering Isabella Sullivan's book signing.

It was indeed today.

Her presence here made sense.

They exchanged brief greetings.

Sebastian introduced his grandparents.

Isaac Atlante studied the young woman before him.

Most young people these days pursued extreme thinness.

This girl was different.

Her face was round and her complexion glowed.

Her figure was proportionate and healthy.

A high ponytail looked fresh and neat.

Her eyes were especially bright.

They curved like crescents when she smiled.

They reminded him of another pair of eyes.

Sophia greeted them politely.

The old gentleman rarely showed a smile.

Sebastian was inwardly astonished.

His grandfather was usually very serious.

He seldom showed such kindness to younger people.

According to the old family servants.

His grandparents used to have cheerful personalities.

Everything changed after their second daughter went missing.

They now lived abroad long-term.

Largely because of that reason.

Thinking of his missing aunt.

Sebastian looked at his grandparents.

This regret was likely irreparable.

"A-Seb, I'm thirsty." The old lady suddenly spoke.

"I'll buy water." Sebastian looked at Sophia. "Could you stay with them for a bit?"

"Should I go buy it?"

"Grandmother only drinks a specific brand. I need to go to the supermarket across the street."

"I'll wait here with them then."

"Thank you."

Sebastian quickly left.

Florence Atlante pulled Sophia to sit down.

"Good child, how do you know A-Seb?"

"Through a friend."

Ethan Roscente counted as that friend.

"He rarely makes female friends. You're the first!"

Sophia thought to herself.

You just haven't seen how quickly he cycles through girlfriends.

"Things have changed so much..." the old gentleman mused.

Sophia detected a note of nostalgia.

She spoke about the recent changes in Kyoto.

Isaac listened attentively.

"Are you from here?"

"I grew up in Lin City."

She described the scenery of Lin City.

The old gentleman's memory gradually sharpened.

"Lin City... I've been there before..."

As the head of the Atlante family.

Younger generations were usually nervous around him.

But Sophia was natural and poised.

"How old are you, young lady?" Florence suddenly asked.

Sophia answered truthfully.

The old lady asked about her family and work.

Sophia remained polite.

But didn't reveal too much.

Isaac was somewhat surprised.

His wife was unusually talkative today.

Florence sensed her wariness.

She explained with a smile.

"Your voice sounds very familiar, like I've heard it somewhere before... Don't mind my questions."

Sophia realized the old lady's eyesight was poor.

People appeared as blurry outlines to her.

She could only grasp general shapes.

Even though she couldn't see features clearly.

The voice felt familiar.

She felt an unconscious sense of closeness.

That's why she asked a few more questions.
###Chapter 252
Sophia Sullivan's cheeks warmed.

Her little scheme had been seen through.

But she didn't feel embarrassed.

It was only natural to be cautious when meeting someone for the first time.

The two elders, with their wealth of experience, would surely understand.

Florence Atlante gently patted the back of her hand. "It's good for a girl, especially a pretty one like you, to be careful. Better safe than sorry."

"You're absolutely right."

"You said my voice sounds familiar... I grew up in the neighboring city. I only came to Kyoto after high school. We shouldn't have met before."

"Right." Florence Atlante smiled.

Yet, Sophia detected a trace of disappointment in that smile.

Isaac Atlante spoke up, breaking the subtle tension. "Haven't met before? Well, meeting now is fate."

Sophia nodded with a smile.

Sebastian Evans returned with water, handing two bottles to the elders.

The rest, still in the bag, he thrust toward Sophia.

"These are for your aunt and uncle. Your aunt had a signing today, so your uncle must be here too, right?"

"Yes, he's here." Sophia hesitated, unsure whether to take it.

"Take it." Sebastian pushed it directly into her hands.

"...Thank you."

Sebastian's gaze swept over the elders. "What were you all talking about? You looked so happy."

He had seen his grandfather beaming and even his usually stern grandmother smiling slightly before he entered.

Sebastian was taken aback.

How long had it been since he'd seen them laugh like that?

Last year, when he visited them abroad, his grandmother was in the hospital, and his grandfather was worried sick.

He stayed for two weeks and never once saw his grandfather smile.

He had tried to persuade them to return home.

The Atlante family's roots were all here.

The environment at home was better for their retirement.

Better than growing old and frail in a foreign land.

But his pleas had fallen on deaf ears.

Years ago, investigators brought news that Emilia Atlante might have been taken to Europe.

For this single, unverified lead, the two had searched across Europe for nearly a decade.

If not for his grandmother's failing health, they would never have come back.

All these years, Sebastian watched, anxious and helpless.

He couldn't even make them a little happier...

But Sophia Sullivan had made them laugh.

"Thank you for looking after my grandparents."

Sophia waved her hand. "Don't mention it. The signing is almost over. Since you're back, I should head upstairs."

She said goodbye to the two elders.

Isaac Atlante and Florence Atlante watched her enter the elevator, only then learning about the novel signing on the third floor.

Sebastian briefly introduced the recently popular suspense novel, "The Seven-Day Talk."

Florence's heart stirred.

She remembered Minmin always declaring she wanted to be a writer when she was little, to write amazing stories.

Memories surfaced, her daughter's voice and smile as vivid as yesterday...

She suddenly wanted to go up and see this author, to see if her eyes also shone when she talked about her novels.

But the moment she voiced this thought, Isaac stopped her.

"Your eyes aren't well. You've been out too long today. It's time to go home."

Remembering her physical condition, Florence could only sigh and give up.

...

On the third floor, Alexander Laurent stood by the elevator, about to go down and look for her.

Ding—

The metal doors opened.

Sophia stepped out.

"Professor."

"Where did you go?"

They spoke simultaneously, but their moods were completely different.

Sophia was relaxed and at ease. Alexander could not conceal his anxiety, beneath which lay clear concern.

"I ran into Sebastian Evans downstairs. It took a moment. Professor, some water."

Sophia took a bottle from the bag and offered it to him.

Alexander glanced at the bag's logo. It was from the import supermarket across the street. Sophia wouldn't have gone that far. It could only be...

"Sebastian bought this?"

"Yes. I watched his grandparents while he went to buy water. The elders only recognize this brand."

Alexander reached out and took it.

Sophia looked toward the venue. "Is it over?"

Alexander shook his head. "Still signing. The line is long. It might take a while longer."

The memory of her earlier embarrassment was still fresh. She had no desire to go back into that crowd.

But...

Sophia looked at the book in the man's hand. "Professor, are you going to queue for a signature?"

"I'll wait until the end. No need to crowd them."

"Okay!" Sophia nodded repeatedly. Perfect!

The man chuckled softly.

Sophia: "Professor, what are you laughing at?"

"Ahem!" He cleared his throat lightly, suddenly turning serious. "Nothing."

"...?" She felt he was lying, but she had no proof!

The signing, scheduled to end at four, dragged on until five.

Alexander and Sophia were last in line. He opened the book and placed it before Isabella Sullivan.

"Sorry to trouble you, Mom. A personalized inscription, please~"

"Thank you, Auntie."

Isabella looked up. Her daughter stood before her, smiling, with Alexander Laurent beside her.

Both looked at her, full of expectation.

For a moment, Isabella was dazed. A young couple, a perfect match...

She dismissed the unrealistic thought and picked up her pen.

For Sophia, she wrote:

I will mount a long wind some day and break the heavy waves, and set my cloudy sail straight and bridge the deep, deep sea.

For Alexander Laurent:

I must reach the mountain's crest; it dwarfs all peaks under my feet.

After it was over, Alexander suggested going for a meal.

David Sullivan objected. "How can we let you do that? If anyone's treating, it should be us!"

Alexander shook the book in his hand. "A specially personalized inscription from the author herself. Isn't that worth a meal?"

David was speechless.

Was it worth it?

Of course it was!

Alexander first asked Isabella what she wanted to eat. Isabella said she didn't mind.

He asked David.

"I'm not picky. Let Sophia decide."

Alexander naturally turned his gaze to the girl.

Sophia thought for a moment. "...How about hot pot?"

All three had no objections.

On the way—

Sophia looked at her phone and suddenly gasped.

David: "What's wrong?"

"That hot pot place is too popular. There are 82 parties ahead of us. We'd have to wait forever if we go now..."

Isabella: "Shall we choose another place?"

Sophia: "But this one is really good. Authentic beef tallow broth. They say it's incredibly fragrant."

As for who said it...

No one else but her foodie friend, Hannah Morse.

Alexander was driving, eyes on the road. He chuckled. "No need to change. I already reserved a table."

Sophia: "Great!"

Several minutes later, she belatedly realized—

Wasn't this decided on the spur of the moment?

How did he reserve a table in advance?

And, out of all the hot pot places, how did he know she wanted this one?

Sophia gazed at the man's profile, lost in thought.
###Chapter 253

The server led the four of them into a private room.

The broth boiled.
Dishes were placed into the pot.

The restaurant Hannah recommended was indeed good.
The flavors were fresh and fragrant.
The spice was exhilarating.

Sophia Sullivan went to the restroom midway.

When she returned, there was an extra bowl of Aiyu Jelly on the table.

Alexander Laurent pushed it towards her.
"It's cold. It will help with the spice."

She thanked him with a smile, feeling warmth in her heart.

The professor was so thoughtful.

When the bill came, Alexander stood and went out.

Next to the hot pot restaurant was a night market, bustling with noise and excitement.

Isabella Sullivan pulled David Sullivan away to explore.

Sophia stayed by the entrance, waiting for Alexander.

He returned quickly, holding a paper bag.
"I packed some cantaloupe. You like it. Finish it tonight, don't leave it overnight."

"Okay," she nodded.

"Where are your parents?"

She pointed towards the night market.

"Shall we go take a look too?"

"Sure!" Her eyes lit up.

They walked side by side into the night market.

Stalls lined the streets, filled with a dazzling array of goods.

Passing by an accessories stall, Sophia stopped.

She pointed to a gray claw clip.
"How much is this?"

"Ten dollars."

"How do you clip it to make it hold well?"

The stall owner demonstrated on the spot.

The motion was too fast. Sophia didn't catch it.

A new customer approached. The owner turned to greet them.

Just as Sophia was about to give up, Alexander had already paid.

He picked up the claw clip, the corner of his mouth lifting slightly.
"Turn around."

"Huh?"

"I'll clip it for you."

She turned around in a daze.

The man's hands gathered her long hair.

His fingertips were warm. His movements were gentle.

Her hair was softly gathered up.

The pads of his fingers brushed against her neck. Sophia's heart skipped a beat.

"Professor..."

She instinctively tried to move away.

"Don't move. It'll be done soon."

The claw clip held her hair securely in place.

"Done."

She shook her head. It was really secure.

The stall owner laughed teasingly.
"Your boyfriend learns fast! He clips it better than I do."

Alexander's lips curved into a smile.

Sophia hurried to explain, "He's not—"

The owner cut her off.
"In ancient times, a husband styling his wife's hair symbolized growing old together. Not many men are willing to do that these days!"

Sophia tried again. "He's actually—"

The owner patted the back of her hand.
"Treasure him, young lady!"

Sophia completely gave up on explaining.

They left the stall.

Alexander suddenly asked, "Did you learn it?"

"...Learn what?"

"Styling hair."

Sophia was silent.

She hadn't seen the process at all.

"Should I teach you again?"

"No need." She waved her hands repeatedly.

Since she couldn't learn it anyway, she might as well accept defeat.

Alexander chuckled softly.
"You don't trust me?"

"I don't trust myself," she sighed.

They reached the end of the street and ran into Isabella and David.

"Mom—"

Isabella immediately noticed her hair.
"That clip is quite pretty. Did you do it yourself?"

Sophia gave a vague assent.

"Definitely not!" Isabella saw right through her.
"You've never known how to style your hair since you were little."

Sophia's ears burned.

"The owner helped you, right?"

She nodded quickly.

Alexander stood to the side, smiling without a word.

David nudged his shoulder.
"Alex, what are you smiling about?"

Alexander touched his chin.
"Was I?"

"You were definitely smiling just now!" David leaned closer.
"Thinking of something good?"

"Perhaps." Alexander's gaze shifted slightly.

David chuckled.
"I get it! I remember your aunt often has that silly smile too."

He lowered his voice.
"Alex, why haven't you found a girlfriend yet? Too busy with work?"

"Should I ask your aunt to introduce someone? The new female teachers at the school are all quite nice..."

Alexander cleared his throat lightly.
"That won't be necessary."

"Don't be shy!"
###Chapter 254

Really, it's not necessary.

Alexander Laurent paused.

I already have someone I like.

What?!

David Sullivan's eyes instantly lit up.

Really? Did you confess? Why aren't you together yet?

The rapid-fire questions.

Alexander fell silent.

He regretted answering.

The four parted ways at their doorsteps.

Alexander turned left.

He opened his door and went inside.

The family of three turned right.

Isabella smiled and thanked him.

"You spent too much today, Alexander."

"You're too kind, Auntie."

"I got your signed book today."

"I'm the one who benefited."

His words made Isabella beam with delight.

Sophia went to take a shower.

As usual, she gathered her hair.

She put on a shower cap.

To keep her hair from getting wet.

Her hand reached behind her.

She only felt the claw clip.

She belatedly realized her hair was already up.

She looked at herself in the mirror.

She shook her head vigorously.

The clip didn't budge.

Ouch—

That technique is impressive.

But why can't I do it myself?

It doesn't make sense.

It's not scientific.

So annoying!

Isabella and David finished washing up.

They had already gone back to their room and lay down.

The couple talked with the light on.

A message from Stone Macmillan arrived then.

"Professor Isabella, congratulations!"

"'Seven Days Talk' broke sales records again today."

"Several production companies contacted me."

"They want to buy the film and TV adaptation rights."

"I got a call from the publisher thirty minutes ago."

"The first print run is already sold out."

"The factory is working overnight on a second print."

"Your second royalty payment has also arrived."

"I'll transfer it to you shortly."

"I wanted to call."

"But you might be resting at this hour."

"Texting seemed better."

"We can also talk tomorrow."

"But I'm just too excited hhhhh."

Isabella finished reading.

She happily hugged her husband.

David was stunned.

Happiness came too suddenly.

His phone dinged.

A bank transfer notification.

Isabella opened it.

This time it was over three hundred thousand!

How long has it been since the last payment?

And already another several hundred thousand?

This is just the physical book sales royalty.

From what Stone said.

There will be copyright fees later.

"Honey, we have money now!"

It's not that I have money.

But that we have money.

At that moment.

David's eyes and nose stung.

"I'm sorry, Isabella, I…"

"What do you want to say?"

Isabella's smile faded.

"At such a happy time."

"You're not going to get sentimental, are you?"

"Say something useless like 'I'm sorry'?"

David shook his head frantically.

"Of course not! Am I that kind of person?"

"Then why did you say you're sorry?"

"I meant to say."

"Sorry."

"I'll be living off you from now on."

"So happy! Hehe!"

"If Old Xie finds out."

"He'll be green with envy."

"Haha—"

Professor Xie, far away in another city, sneezed repeatedly.

"Caught a cold?"

Isabella laughed.

"That's more like it."

"You absolutely cannot do that."

"Earning less money is no excuse for insecurity or bad temper."

"Only pathetic men get jealous and insecure."

"Normal people would be overjoyed!"

David nodded like a mighty warrior pecking rice.

"Exactly! Exactly!"

"Only fools get jealous."

"If my wife does well."

"Her husband benefits too."

"What is there to be insecure about?"

They had previously said they would thank Julian Winston with a meal.

Now that the book signing was successfully concluded.

Isabella had some free time.

She told Sophia to arrange it quickly.

The location was set at a seafood restaurant.

Near SKP.

It had limited daily supply.

The per-customer price was terrifyingly high.

Sophia only managed to get a reservation two days in advance.

Isabella's original words were.

If you don't know what to eat.

Then choose the most expensive.

Price doesn't represent everything.

But it at least shows sincerity.

Sure enough.

Julian raised an eyebrow when he heard the restaurant's name.

But then he thought about it and it wasn't surprising.

Since it was a thank-you meal.

This dinner naturally had significant weight.

On Friday evening.

Julian arrived ten minutes early.

Sophia's family was even earlier.

They were already waiting in the private room.

Sophia had originally invited Olivia.

But she was too busy with work.

She had been working overtime for two days straight.

She really had no time.

"Really not coming? Julian is here too."

Olivia rolled her eyes.

She snorted proudly.

"So what if he's there?"

"Do I have to go just because he's there?"

"Aren't you two dating?"

"He can take you home after dinner."

"Pfft."

"Who needs him to take me?"

"I have my own car!"

"We're fake dating."

"You know that."

"Stop teasing me…"

Inside the private room.

Julian greeted them with a smile.

"Uncle, Auntie, you're too kind."

"It was a small favor."

"Was a special thank-you dinner really necessary?"

"Of course it was."

David smiled and shook his hand.

"Thanks to you introducing Editor Stone to Sophia."

"We have 'Seven Days Talk' now."

Isabella nodded beside him with a smile.

The couple was younger than Julian had imagined.

David was tall and broad-shouldered.

Yet he possessed a rare scholarly elegance.

His clothing, demeanor, and way of speaking.

All carried a refined literati air.

Isabella was even more remarkable.

She wore a magnolia-colored cheongsam.

Her long hair was elegantly pinned up with a hair stick.

Standing next to David.

She was graceful, composed, and exceptionally distinguished.

At first glance.

One could believe she was in her thirties or forties.

They took their seats.

The food was quickly served.

David had brought a bottle of fine wine.

After filling the glasses.

He offered the first toast to Julian.

"As the saying goes."

"A drop of kindness should be repaid with a spring."

"I'll finish this glass."

"Thank you for your support, Mr. Winston."

"Please don't…"

Julian quickly raised his glass.

His tone was humble.

"I'm the younger generation."

"You calling me 'Mr. Winston' again and again."

"Isn't that too much honor?"

"Just call me Julian."

"Alright, Julian."

"Then I won't argue with you."

"You're of the same generation as Sophia."

"You don't mind calling me Uncle, do you?"

"Uncle, you're too kind."

"I should be toasting you…"

Julian was accustomed to business dinners and social drinking.

His emotional intelligence and etiquette were both impeccable.

David raised his glass again.

He said with emotion.

"Bai Juyi's poem 'Speaking for the Crane' has a line."

"'Touched by your single glance of favor, I came together with you to the paths of Luoyang.'"

"Everyone says Stone was your Auntie's savior."

"But I think the person who made the connection."

"Also deserves immense credit."

"So this second glass."

"Uncle still must toast you…"

The meal was excellent.

The drinks were satisfying.

Julian rarely encountered such a relaxed dinner.

Apart from the first two glasses.

David didn't push any more drinks after that.

He only said to drink in moderation.

While meeting a知己 calls for a thousand cups.

Health comes first.

Stopping after a taste is also wonderful.

Julian was impressed by his ability to quote poetry at will.

And his manner of citing classics with every sentence.

His eyes filled with admiration.

It couldn't be helped.

We admire what we lack.

His Chinese grades had always been poor since childhood.

So he naturally had a filter for cultured people.

After the meal, as they left the restaurant.

Julian took out his car keys.

Sophia guessed what he was about to say.

She waved her phone.

"No need to specially drive us."

"I already called a car."

"It will be here soon."

Julian chuckled.

He watched the family of three leave.

He watched the ride-share car gradually drive away.

Until it disappeared.

He suddenly sighed.

He really didn't understand.

With in-laws like this.

What more was there to pick?
###Chapter 255

Julian Winston recalled the recent scene of Isabella Langley's mother and her delinquent brother causing a commotion at Ethan Roscente's company.

He let out a soft, derisive snort.

It was fortunate the child was gone.

Otherwise, Mrs. Victoria Roscente would probably have cried herself into a faint.

The designated driver arrived quickly.

He pulled the car door open, ready to get in.

The restaurant manager hurried out after him.

"Sir, a moment please!"

Julian turned back.

The manager handed him a shawl.

"Items left behind in the private room. There's also a brooch. They must belong to one of the ladies..."

Sophia Sullivan and her family had already left.

The manager could only hand them to Julian, who had been at the same dinner.

"I'll take them."

He casually tossed the shawl onto the back seat.

He could just have a courier deliver it to Sophia Sullivan tomorrow.

"Let's go, driver."

On the way, Charlie Lowell called.

"Where are you? Everyone's waiting for you! Don't tell me you're chickening out?"

The background noise was loud and chaotic.

It was either a nightclub or a bar.

"Piss off! I'm almost there!"

Julian got the address.

He instructed the driver to change course and head to Slide Bar & Lounge.

Charlie slung an arm around his shoulders as they entered.

"In such a hurry? Just crawling out of some warm, welcoming bed?"

"A proper dinner. Stop talking nonsense."

Charlie smirked.

"Like I'd believe that."

"I have a girlfriend. Don't start rumors."

"Wasn't it fake?" Charlie said with a teasing grin.

Julian's smile vanished instantly.

"Who said that?"

"Olivia Lopez."

"When?"

Charlie thought for a moment.

"Last weekend, I think. Saw her with some guy at the tennis club. They looked pretty cozy..."

The man was teaching her how to serve, hands-on.

They were practically pressed together.

Charlie had immediately charged over, ready to throw a punch.

But then...

"Turns out you two are just fake dating, each doing your own thing. I almost hurt the wrong guy."

Charlie bumped his shoulder.

"You sure know how to play the game. Finding a shield like Olivia Lopez to deal with your family. Why can't I get that lucky?"

Julian walked into the private booth with a dark expression.

Charlie was baffled.

He was fine a moment ago.

Why the sudden mood swing?

He asked, but Julian just kept drinking.

Ethan Roscente frowned.

"What's his problem?"

Charlie shrugged.

"No idea. He just suddenly got like this."

"Boring." Ethan picked up his jacket. "I'm heading out."

"Don't go, Ethan... Everyone's here..."

Ethan glanced at Julian.

"Not interested in watching someone drown their sorrows."

He stood up.

Julian also set down his glass.

"Really is boring. I'm leaving too."

Charlie looked at the empty booth.

"Wait for me, you two..."

The three of them stood by the roadside waiting for their drivers.

Charlie felt a craving for a cigarette.

He patted his pockets but couldn't find a lighter.

He asked Julian for one.

"Get it yourself from the back seat."

Charlie opened the car door and bent down to search.

"Found it..."

He lit his cigarette and returned the lighter.

His eyes fell on the pale yellow shawl in the back seat.

"Since when do you like doing it in the car?"

Julian frowned.

"Doing what?"

"Isn't this shawl a woman's? Which wildflower left it behind?"

"Stop talking crap. It belongs to Sophia Sullivan's mother. I'm returning it to her tomorrow."

Charlie was surprised.

"Why is something of Sophia's mom's in your car?"

Ethan subtly pricked up his ears.

Julian's eyes shifted.

He deliberately played coy.

"There's a reason, of course..."

Charlie pressed.

"What reason?"

"None of your business."

"How is it none of my business? Sophia even came to visit me at the hospital before. Of course I care about her!"

Julian raised his voice slightly.

He glanced surreptitiously at Ethan.

"Sophia visited you when you were sick?"

Ethan turned slightly, pretending to be casual.

But he was listening intently.

Charlie nodded.

"Sophia was really good to me!"

Julian agreed.

"She is a good person. She even treated me to a seafood feast tonight."

Charlie was even more curious.

"Why treat you? Spit it out!"

Julian raised an eyebrow.

"There's a reason, of course."

Charlie was speechless.

Just then, the drivers arrived.

Julian turned and got into his car.

"I'm off."

Charlie waved dismissively.

But Ethan stared intently at the departing taillights.

Until they disappeared from view.

Why?

She was in close contact with Sebastian Evans.

She took the initiative to visit Charlie.

She could even have a meal with Julian and her family.

Yet she refused to spare him so much as an extra glance?

"Ethan?"

Charlie called his name several times.

Ethan snapped back to attention.

"What?"

"I asked where you're going later."

Ethan was silent for a moment.

"Got a cigarette?"

Charlie handed him one.

But then realized he had no light.

He'd just returned the lighter to Julian.

Ethan took the cigarette, rolling it between his fingers.

His gaze was unreadable, shifting between light and shadow.

He suddenly spoke softly.

"Charlie, do you think I was wrong?"
###Chapter 256

Charlie froze.

He was confused.

"Was I wrong to break up with Sophia Sullivan back then?"

Ethan's expression was complicated.

"Ethan, you're only thinking of this now?"

Ethan remained silent.

"Sophia is such a good person. If it were me, I would cherish her."

Charlie suddenly stopped.

He quickly explained.

"I don't mean anything else. Just a hypothetical. If I were you, I would never let go."

Good women are always in demand.

Once you miss your chance, it's hard to turn back.

"On my birthday, Sophia came specifically to celebrate. But you broke up with her in public. I was stunned."

"Julian later told me quietly that you would regret it eventually."

I just didn't expect it to be so soon.

I thought you two would still be entangled.

After all, it's been so many years.

Who knew Sophia would be so determined this time.

"Ethan, I understand how you feel now. But Sophia has already..."

"I know I was wrong. I apologized." Ethan lowered his head, the cigarette in his hand crushed tightly. "But she won't forgive me."

"Charlie, tell me. How can I win her back?"

Charlie was stumped.

He knew Sophia too well.

Winning her back was absolutely impossible.

But how could he say that?

Seeing Ethan so distraught, he couldn't bear to be blunt.

"Ethan, there are plenty of good women. Why not look forward? Maybe there will be a pleasant surprise."

Ethan chuckled softly. The cigarette shattered in his palm, tobacco scattering. "Yes, there are plenty of good women. But Sophia Sullivan, there's only one."

Charlie had nothing to say.

If you knew this would happen, why did you do it in the first place?

"Who's the designated driver for license plate ending 5593?"

"Me!" Charlie responded immediately. "Ethan, I have to go. You..."

He paused.

"Try to think positively."

Charlie got in the car and left.

Ethan stood in place, his eyelids lowered.

The warm yellow light fell on him, yet it emitted a sense of coldness.

...

The next day, the weather was clear.

The sun was warm, and a gentle breeze brushed by.

Last time they visited the Louvre. This time, David Sullivan wanted to tour a garden.

The popular gardens required reservations and weren't suitable for a spontaneous trip.

"...Then let's go to Atlante Gardens!"

Atlante Gardens was rumored to be the private garden of the Atlante family.

It was originally the Ming Dynasty Yong Prince's summer retreat. During the Qing Dynasty, Emperor Qianlong gifted it to Fu Heng, who later gave it to his daughter as a dowry.

After several changes of hands, it was bought by salt merchant Winston Atlante during the Republic of China era and renamed "Atlante Gardens."

Before the war in Peiping, Winston Atlante often brought his family here to escape the summer heat.

After the reform and opening up, the garden was returned to the Atlante descendants.

"...And then?" Isabella listened intently, a thoughtful look in her eyes.

"That's it." Sophia stood before the last information panel.

The panel documented the history of Atlante Gardens.

From ancient times to the modern era, its changes and ownership were described in detail.

Even the successive owners were clearly listed.

Isabella: "Who was the most recent owner?"

Sophia looked again and shook her head. "It doesn't say."

Isabella walked over and stood beside her daughter. "It says it was returned to the Atlante descendants after the reform and opening up. Since it was returned, it should be private property."

If it's private property, why is it open to the public?

And without charging admission, like a charity.

Very strange!

But Isabella didn't dwell on it. The family of three continued east.

The garden was vast. They walked for over ten minutes before reaching the next pavilion.

Next to the pavilion was a small bamboo grove, with a bluestone path winding deep inside.

A winding path leading to a secluded spot.

The wind blew, rustling the bamboo leaves.

The wind carried the scent of bamboo.

The three followed the signs. David Sullivan took pictures as he walked, exclaiming repeatedly—

"So beautiful!"

Passing through a small courtyard and a narrow gate, their view suddenly opened up.

At the end of the flat ground stood an imposing mansion.

Ornate beams and painted rafters, dignified and magnificent.

A plaque hung in the center, with two characters in regular script—Main Hall!

The interior wasn't open; only the exterior could be toured.

Isabella slowly approached, stopping outside the yellow line. Suddenly, fragments flashed through her mind.

Too fast to grasp!

She looked around blankly, the feeling of déjà vu growing stronger.

Had she... been here before?

Sophia was admiring the scenery. She turned and saw Isabella standing still, looking puzzled.

"Mom?" she called. "What's wrong?"

David Sullivan also looked over. "Is the sun too strong? Do you need to rest?"

Isabella smiled and shook her head. "It's nothing. I just think... this place is truly beautiful. It would be so pleasant to live here."

Sophia laughed. "People did live here before. The previous owner lived here long-term with his family. Back then, the garden hadn't been handed over. It was private property; outsiders couldn't enter."

Along the way, Sophia noticed many buildings bore traces of habitation.

Several times, she saw childish graffiti on pillars and railings.

Marked by the erosion of time, left by some innocent child long ago.

But soon, Sophia couldn't smile. On the return trip, they didn't take the original path but chose another route, and then—

They got gloriously lost.

The rockeries and courtyards all looked similar. The bamboo groves and pavilions were also nearly identical.

The signs were gone!

"Mom... I think we took a wrong turn..."

"Wrong? No, I remember the exit is this way..."

Wait!

I remember?

The words slipped out.

Isabella was stunned.

She had never been here before. Why would she remember?

Sophia didn't notice her wording, only wanting to find the way out quickly.

Isabella simply walked ahead, leading the two through twists and turns, miraculously arriving at a small gate.

Outside was the main street!

Just like that... they were out?

Sophia looked at Isabella with surprise and doubt. "Mom..."
###Chapter 257
Irene Valdemar

Isabella Sullivan was born with no sense of direction.

She could get lost not just in a garden, but on any regular street.

"How did you find your way, Mom?"

Isabella was stunned. "I... don't know. My intuition told me to go this way. I tried it and got out..."

David Sullivan grinned. "Trust the wife, live forever!"

Father and daughter simply thought Isabella had gotten lucky.

But Isabella glanced back.

The exquisite garden. The hidden side door.

It felt like it existed in her memory.

...

At the same moment, in the same garden.

Sebastian Evans was taking his grandparents on a nostalgic trip.

Over a decade had passed, but the main house's furnishings remained unchanged.

The elderly couple's eyes shimmered with remembrance.

When they had handed over the garden years ago, they had only one request.

Nothing in the main house was to be moved.

If Emilia ever returned, they didn't want her to be saddened by an unfamiliar place.

Florence Atlante strained to keep her eyes open.

Her mind was filled with images of young Emilia playing.

"Little Emilia is looking at the fishies, picking bamboo leaves, making wine dippers. Who are they for?"

"For Daddy to drink, hee-hee—"

Her daughter's laughter seemed to still ring in her ears.

The memory felt like it was from yesterday.

"Old man, I feel like our daughter has always been right here..." She touched the carvings on the porch column. "Emilia's drawings are still here. They haven't changed at all."

Florence wished so desperately to return to the past.

Given another chance, she would have stayed by her daughter's side.

Never leaving her.

Not letting her out of her sight for a single moment!

Emilia, where are you? Are you doing well? Mommy misses you...

She turned away, secretly wiping her tears.

Isaac Atlante was both angry and heartbroken.

His grief was undiminished, but his voice was firm. "Do you want your eyes or not? We agreed before coming that you wouldn't cry."

Sebastian placed a hand on the old woman's shoulder, speaking gently. "Grandmother, your eyes have just started to improve. Crying will undo all the progress."

"Auntie would be sad to see you like this."

After Emilia's disappearance, the old woman had fallen ill from longing, crying day and night until her eyes were damaged.

They had seen doctors both domestically and abroad, with little effect.

The Western medicine only treated the symptoms, not the root cause.

The traditional Chinese doctor felt her pulse and prescribed medicine, shaking his head with a sigh: Emotional wounds require emotional healing. No medicine can withstand constant weeping.

The eye damage was superficial; the real harm was to her liver and spleen.

"Alright, I won't cry." Florence wiped her tears and took a deep breath.

Sebastian was right. If her eyes were ruined, how would she see her daughter when she returned?

The old man smiled. "That's more like it. Remember when Emilia was little and would cry, your eyes would get red, which only made her cry harder."

"I remember. You were always so strict with her, constantly criticizing and lecturing."

After searching for so many years, everyone around the old couple advised them to give up.

Someone being missing for so long without a trace spoke volumes.

Emilia was twenty-two when she disappeared. Even if she had no choice then, after over twenty years, if she were alive, she would have found a way to contact her parents.

But there was nothing. Not a single phone call. Not a single message.

The old couple wouldn't listen. They refused to give up.

They should have been enjoying their retirement, but instead, they were奔波ing abroad.

Sebastian was deeply moved, but simply said, "Come, let's go see the back garden."

"Wonderful! Emilia loved the swing and the wisteria in the back garden the most..."

Sebastian supported the old woman as they walked inside.

His phone rang.

He glanced at the screen and subtly moved the phone away, preventing the old woman from seeing.

"Grandmother, I need to take this call."

"Alright."

Once outside the main house, Sebastian answered the call.

"Mother, what is it?"

"Why did it take you so long to answer?" Irene Valdemar's tone was impatient. "Where are you?"

Sebastian replied flatly, "I was busy earlier. I'm out."

"Busy with what? Who are you with?"

Sebastian frowned. "Mother, I'm not a prisoner. There's no need to interrogate me."

"You're the prisoner?! Ha—" Irene's voice turned shrill. "Isn't it the other way around? I'm the prisoner! All of you are guarding against me!"

"Mother, why would you say that?"

"Your grandparents returned to the country. Why wasn't I told?"

Sebastian was silent.

"I knew it. You did it on purpose!"

"Mother..." His voice was weary.

"You're with them right now, aren't you? I went to the old house. The housekeeper said you picked them up. Did you think you could fool me?"

"..."

"Where are you now? I'm coming over."

Sebastian's expression tightened. "Mother, please calm down. Grandmother is not in a good state emotionally. Perhaps another day."

Irene snapped, "What do you mean by that? The old lady is upset, so I can't come? Are you implying that seeing me would make her even more upset?! I'm her daughter! I can't understand why you all guard against me like I'm some kind of thief!"

All these years, the old couple preferred to contact Sebastian rather than communicate with her.

On the rare occasions she called them, they always found an excuse to cut the conversation short.

Sebastian said, "You know the reason very well. Must I spell it out?"

"Go on! Say it! I'd love to hear what you've been holding back!"

Sebastian clenched his jaw, his face rigid.

"Mother, I don't want to argue with you." This was his final act of patience.

But the person on the other end wouldn't let it go. "No! We must make this clear today—I am your mother, not your enemy!"

"Fine." Sebastian took a deep breath, enunciating each word carefully. "Grandmother has always held reservations about you because of what happened back then. Your appearance now will only upset her further. The doctor has given his final warning. Grandmother cannot withstand any more emotional distress. Why do you think Grandfather insisted on bringing her back? Do you really think it was because they missed you and me?!"

Irene opened her mouth to retort, but no sound came out.

Sebastian ended the call and went back inside.

"Sebastian, who was on the phone?"

"Business. It's handled."

"Good."
###Chapter 258

Irene stared at the disconnected phone.
She violently swept the tray off the table.
Bird's Nest Soup splattered across the floor.
The shattering of the porcelain bowl was piercing.
"Madam..." The housekeepers trembled, not daring to look up.
"Get out!" Irene pointed at the door, her refined features contorted.
The housekeepers hastily retreated.
Irene collapsed onto the sofa, her chest heaving violently.
All these years, she had desperately tried to please the old couple.
The old man had softened, at least allowing for peaceful coexistence.
Only the old lady remained perpetually cold and distant.
"Sir is home." The butler's announcement barely finished before Theodore stepped inside.
He saw the mess on the floor.
His gaze swept over Irene.
He said nothing and headed straight upstairs.
Irene shot to her feet. "Aren't you going to ask why I'm so upset?"
Theodore loosened his cufflinks, his tone indifferent. "Suit yourself."
He could always buy new things.
"Theodore! I am your wife! Could you at least show some concern for my feelings?"
The man raised an eyebrow. "What's wrong with you today?"
"You've been like this for years, and only now you ask?"
Irene gritted her teeth. "I just found out today that your parents returned a week ago! Your son deliberately kept it from me!"
Theodore admitted calmly. "I knew. I had dinner with them a couple of days ago."
Irene's anger flared instantly. "You knew and didn't tell me? The whole household knew, only I was kept in the dark! I'm treated worse than the help!"
Theodore frowned. "No one deliberately hid it from you. Even the housekeepers knew your parents were back, but you didn't? Shouldn't you reflect on that?"
It was her fault again!
It was always her fault!
Irene completely lost control. "Do you think it's all my fault that your parents despise me? You and your son are the same, never considering me!"
"They are my parents, yet you went to have dinner with them alone. Is that appropriate, Theodore?"
The man looked at her calmly. "They are your parents, and also my in-laws. What's the problem with me having a meal with them?"
"In-laws? Right. No matter which Sullivan daughter you married, they would always be your in-laws, wouldn't they?"
Theodore's face darkened. "What nonsense are you talking?"
"Nonsense? You visit them abroad every year, but you never take me. Theodore, just who are you playing the filial son for?"
The man's expression was blank. "Don't you know why I don't take you?"
"Ha... I know! You all blame me! Your parents blame you, and you blame me! You think it should have been me who disappeared back then, not Emilia!"
"You all wish I were the one who died!"
"Enough!" Theodore's eyes turned icy. "Say another word about death, I dare you."
"Twenty-eight years! Do you still think she's alive? The old man and old lady refusing to give up, I understand. But you, Theodore? We've been married over twenty years, our son is about to start his own family, and you're still pining for her? Isn't that disgusting?"
Slap—
The slap was sharp and clean.
Theodore's veins bulged, his gaze frigid. "If you can't speak properly, then never speak again."
He turned and strode away.
Irene screamed at his retreating back. "Theodore, you have no conscience!"
Why did everyone remember Emilia?
Just because she was the biological one?
...
Meanwhile, Sebastian followed the elderly couple through the courtyard.
They exited through a small gate onto the street.
Sebastian was surprised. "I've been here so many times, I never knew this gate existed."
Isaac chuckled. "Your aunt used to sneak out this way all the time. We found out long ago, just never said anything."
A slight smile touched Florence's lips at the memory.
The old man looked down the long alley. "Everything else has changed. Only this place remains the same."
Sebastian said softly, "Dad and I bought the three surrounding streets. They won't be developed. We'll keep them as they are."
Just in case the lost one returns, she can still find her way home.
Florence's eyes grew warm. "Your father is thoughtful."
Sebastian pointed ahead. "That street has changed a lot. Shall I take you to see?"
The elderly couple nodded in agreement.
The snack street had long queues.
The bakery was bustling with activity.
Florence squinted. "Is that T&T Bakery?"
"Same old storefront. It's a internet celebrity store now."
"Emilia loved their mung bean cakes the most."
Sebastian helped the elders rest in a tea house. "I'll go queue."
The line was very long. At least a ten-minute wait.
"Sebastian?"
A familiar voice called out.
Sophia waved from further up the line. "It is you! Even the CEO has to queue himself?"
Sebastian smiled lightly. "What are you doing here?"
"Bringing my parents to visit Atlante Gardens."
"Where are your parents?"
"Resting in the tea house. I'm here to buy mung bean cakes."
Mom suddenly wanted some.
###Chapter 259

Isabella Sullivan stopped in front of the bakery.

She said she wanted mung bean cakes.

Sophia Sullivan studied the shop.
The facade was old.
The decor was outdated.
There were no promotional posters.
The sign was tucked away in the back.
You had to get close to read the menu.

Mung bean cakes were listed.

How did Mom know this place sold them?

She even said they were the specialty.

Isabella said, "Intuition. I felt they would have them, and that they'd be good."

David Sullivan added, "Your mother has a good nose. She can smell whether something is delicious or not."

Sophia nodded.
It was true.

Sebastian Evans appeared.
"What a coincidence. I'm here for mung bean cakes too."

"For yourself?"

He shook his head.
"For my grandmother."

"Is Grandma here?" Sophia looked around.
"I don't see her."

"She got tired from shopping and is resting at the tea house."
"It's a perfect chance to introduce your parents."
"At the book signing last time, she wanted to come upstairs, but she wasn't feeling well and had to leave early."

"Sure." Sophia smiled.

Since they were both buying the cakes, Sophia was in line first.
She ordered two portions.
She handed one to Sebastian.

"How much? I'll transfer it to you," he said.

Sophia waved her hand.
"My treat for Grandma."
"You gave me water last time and didn't take any money."

Sebastian chuckled softly.

"Let's go." Sophia glanced back.
Why was he grinning like that?

Two elderly figures sat by the window of the tea house.

Sophia greeted them first.

The old lady's fatigue seemed to vanish upon seeing her.
A wide smile spread across her face.

"...Grandma, Sophia bought mung bean cakes for you."

Florence Atlante said, "Weren't you supposed to queue? Why did you let the young lady buy them?"

Sebastian started to explain, but Sophia cut in.
"I was already in line, so I got them."

"Thank you... such a good child."

The old lady held Sophia's hand.
She asked softly, "You are so kind, you must be very pretty."
"My eyes aren't good, I can't see clearly..."
"May I touch your face?"

Sophia couldn't refuse.
"Of course."

She gently guided the elderly woman's hand.
Just as it was about to reach her cheek, David's voice called from upstairs—

"Sophia!"

He and Isabella were on the second floor.
They had seen their daughter enter with Sebastian and approach an elderly couple.

The couple had their backs turned, their faces unclear.

David waved.
Isabella was already descending the stairs.

"Wait for me, honey."

"The mung bean cakes, hurry."

"Coming..."

Sophia smiled.
"That was my dad just now."
"You didn't see my mom; they're coming over now."
"I'll introduce you in a moment."

"Wonderful."

Sophia picked up a cake.
"Would you like to try one first?"

The old lady was about to speak.
Sebastian's phone rang.

His expression turned grim after answering.
"Understood. Keep things stable. I'll be there as soon as possible..."

He ended the call.

He looked at Sophia.
"An emergency at the company. I have to go."

Then to the elderly couple.
"Grandpa, Grandma, let me take you home first?"
"We can continue another day?"

"Alright. But Sophia's parents..." They hadn't met them.

Sophia immediately said, "It's fine. There will be other opportunities."

"Okay."

By the time Isabella and David approached, Sebastian had already left with the elderly couple.

Isabella looked outside.
"Who were those elderly people?"

"Sebastian's grandparents."
"We met briefly at the book signing. Ran into them again today."

Isabella didn't think much of it.
"What a coincidence."
"Tired? Ready to go home?"

"Let's walk a bit more. We haven't finished the street yet." Sophia linked arms with her mother, acting cute.

Isabella laughed.
"Alright, let's keep strolling."

...

In the car—

Sebastian was on the phone while driving.
"...Keep them calm first. I'll handle the rest when I arrive."

Isaac Atlante said, "If it's urgent, drop us off. We can take a taxi."

"It's under control. My team is handling it."

"Good."

Sebastian was silent for a moment.
He finally spoke.

"Grandpa, what are your plans for this trip back?"
"How long are you staying?"
"I know some excellent doctors. Should I arrange a consultation for Grandma?"

Isaac said, "You arrange it."

"There's something else." He tested.
"Mom misses you both terribly."
"She knows about Grandma's eyes and has been asking me to find specialists."
"She doesn't know you're back..."
"Could we meet? A family dinner?"

The air in the car grew still.

Isaac frowned, silent.

Florence spoke directly.
"We are not feeling well. We won't be receiving guests."
"Thank you for the thought."

Receiving guests...

Irene was just a guest.

The old lady was being polite.
Her attitude was clear.
Sebastian didn't push further.

A moment of quiet passed.

Sebastian remembered something his assistant mentioned.
"The ten-year contract with the government for Atlante Gardens is expiring."
"It's been open to the public for free."
"Should we renew?"

Atlante Gardens was private property.
Free public access wasn't a donation.
The government only had management rights.

A shadow passed through Isaac's eyes.
He sighed.

"Renew it."
"Sign for another ten years."

If Emilia ever returned, she would at least see a familiar place.
###Chapter 260

Isabella Sullivan enjoyed the gardens and sampled the mung bean cakes, feeling completely content.

Early the next morning, the couple set off to return to the neighboring city.

Sophia Sullivan personally saw them off at the train station.

Stone Macmillan arrived, slightly out of breath.

"Professor Sullivan, letters from your readers sent to the publishing house. They asked me to pass them on."

Isabella's eyes lit up.

This was her first time receiving fan mail.

It was a thick stack, feeling substantial and heavy in her hands.

...

Back home, the sunlight was just right.

Sophia stripped the bedsheets and duvet covers from two rooms for washing.

By late October, the summer heat had gradually faded, replaced by a refreshing autumn breeze.

She organized her closet, putting away summer clothes and hanging out autumn wear.

By the time she finished, it was already two in the afternoon, and she hadn't eaten lunch.

The refrigerator only held two tomatoes.

Sophia sighed, resignedly changing her shoes to go out.

She needed to go grocery shopping.

"Heading out?" She ran into Alexander Laurent just after going downstairs.

"Yes, grocery shopping." Sophia nodded.

"Perfect, I'll join you."

Alexander turned and fell into step beside her.

"What are you buying, Professor?"

Alexander averted his gaze. "Which supermarket are you going to?"

There were three nearby.

All within walking distance.

Sophia named one. "Is that okay?"

Her question was deftly sidestepped.

Alexander: "That's fine."

A few minutes later, they entered the supermarket.

The old neighborhood was convenient, with all amenities close by.

Apart from the lack of elevators and the buildings being a bit old, everything was good.

Sophia walked ahead, Alexander pushing the cart behind her.

She stopped, he stopped.

Maintaining a half-step distance, like an ordinary couple.

The crabs in the seafood section were plump and fresh.

Sophia didn't care for spicy crab, finding it too much trouble, but she loved crab roe buns.

"Miss, the crabs are fresh. Want some?"

Sophia nodded. "A bag, please."

"You got it."

She bent over to select crabs, her hair slipping forward and nearly touching the water.

She straightened up quickly, wanting to tie her hair, but found no hair tie on her wrist.

She sighed, remembering the gray claw clip in her bag.

She'd bought it at the night market yesterday.

She gathered her hair and clipped it up.

It was loose, but at least it was out of the way.

Sophia continued picking crabs.

Her happiness lasted less than five seconds—

Her hair came completely loose.

She was speechless.

Alexander took the clip. "Stand still."

"...Okay." Sophia obeyed.

The man gathered her hair, twisted it up, and secured it firmly with the clip—all in under thirty seconds.

Sophia shook her head slightly. It held steady.

"Professor, have you known how to do that for a long time?" she asked quietly.

Alexander: "Second time. Yesterday was the first."

Sophia: "..."
She was a little defeated.

The crabs selected, Alexander took them to be weighed.

Sophia also bought several pounds of flour and handed them to him.

He took them naturally.

They worked together seamlessly.

After weighing the items, they bought vegetables, meat, and eggs.

Passing the household goods aisle, Alexander stopped. "Need to buy anything here?"

Sophia remembered her body wash and laundry detergent were running low. "Yes."

While she selected body wash, Alexander was also putting things into the cart.

Sophia glimpsed towels, slippers, hooks...

The shopping cart was piled high like a small mountain.

At checkout, Alexander paid without hesitation. Sophia didn't argue, just asked him to keep the receipt to settle up later.

Alexander nodded, gesturing for her to wait outside. "It's crowded here."

"Okay." Sophia left through the exit lane.

Soon, Alexander emerged carrying three large bags.

Sophia reached out to help, but the man stepped back, avoiding her. "No need, I've got it."

"But there's so much..."

One bag held groceries, the other two held household items each.

Clearly separated.

"...Are you sure you don't want me to carry one?" Sophia asked again.

"No."

Men really did have better stamina. Alexander carried the bags up seven flights of stairs without even sounding winded.

Sophia took her two bags and placed them by the door, then asked Alexander for the receipt.

"Ahem—" The man cleared his throat lightly. "It wasn't much, don't worry about it."

"That won't do. Is the receipt in one of the bags? Mine don't have it. Professor, let me check your bags..."

He recoiled as if shocked, avoiding Sophia's gaze.

Sophia: "?"

"...It's not in there. I'll calculate the total and text you. You can transfer me later."

"That works too." Sophia nodded.

But...

Why had he dodged like that?

Was he afraid she'd see inside his shopping bags?

Was there something in there he didn't want her to see?

The doubt flickered through her mind, but she didn't dwell on it.

She carried her bags inside to cook.

So hungry...

She simply boiled a bowl of noodles, adding a fried egg, ham, and greens.

It looked good and tasted delicious.

A full bowl later, she was satisfied.

After resting for ten minutes, she rolled up her sleeves and went into the kitchen.

Kneading dough, letting it rest, picking out crab roe...

Two hours later, the crab roe buns were ready.

She steamed four batches, over thirty buns, enough to last a while.

...

Meanwhile, Alexander entered his apartment and breathed a sigh of relief.

He glanced at the shopping bag. Why did he feel like a thief?

It wasn't like he'd stolen anything!

He shook his head wryly and took the items out of the bag.

Towels, slippers, hooks...

These weren't the main point.

The main purchase today was—

Underwear.

That's why he didn't dare let Sophia touch the bag.

Perhaps it was instinctive embarrassment, perhaps shyness, or more likely, a guilty conscience.

The moment she reached out, his whole body went numb.

Thankfully...

He'd reacted quickly.

Alexander sat down, took out his phone, and sent a text—

[Receipt total 542. My share 263, your share 279]

Sophia, playing on her phone while waiting for the buns, replied instantly:

[That little? You didn't buy much.]

[Towel, slippers, underwear, hooks, dish soap. Just these, right?]

These cost over two hundred?

Alexander: !
###Chapter 261

Sophia Sullivan wasn't sure how many he usually ate.

Alexander Laurent had suddenly stopped replying.

She finished steaming all the buns and selected ten, placing them into a fresh bag.

She decided to bring them to him.

She knocked for half a minute, but no one answered.

She took out her phone to text.

[Are you home, Professor?]

Alexander replied quickly.

[At the lab.]

Sophia: [I made Crab Roe Buns. Saved ten for you. Want to get them tonight?]

Alexander initially meant to refuse.

He typed halfway, then deleted it.

It felt rude to coldly reject something a girl made by hand.

And it would seem suspicious.

[Okay.]

Sophia put her phone away and went home.

She had just finished cleaning the kitchen and sat down.

Olivia Lopez called.

"Sweetie! Are my Crab Roe Buns ready?"

"Ready. Made dozens. Enough for you."

Olivia rushed out of the company elevator in her heels.

A full week of overtime was finally over.

She didn't want to stay a second longer.

"Ugh! You're the馋 one! Wait for me, I'm coming~" Olivia's voice was sugary sweet.

She hung up and put her phone away.

Her steps suddenly halted.

"Julian Winston?"

The man stood not far away, hands in his pockets, expression dark.

"What are you doing here?" Olivia walked up to him.

Up close, his face was even darker than she imagined.

"Am I interrupting your flirting?" Julian snorted. "Ugh~"

Olivia's mouth twitched. "Are you on something?"

"On what? I'm not the馋 one here, big girl~"

Olivia was speechless.

"In a hurry to meet someone? I'll get out of your way. Take off those heels, you'll run faster barefoot."

Olivia resisted the urge to pull a knife.

Julian: "I drove. I'll give you a ride for free."

"Julian, if you're sick, move. Don't waste my time!"

The buns were getting cold.

"Not moving—" He leaned in, face close.

Olivia shoved him aside.

"Try that again?"

"And what?"

"I'll kick your third leg off!"

Julian clamped his legs together, eyes wide.

"Are you even a woman? How can you say that!"

"What does being a woman have to do with it? Do words have genders?"

He was left speechless.

Olivia was impatient. "Move. I have things to do!"

"In a hurry to see your little boytoy?"

"Julian, what's wrong with you today? You won't stop!"

"You're yelling at me? You don't reply to my messages! Don't answer my calls! What kind of business partner are you?"

Olivia was even more exasperated.

"Those are messages? 'What are you doing?' 'Eaten yet?' 'Asleep?' And you send nose-picking emojis. How am I supposed to reply?"

"..."

"I'm busy. Worked overtime all week. No time for nonsense. I need to eat and rest!"

Julian immediately said, "Let me treat you to dinner!"

"No need. Someone else is. You can take a number."

She started to leave.

Julian chased after her. "Then let me drive you?"

Olivia paused. "Seriously?"

"Yeah!"

"Fine. Drive fast."

She hadn't driven this week. This was convenient.

Julian eagerly opened the passenger door.

Olivia: "I'll sit in the back. Easier to lie down."

"...Fine."

In the car, Julian sighed inwardly as he steered.

Was there a better boyfriend in the world than him?

Waited an hour to pick her up from work, only to drive her to see someone else.

If he didn't drive her, she'd be long gone.

He had to see what kind of dog had her so bewitched!

Olivia lay down in the back seat.

"Why the big sigh?"

Julian: "I sighed?"

"Just now."

"You said you worked overtime all week?"

"Yeah." Olivia adjusted her pillow.

Much more comfortable.

"Busy like that, but still had time for tennis?" His tone turned sarcastic again.

Olivia raised an eyebrow. "Charlie told you?"

"Hmph!"

"You guys hang out. Are Charlie and Ethan Roscente both insane?"

Julian: "??"

"I hired a coach to correct my form. He charged over and started a fight. Almost broke his nose. Cost me twenty grand. Is he off his meds?"

"...A coach?"

Olivia: "What else?"

"Heh... nothing... heh heh..."

Olivia: "?"

Sighing turned to giggling? Definitely off his meds!

Julian: "The address? Where am I driving?"

Olivia: "To Sophia's place. You know the way, right?"

"Sophia Sullivan? You're going to see her?!"

"What else? So many questions."

"Heh heh... I'll talk less," he grinned ear to ear. "Vivi, you must be tired from overtime..."

Vivi?

"How about a oil SPA? I'll use my mom's card. They do house calls."

Olivia stared at the back of his head, eyes narrowed.

She asked cautiously.

"You didn't... just get out of a mental hospital, did you?"

Julian: "..."

At the apartment building, Olivia rushed upstairs.

The door opened, the aroma of crab roe wafting out.

"Hurry, hurry! I want to eat ten!"

...

After eating, she lay on the sofa, fruit platter in hand, watching a variety show.

Perfectly content.

At ten p.m., Olivia reluctantly prepared to leave.

Sophia: "Really not staying the night?"

Olivia: "Date tomorrow. No time to go back and change."

"...Okay." Sophia saw her to the door.

Olivia walked out of the alley, about to hail a cab.

A familiar car was parked by the roadside.

She walked over and knocked on the window.

Julian jolted awake—

Shit, fell asleep waiting?!

Olivia crossed her arms, studying him. "What's wrong with you?"
###Chapter 262

I was a bit tired and wanted to pull over to rest for a while before continuing, but I accidentally fell asleep…

Olivia Lopez went directly around to the other side, opened the passenger door, and got in.

"Perfect. Take me home."

Julian Winston snorted lightly. "You really don't treat yourself like an outsider."

Even as he said this, the corners of his mouth turned up uncontrollably.

"Fine. I'll do a good deed today and see it through to the end. Hold on tight—"

He slammed on the accelerator, and the sports car shot out like an arrow.

Olivia: "Holy shit! Slow down! I haven't lived enough yet, I don't want to go to heaven with you!"

"What's wrong with that? Dying together, hehe…"

Olivia just rolled her eyes at him.

Given their current relationship, even if they died, they'd be buried separately.

Twenty minutes later—

Olivia: "Just stop at the gate. I'll walk in."

"No! I haven't delivered you properly yet!"

Julian turned the steering wheel and drove directly into the underground garage.

"Thanks." The car stopped, and Olivia pushed the door open to get out.

"Hey, just leaving like that?"

Olivia paused. "Do I need to pay the fare?"

"Hehe, no need. Who are we to each other? Right?"

Olivia: "Get to the point."

Julian: "I haven't had dinner. I'm starving."

"So?"

"Go to your place and make me something to eat."

Olivia spread her hands. "Sorry, I don't cook."

Julian had already thought of a countermeasure. "You don't need to do anything. I saw instant noodles in the cabinet last time. I'll go up and make them myself."

"Fine." Olivia turned and motioned for him to follow.

Julian immediately got out, locked the car, and trotted after her into the elevator.

Olivia: "You could find any restaurant outside, or just order takeout. Either is better than instant noodles."

"I just like this, what's wrong with that?"

Olivia gave him a thumbs-up. "You're something else."

Julian: "…" Got sarcasm again.

While she was entering the code, he peeked.

168…

What came next?

Damn it! Blinked and missed it!

The door opened. Olivia went straight in without paying him any mind.

Julian didn't need an invitation. He swaggered in, changed his shoes, completely at ease as if it were his own home.

Olivia turned and pointed to the kitchen. "Help yourself. I'm going to take a shower…"

With that, she went into the bedroom.

Julian looked around, touched things here and there, and rummaged through the fridge.

Wow…

It really was just instant noodles!

Fortunately, there were plenty of drinks in the fridge, and good wine in the liquor cabinet.

He picked a dry red, opened it to let it breathe, then put it in the fridge to chill.

When the noodles were almost done, he took the decanter out.

Slightly cool, not icy. Perfect.

Time to eat!

Olivia came out from her shower wearing a white bathrobe, her hair still wrapped up. She saw Julian crouched behind the coffee table slurping noodles like a monkey, eating while watching TV.

A glass of red wine sat beside him, condensation misting the sides…

"You chilled it in the fridge?"

"Yep!" He looked up, noodles still hanging from his mouth.

Olivia looked at him with disgust.

A proper rich young master, how could he be so sloppy?

"Finish chewing before you speak. It's disgusting."

Julian slurped the rest into his mouth. "Chew what? The bowl is full of broken noodles. That's disgusting."

"…"

"You don't actually eat noodles like that, do you?"

Olivia: "…"

"Hmm?" He pressed.

Olivia: "I. Don't. Eat. Noodles."

Julian's face said 'like I believe that.'

She turned to go back to her room, but he suddenly spoke.

"Not having a glass?"

Olivia looked back, her gaze sweeping over the misty decanter.

It was exactly the wine she liked, and perfectly chilled…

"Fine, pour me a glass!"

It was really hard to refuse.

Julian immediately went to get a glass.

"Here, try it. I decanted it. Guaranteed to satisfy!"

Olivia took it, her mouth twitching. "That's because my wine is good."

"Yes, yes, your wine is good, my technique is good. We're a perfect match, alright?"

"You can be shameless, but don't drag me into it." Olivia said, tilting her head back for a sip.

Julian: "…" She really never takes a loss.

After just one sip, Olivia had to admit Julian did know his stuff.

"How is it? Not disappointed, right?" He lifted his chin, arms crossed.

"…It's alright." She was afraid praising him would make him cocky.

"Just alright?!"

Olivia took another sip. "Mhm~"

"…"

"Hey, are you going to eat your noodles or not? They'll get soggy."

"Shit—Are they soggy?" Julian immediately crouched back down and buried his head in his noodles.

By the time he had finished off both noodles and broth, an empty wine glass was thrust in front of him.

A transparent glass, curved body, held by a woman's slender, jade-like fingers, abruptly crashing into his line of sight.

A delicate wrist, pale back of the hand, even the nail beds were a glossy, tender pink.

The man was mesmerized.

"…Did you hear me?!"

"Huh?" Julian looked up, dazed. "What did you say just now?"

Olivia: "Another glass."

"Oh! Okay!"

He hurriedly reached out to take the glass, but in his fluster, instead of the glass, he grabbed the woman's hand.

In that instant, it felt like an electric shock ran through Julian from head to toe, every pore contracting uncontrollably.

Smack!

A sharp sound.

Julian stared blankly, instinctively withdrawing his hand to look at the back of it.

Damn! It was red!

"Why did you hit me?"

"For making you pour wine, not for letting you cop a feel. Hitting a pervert like you is exactly what you deserve!"

"No… How am I a pervert?! I just accidentally touched your hand! I didn't touch anywhere else…"

His voice trailed off towards the end.

Whether he was in the wrong or just feeling guilty, he definitely lacked conviction.

Olivia glared. "You want to touch somewhere else？！How about you just go to heaven?! Seems like you've done plenty of sleazy things before, made a habit of it, huh?"

"Let me tell you, touching any part of a girl without her consent, even her feet or her hair, is sleazy."

"I'm going easy on you, I didn't slap your face. And you're still complaining?!"

Julian: "I…"

"You what you?! If you're wrong, stand straight and take your punishment. No excuses!"

"…"

Couldn't win. Really couldn't win an argument.

In the end, he could only obediently pour her more wine.

"…I admit I was wrong, I apologize. Please, have a drink~"

"That's more like it."

Olivia took a couple of sips and leaned back comfortably into the sofa.

Julian refilled his own glass.

The more they drank, the more intoxicating it became. Olivia, this vicious woman, was fierce, but her taste was definitely on point.

The night deepened.

Glass after glass went down, and the drunkenness grew stronger and stronger…
###Chapter 263

Olivia put down her wine glass.

She stood up.

"No more."

There was a man in her house.

Too much alcohol could lead to trouble.

She needed to stay clear-headed.

Julian paused mid-motion.

"We haven't finished it yet."

"You're leaving already?"

Olivia shot him a glance.

"Did you really mistake my place for a bar?"

"Planning to drink endlessly?"

Julian swirled the decanter.

"It's all aerated now."

"What a waste not to finish it."

Olivia raised an eyebrow.

"It's not a waste."

"I'll drink it by myself tomorrow."

Julian was speechless.

Olivia pointed at the wall clock.

"It's getting late."

"Time for you to go."

Julian made a disapproving sound.

"Is that how you are?"

Olivia crossed her arms.

"How am I?"

"You want me around when you need me."

"You kick me out when you don't."

"Have you ever seen anyone like this?"

Olivia snorted lightly.

"What else?"

"Should I invite you to stay the night?"

Julian leaned closer.

"It's normal for a boyfriend to stay at his girlfriend's place."

"Even though we're fake."

"Shouldn't we make it look convincing?"

Olivia pushed him away.

"Boring."

"Who cares if we live together or not?"

Before she finished speaking.

Her phone rang.

It was a WeChat video call.

Julian glanced at the screen.

A smirk touched his lips.

"Someone who cares is calling."

Before Olivia could react.

He already answered.

"Mom, what's up so late?"

Penelope's voice came through.

"Where are you?"

"This doesn't look like your place."

Julian laughed.

"Olivia's place."

Penelope sounded surprised.

"Really?"

"Don't lie to me…"

Julian turned the phone toward Olivia.

"Say hello to her."

"Olivia, my mom—"

Olivia instantly put on a bright smile.

She sat down next to him.

"Good evening, Auntie."

Penelope beamed.

"Good, good, good!"

"I didn't expect you to really be there."

"Getting ready to rest?"

Olivia nodded obediently.

"Mhm~"

Penelope advised.

"Remember to dry your hair properly."

"It's not good to keep it wrapped for too long."

Olivia agreed.

"I know, Auntie."

"I'll dry it in a bit."

Penelope added.

"Let Julian help you."

Olivia continued nodding.

"Okay~"

Penelope noticed her wrist.

"That bracelet is so pretty."

"I knew I picked the right one!"

It was that Imperial Green Jadeite bangle.

Olivia's eyes curved into smiles.

"You have great taste, Auntie."

Penelope was delighted.

"I have many treasures tucked away."

"You just wear them."

"They'll all be yours someday!"

Julian was an only child.

The only one to inherit the jewelry would be his wife.

Olivia laughed at herself inwardly.

She wasn't that fortunate.

But her words remained cheerful.

"Thank you, Auntie~"

Penelope was satisfied.

"I won't disturb you two anymore."

"Goodnight~"

Olivia waved.

"Goodbye, Auntie."

The call ended.

Julian put away his phone.

"See."

"My mom is always watching."

Olivia stood up.

"We got through that one."

"Time for you to leave."

"I need to sleep."

Julian stopped her.

"Where's the hair dryer?"

Olivia looked back.

"Why?"

Julian stated matter-of-factly.

"My mom just gave me a task."

"To dry your hair for you."

Olivia refused.

"No need."

"I can do it myself."

Julian insisted.

"No."

"I need to take a picture and send it to her."

"Otherwise, she'll nag again tomorrow."

Olivia gave in.

"Fine."

"Hurry up."

Julian picked up the dryer.

His fingers deftly combed through her strands.

Olivia narrowed her eyes.

"Not your first time doing this, is it?"

Julian sounded proud.

"I'm good at everything."

Olivia scoffed lightly.

"How many girls have you dried hair for?"

"To get this skilled."

Julian raised an eyebrow.

"Jealous?"

Olivia snorted.

"Hardly."

"You're not my man."

"I don't care who you've dried hair for."

She touched her chin.

"With skills like yours."

"If you go bankrupt someday."

"You could become a hairdresser."

"Be self-reliant."

Julian was speechless.

"Done."

He turned off the dryer.

Olivia ran her fingers through her hair.

It was smooth and not dried out.

He did a good job.

Julian looked expectant.

"How is it?"

For the first time, Olivia gave approval.

"Open a salon."

"I'll get a membership card immediately."

Julian's mouth twitched.

She yawned.

Walked straight to the bed.

Fell backward onto it.

Rolled over twice.

Pulled the covers tight.

"I'm sleeping."

"Turn off the light and close the door."

"Then leave."

"Bye~"

Julian screamed internally.

But his actions were obedient.

He turned off the light.

Gently closed the door.

Falling asleep slightly tipsy felt especially comfortable.

Olivia was soon asleep.

Julian walked to the living room.

Looked at the red wine in the decanter.

He thought for a moment.

Picked up a wine glass.

Poured another glass.

One glass after another.

Until the decanter was empty.

His head felt fuzzy.

His vision blurred.

His whole body felt light.

But his consciousness was clear.

The aftereffect was kicking in.

The wine was good.

The feeling was wonderful.

He lay down on the sofa.

Planning to rest a bit before leaving.

But then…

He fell directly asleep.

In the middle of the night.

Olivia was thirsty.

Got up to get water.

Opened the bedroom door.

The living room light was still on.

Bleary-eyed, she thought she'd forgotten to turn it off.

Reached out and switched it off.

Drank her water.

Headed back to the bedroom.

Passed the sofa.

Her wrist was suddenly grabbed.

Olivia's scalp prickled.

She instantly woke up.

Reacted by swinging her other hand.

Mid-swing.

It was caught by a warm, large palm.

Both her hands were now restrained.

"Julian—"

Before she could erupt.

He pulled her sharply.

Olivia stumbled forward.

Fell into an embrace smelling of alcohol.

Crashed against a hard chest.

"What are you doing?!" she snapped.

Julian's fingers threaded through her hair.

Pressed against her scalp.

Gently stroked her earlobe.

A shiver ran through Olivia's body.

A tingling numbness spread.

"You—"

She just started to speak.

The world spun.

The man pressed her down beneath him.

"Julian, are you insane?!"

"Didn't I tell you to leave?!"

"Why are you sleeping on my sofa?!"

"Olivia…"

In the darkness.

The soft murmur made her freeze.

"You…" She was stunned.

"Olivia Lopez."

He said her name again.

His enunciation was clear.

His tone intimate.

That first name wasn't a mistake.

"Julian, let me first—"

He didn't let her finish.

The man lowered his head.

Covered her mouth.

Their lips met.

Olivia's mind exploded—

Shattered!

She didn't know how much time passed.

Before she could react.

"Mmph mmph mmph—" Get off me!

In the darkness.

The man chuckled lowly.

"Olivia, don't you want it?"
###Chapter 264

Morning light filtered through the gap in the curtains.

Clothes were scattered across the floor.

From the living room sofa to the bedroom door.

Mostly men's shirts and pants.

Only one woman's nightgown was mixed in.

Julian Winston slowly opened his eyes.

Images of last night's passion flooded his mind.

The corner of his mouth lifted unconsciously.

He turned his head to look at the woman sleeping beside him.

His gaze instantly softened.

Olivia Lopez was still deep in sleep.

Her breathing was even.

Her eyelashes fluttered lightly.

His eyes swept over her delicate features.

Finally resting on her neck.

Pale skin covered in red marks.

All left by him the previous night.

Julian was no impulsive youth.

But last night he was like a leopard tasting fresh prey.

Insatiable.

It only stopped when Olivia slapped him.

The pain was real.

The pleasure was even more real.

Thinking of this, his smile deepened.

He leaned down and gently kissed her forehead.

Throwing back the covers, he got up.

He walked out of the room quietly.

Carefully closing the door behind him.

In the kitchen, Julian turned around holding two bowls of noodles.

Olivia leaned against the doorframe in a silk camisole.

He didn't know how long she had been standing there.

Their eyes met.

A flicker of embarrassment passed through Julian's eyes.

Quickly replaced by teasing.

"Up already? Seems I didn't try hard enough."

Olivia didn't smile.

Her gaze fell on his hands.

Two bowls of instant noodles, each with a fried egg.

The edges slightly burnt.

Julian cleared his throat lightly. "This is all you had. Make do with it."

He passed by her and placed the bowls on the dining table.

Olivia looked at him with a complex expression.

At him.

At the noodles.

Julian said, "Sit and eat. Why stare at me? Suddenly realized I'm devastatingly handsome?"

Olivia was silent for two seconds. "Put some clothes on first."

She had just reached the kitchen door.

And saw his completely bare back.

The visual impact was too strong.

Julian paused. "My clothes are dirty. Nothing to change into."

Olivia: "..."

Was it so hard to wrap a towel around yourself?

Julian said, "You get to see this body for free and you're complaining?"

"...Not my type, thanks."

She walked to the table.

Julian pulled out a chair for her.

Handed her chopsticks.

Olivia took them silently.

Julian pointed beside her hand. "Poured you some ice water."

"...Thanks."

He hesitated before speaking. "About last night..."

Olivia said, "No talking during meals."

Julian lowered his head and ate his noodles.

Olivia put down her chopsticks after eating half.

Julian looked up. "Done?"

"Yeah. Full."

"Don't waste it. Give it here."

He pulled her bowl over and started eating.

Olivia didn't have time to stop him.

He finished the noodles and drank all the soup.

Julian leaned back in his chair, satisfied.

Olivia looked at him calmly. "Full now?"

"Full."

"Pack your things and leave. Don't come back."

Julian's smile froze.

"What do you mean?"

Olivia said, "Exactly what I said. I told you I don't mix business with pleasure."

"Since it's already happened, the only solution is to terminate our cooperation."

Julian sat up straight.

His gaze darkened. "I wasn't drunk last night. Neither were you."

"Yes."

They were both sober.

This wasn't a case of drunken mistake.

Julian sneered. "Kick the donkey out right after grinding the mill?"

The corner of Olivia's mouth twitched. "You're the one who won't get dressed. Who's fault is that? Call yourself a donkey if you want."

"I object!" His voice rose. "Olivia, do you know what you're like?"

"?"

"A fuckboy who seduces virgins and doesn't take responsibility!"

Olivia was silent for two seconds. "Are you a virgin?"

Julian: "?!"

"We were both willing last night. Don't play innocent. You've slept with so many women. Did you take responsibility for each one? Likewise, I don't need to take responsibility for you."

The boomerang hit right between the eyes.

Julian scoffed. "Who wants your responsibility! Do I lack women?"

Olivia breathed a sigh of relief. "Good."

Julian watched her relieved expression.

His fists clenched.

But his voice remained steady. "What happens between adults stays between adults. But what's with ending our partnership? What about professional integrity?"

Olivia said seriously, "Mixing business with emotions leads to trouble. Cutting losses early is best for everyone."

She hated complications.

She thought he felt the same.

Julian's mouth twisted. "My mom video-called last night and saw us being affectionate. If I tell her we broke up today, will she believe it?"

Olivia: "..."

"Want to end it? Fine. Convince my mom and I'll agree."

Olivia frowned. "Terms?"

"You can see it that way."

She laughed. "Julian, do you think I play by the rules? Your agreement isn't important. I'll end it if I want to. What can you do about it?"

Julian's eyes widened.

"You're being unreasonable!" He gritted his teeth.

Olivia: "Oh."

"Worse than a fuckboy!"

Olivia: "Oh."

"Bully!"

"Oh."

Finally, Julian put on his clothes and slammed the door on his way out.

Damn—

Play with fire and get burned!

Olivia Lopez!

You're ruthless!
###Chapter 265

Olivia Lopez glanced at the messy dishes on the table.

She frowned.

She should have made that man clean up before leaving.

She made a call.

"Schedule a housekeeper for two hours."

"Full house cleaning."

"Focus on the sofa."

Julian Winston slammed the door shut behind him.

He sped down the road at ninety miles per hour.

He stormed into his apartment.

Tore off his clothes.

Stepped into the shower.

The water rushed over his body.

But it couldn't wash away her scent.

Faint yet persistent.

Lingering in his nostrils.

He kicked the sofa.

Thump—

Images flashed in his mind.

Entangled on the couch.

Wild in the bedroom.

That woman was all fire and passion last night.

This morning, cold as ice.

She ate the instant noodles he cooked.

Then completely dismissed him.

He kicked the sofa again.

A dull thud echoed.

"Even you're against me?"

He pulled out his phone.

Blocked all her contacts.

Tossed the phone onto the sofa.

The doorbell suddenly rang.

Julian's heart skipped a beat.

Hmph. Coming to apologize now?

She'll have to beg.

Plead softly.

Then he might consider forgiving her.

He yanked the door open.

"Do you know you were wron—"

Isabella Langley stood at the doorway.

She smiled gently.

"Wrong about what?"

Julian's heart sank.

"Mom. Why are you here?"

"Who else were you expecting? Olivia? She said you weren't with her."

Julian collapsed onto the sofa.

Listless.

"Why do you look so dejected?"

"I'm not."

"You sound completely drained."

Julian turned his face away.

"What do you need?"

Isabella took out a jewelry box.

Laid the pieces out in a row.

"Give these to Olivia. Say they're from me."

Julian frowned.

"She might not even want them."

"Don't be ridiculous."

Isabella glared at him.

"She's the daughter-in-law I've chosen."

Julian's nose tingled.

He turned around, crossing his arms.

"She has high standards. I don't meet them."

"Olivia has every right to pursue something better."

Isabella nodded.

"You're just lying there like a lazy snake."

Julian bristled.

"I'm your own son!"

"I know. Don't break my heart."

She pushed the jewelry box toward him.

"Give these to Olivia soon."

Julian stayed silent.

Isabella pinched his ear.

"Did you hear me?"

"Ouch! Yes, I heard!"

"Bring Olivia to the tea tasting next weekend."

Julian's eyes darted away.

"Is that necessary?"

"You must bring her."

Isabella picked up her purse and stood.

"Remember to call her."

The door closed.

Julian's head throbbed with pain.

Olivia Lopez continued her usual routine.

Work.

Clubbing.

Playing tennis.

Life went on as normal.

Except for one thing.

Nina White called.

"Vivi, bring Julian Winston home to meet us."

Olivia held the phone away from her ear.

"The signal's bad. Let's talk later."

She hung up.

Smooth and effortless.

She stared at her cocktail.

Ms. Nina White was very pleased with Julian.

Too bad it's over.

Finding the next suitable partner would be hard.

She should have held back that night.

Lost a high-quality collaborator.

Sophia Sullivan knew nothing about this.

Professor Eleanor Watson had taken her to a conference in Shanghai.

They returned after five days.

She went straight to the lab.

The door was locked.

Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence sat in the hallway.

They looked like two lost puppies.
###Chapter 266

Sophia Sullivan approached.

They both looked up at the same time.

Their eyes were like lost children finally finding their family.

Hannah Morse rushed over.

Her eyes instantly reddened.

Marcus Lawrence followed behind her.

His fists were clenched tightly.

Sophia's heart sank.

She remained calm. "What happened? Why aren't you inside?"

"Sophia..." Hannah's voice choked with emotion. "We're locked out!"

"Locked out?" Sophia was stunned.

"A surprise inspection team showed up yesterday. They said it was a random fire safety check..."

They cooperated and opened the door.

The staff walked around inside and out a few times.

Finally, they handed over a rectification order.

It demanded they vacate within one week.

Hannah trembled with anger. "The lab next door had an inspection last week. It was just a formality. Why do we have to rectify?"

The new lab had just been set up.

The CPRT Dynamometer was just activated.

Could it really be gone just like that?

Sophia asked calmly, "Where are the keys?"

Marcus replied, "Director Blake took them. He said we need to go through a self-inspection process."

Sophia took out her spare key.

She opened the door and went inside.

The two followed her.

Sophia offered them bottled water.

Hannah shook her head. "Sophia, 'rectification' is just a disguised eviction. Are we going to lose this place?"

Sophia reached out her hand. "Let me see the order."

Marcus retrieved the rectification order from a drawer.

Sophia quickly scanned it.

There were two issues listed.

Missing fire safety equipment.

Improper electrical usage.

Her gaze sharpened.

These hazards did indeed exist.

But every lab in the entire institute was short on equipment.

Why were they the only ones inspected?

The electrical issue was even more ridiculous.

The instruments were in standby mode, not completely powered off.

Hannah felt wronged. "We're right here. We use the instruments at anytime. Cutting the power is completely unnecessary."

Sophia stood up. "Let's check across the hall."

Hannah was confused. "What does the lab across the hall have to do with us?"

Marcus pulled her along. "Don't ask. You'll see when we look."

The three walked to the lab opposite theirs.

Fire safety equipment was fully stocked along the wall.

Hannah's eyes widened. "They didn't have any of that last month!"

They checked several more labs.

All were fully equipped.

Only their lab was excluded.

A chill ran down Hannah's spine. "Is this targeted at us?"

Sophia gave a cold laugh.

She directly took them to find the Vice Dean.

Blake Cunningham recognized the three of them.

Especially Sophia Sullivan.

The genius student with the first-author paper in "Science".

He smiled warmly. "What can I do for you, Miss Sullivan?"

Sophia got straight to the point. "Our lab received a rectification order. Are you aware of this?"

Blake nodded. "I am. Is there a problem?"

"Why is our lab the only one in the entire institute missing equipment? And why were we the ones randomly selected for inspection?"

Blake frowned. "What are you implying?"

Sophia looked directly at him. "If something happens in the lab, the institute is liable. You wouldn't create trouble for yourself. But someone else might be setting a trap behind the scenes."

"When that happens, we'll all fall into the pit together."

Blake's expression shifted slightly. "What are you suggesting?"

"I suggest you investigate whether these coincidences are truly accidental or deliberately orchestrated."

Having said that, she led the others away.

Blake sat in his chair.

He was silent for a long time.

He picked up his phone and dialed a number.

"Come to my office... Now!"

...

Hannah was still confused. "Sophia, I still don't understand..."

Marcus glanced at her. "Why were only we inspected?"

Hannah looked blank. "Why?"

"Because someone reported us."

...

Blake stared coldly at the woman before him.

His voice was icy as he demanded, "Was it you?"
###Chapter 267

Professor Victoria Lowell  crossed her arms, her posture haughty. "What complaint?"

"Don't play dumb! The fire inspection passed smoothly for all other labs. Only Sophia Sullivan's received a rectification order. You dare say it wasn't you?"

A slight smile touched Professor Victoria Lowell 's lips. "I'm very busy. Writing reports and conducting research takes all my time. I have no time to squabble with students." She paused. "But... I can't speak for what others might have done."

After all, she supervised many students. It was normal if one or two held a grudge against Sophia.

"You've grown bold. Acting without my permission. Do you still see me as the Dean?!"

Professor Victoria Lowell  frowned. "You called me here for this? To stand up for Eleanor Watson's students? That doesn't sound like you, Dean Cunningham."

Blake Cunningham gave a cold laugh. "You think your little schemes are clever? They're utterly foolish!"

"This fire inspection was a joint operation between the university and the district fire department. How you usually exclude them behind closed doors is your business. But this involves the district fire authorities. Your complaint drags the entire school into this!"

One lab requiring rectification meant the school bore responsibility for managerial negligence.

Fire equipment was typically procured by individual labs. The school was responsible for verifying its adequacy before approving lab use.

This problem now indicated a failure in the school's oversight.

"Still think you're clever?" Blake sneered. "If other leadership found out…"

Professor Victoria Lowell 's expression shifted.

"I've suppressed it this time. Cause less trouble in the future!"

Professor Victoria Lowell  shed her earlier arrogance, hesitating. "What do we do now? Can we ask the district fire department for a favor? To let it slide?"

"You think the fire department is your personal property? File a complaint, then just withdraw it?"

Professor Victoria Lowell  pressed, "Then... we do nothing?"

Blake replied, "Since the rectification order was issued, they must follow procedure and rectify."

What was done was done. They had to proceed.

As for Sebastian Evans and Alexander Laurent...

The order came from the district fire department. The complaint came from Professor Victoria Lowell . The blame couldn't possibly land on him.

Blake Cunningham smiled.

Professor Victoria Lowell  also smiled.

Fire safety rectification...

It would take at least three to four months, right?

By then, it would be far too late.

...

In the lab—

Marcus Lawrence ended the call, his expression grave as he looked at Sophia.

Hannah Morse urgently asked, "Well?"

"Just as we guessed. The district fire department confirmed a complaint was filed. A standard rectification might be resolved in twenty days. But an order issued following a complaint requires a process of at least four months. The lab cannot be used during rectification. It can only be returned after passing the fire safety inspection."

"Four months?!" Hannah's eyes widened. "We'd be on winter break by then! What use is it to us then?"

They couldn't afford to lose a single day, let alone four months.

Marcus pondered, "Can we apply for a different lab? We could move the instruments. It's a hassle, but better than waiting idly."

Sophia shook her head. She had already considered this. "The administration replied half an hour ago. Each research group can only apply for one lab at a time."

"Nothing works! What do we do?" Hannah's eyes reddened with frustration. "We can't just build our own lab, can we?"

"Well, well—someone wants to build a lab? Let me hear who's talking nonsense in broad daylight?"

Ashley Lowell walked in, face full of triumph.

Shane Holloway followed, grinning. "Who else? Must be the fat girl, sleep-talking with her eyes closed."

Fat... fat girl?!

Hannah charged forward, but Marcus spoke first—

"Who let you in? Our lab isn't welcome to two-legged beasts. Get out now, before we make you."

"Who the hell are you calling a beast?!" Shane's face flushed red with anger.

Marcus said calmly, "Whoever the shoe fits. Seems one beast immediately identified itself."

"You—"

Ashley sneered. "What are you so proud of? The whole school passed except your lab. You're utterly humiliated, yet still so mouthy!"

"I hear fire rectifications take months. Tsk, tsk... such a pity. You'll have no lab for a long time. So what if you published in 'Science'? The school still doesn't value you. What are you strutting about for?"

Sophia smiled. "I didn't want to say this, afraid you couldn't handle it. But then I thought, showing mercy to beasts is being cruel to myself. So I feel no burden now."

"Yes, I published in 'Science'. So what? You haven't published at all, have you? You're jealous, right? Unfortunately, academic strength isn't gained through jealousy. If you can't, you can't. A sharp tongue is useless. Don't you agree?"

"You—"

Sophia looked her over. "Actually, I've always been curious. With your idle ways, always chasing drama, where do you find time for experiments and papers? Anyone with real academic output spends day and night in the lab. You're the only one so free. So free it makes me wonder..."

She paused, taking in Ashley's subtle reaction. "...if you even wrote those papers yourself."

"You— nonsense! Who do you think you are?! You only see me when I'm free, not when I'm pushing progress in the lab..."

Sophia cut in, "Pushing progress, or playing on your phone?"

"I've done so many experiments, produced so many reports..."

Sophia asked, "Then tell me, what value does the POT parameter display on the C-xp coordinate display? What is the domain? What is the approximate range of the interval parameters?"

Ashley stared blankly.

She heard each word, but together, they made no sense.

Sophia pressed, "You don't even know such basic operations? And you claim you've done many experiments? Produced many reports?"

Alarm bells rang in Ashley's mind. The other's gaze seemed to see through all her secrets.

"I—I won't waste words on you! You have one week to move out. After rectification, this lab might not be yours anymore!"

She turned and left, her retreating figure flustered.

Shane stammered, "Wait..." That was it?

Weren't they going to show them? It was over just like that?

"I'm not stooping to your level today. We'll see about the future!" Shane snorted coldly and hurried after her.

The two nuisances were gone, but the trio's mood remained heavy.

Hannah said, "From what Ashley said, even if we pass inspection, they have a plan to take the lab. If that's true, maybe we shouldn't even bother rectifying! I'd rather we can't use it than let them have it!"

Better to break the jade than preserve the tile.

Marcus stated, "The priority now is solving the lab problem. Perhaps... we could borrow from another research group? Or rent? We can pay?"

Hannah shook her head. "It sounds possible, but it's too difficult. Who would lend us their lab?"

They weren't relatives or close friends. No one needed the money that badly.

"If you don't mind, you can use my laboratory."

A magnetic voice suddenly spoke.

All three looked toward the door.

Hannah gasped.

"Professor Laurent?!"
###Chapter 268

Alexander Laurent had classes in the morning.

During the break, he overheard two students discussing the fire safety inspection at the School of Life Sciences lab.

He hadn't paid much attention at first.

Until he heard Sophia Sullivan's name.

He immediately stood up and headed for the School of Life Sciences lab.

He arrived just in time to hear the conversation between Sophia and the other two.

"Professor." Sophia sounded surprised. "What brings you here?"

Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence quickly greeted him as well.

Alexander glanced at the fire safety violation notice. "The rectification will take at least two months. You can use my lab for now. Move the equipment over. There's enough space."

This suggestion made both Hannah and Marcus look at Sophia.

They were used to her making the decisions.

Sophia was silent for a moment.

She ultimately declined politely.

...

The sky was getting darker earlier these days.

Night had just begun to fall.

The small restaurant by the street was bustling with noise and activity.

Alexander looked at Sophia sitting across from him. "Why did you refuse?"

They had walked home together after leaving the lab.

Sophia was too hungry to cook.

So she picked this popular little place.

Alexander offered to treat her.

Sophia didn't refuse.

They had to wait in line for ten minutes to get a seat.

As soon as they sat down, Alexander couldn't help but ask.

Sophia sighed softly. "You've already helped me so many times. Some paths I have to walk on my own. Can you help me for a lifetime?"

Alexander's Adam's apple moved.

He almost blurted out "Yes."

But he held back in the end.

Sophia continued. "The conflicts with the administration and other professors are unavoidable. If I avoid it this time, what about next time? It's better to resolve it completely now."

Some people only learn their lesson after facing consequences.

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "Do you have a plan?"

"I have some ideas. I still need to think it through."

Alexander nodded. "Let me know if you need any help."

"Okay."

What Sophia didn't say was that Alexander's lab wasn't really suitable for long-term use by outsiders.

She knew all too well how cliquish research groups could be.

Besides, a borrowed place was never a permanent solution.

...

They walked home after the meal.

The night wind was bitingly cold.

Sophia's hair was tousled by the wind.

She tried to smooth it down several times without success.

Alexander stepped forward, positioning himself to block the wind for her.

"Thank you."

Sophia lowered her head to fix her hair.

Suddenly, a warm coat was draped over her shoulders.

"Wear it. Don't catch a cold."

He quickly withdrew his hand and stepped back.

The action was restrained and polite.

Sophia was slightly taken aback. "What about you?"

Alexander said, "I'm not cold."

"...Thank you."

As they reached the entrance of the alley, Alexander suddenly ducked into a convenience store.

He soon came out holding two hot drinks.

"Here."

Sophia took the paper cup. "What is this?"

"Ginger black tea."

Sophia was curious. "This store sells this?"

She had never seen it before.

Alexander said, "It's a seasonal limited edition. Just launched."

"Is yours the same?"

Alexander shook his head. "Buckwheat tea."

Sophia held the warm drink.

His coat was draped over her shoulders.

She felt warm all over.

A faint blush colored her cheeks.

After going upstairs, Sophia took off the coat and handed it back.

"Thank you, Professor. Goodnight."

The corner of his mouth lifted slightly. "Goodnight."

They went to their respective homes.

After her shower, Sophia put on a knit cardigan to read research papers.

She felt warm and cozy.

Her phone rang.

It was a call from David Sullivan.

"Dad."

"Are you asleep, Clara?"

"Still reading papers."

"Don't stay up too late. It's cold. Remember to wear more clothes."

"I know. The heating is on. How's Mom?"

David Sullivan said, "Working on her manuscript. I sent you some marinated beef. It'll arrive tomorrow."

"That much? I won't be able to finish it."

David Sullivan said, "Share half with Alexander. You're right across from each other. It's convenient."

Meanwhile, as Alexander was hanging up his coat at home, he paused.

He took the coat back down.

It still carried her scent.

He unconsciously brought it closer and took a light breath.

Then he suddenly came to his senses.

A look of annoyance flashed in his eyes.

He tossed the coat onto the sofa and quickly walked into the bathroom.

Cold water rushed down.

...

The next morning, Sophia received the package.

She went to knock on Alexander's door.

"Professor, are you there?"

The door opened quickly.

Alexander seemed to have just woken up.

He was wearing pajamas, his hair slightly disheveled.

Sophia was startled. "Did I wake you?"

It was almost ten o'clock.

According to his usual schedule, he should have been up long ago.

"Are you okay, Professor?" She noticed he looked pale.

"No... cough... I'm fine..."

Sophia raised an eyebrow, studying him.

She clearly didn't believe him.

Alexander fell silent.

Sophia asked, "Are you sick?"

"Just a slight cold."

She lowered her eyes. "Because you lent me your coat yesterday..."

"No! I was already coughing a bit before. Probably caught a chill from staying up late."

"Did you take any medicine?"

Alexander nodded. "Yes. Don't worry."

Sophia relaxed. "My dad sent some marinated beef. He specifically said to give you half."

"Your father is too kind."

Sophia suddenly laughed.

Alexander asked, "What's so funny?"

"Really want to know?"

"You're laughing like that. Not telling me would just make me more curious."

Sophia took out three vacuum-sealed packs of marinated beef from the box, packed them up, and handed them to him. "You call him 'Uncle,' but on the phone, he said to give more to 'Uncle Alexander,' as a way to show respect to an elder."

Alexander: "..."
###Chapter 269
Sophia Sullivan couldn't help but laugh at his exasperated expression.

"Take it, Uncle Alexander—my dad's braised beef is amazing. Most people never get to try it."

"What did you just call me?" He stepped closer, bracing an arm against the wall. "Hmm?"

Her back pressed against the wall as she looked up at him. "I was just quoting my dad. It's not like I chose to call you that."

"..."

"Professor, the hallway is narrow. Could you... step back a little?"

Alexander Laurent remembered he was still recovering from a cold. Not wanting to risk getting her sick, he sighed softly and withdrew his arm, moving aside.

Once again, Sophia was struck by how patient he seemed.

He accepted the container of beef.

She took the rest home and sent a photo to David Sullivan.

He replied instantly.

David Sullivan: [Did you give some to Alexander?]

Sophia Sullivan: [Yes! Dad, you treat him better than you treat me!]

He hadn't even told her to save more for herself.

David Sullivan skipped typing and sent a voice message. "Of course! That's how you treat a good friend! You share the good stuff!"

Sophia thought Alexander should hear that.

...She hadn't said anything wrong earlier, so why had he cornered her like that?

The memory of him blocking her path, his presence overwhelming, flashed through her mind.

His scent had enveloped her completely.

Her face grew warm.

Her heart began to race.

Back in high school, boys would sometimes get too close, and she'd always blush.

Before she met Ethan Roscente, any physical proximity to guys made her uncomfortable, even uneasy.

She thought dating would fix that, but...

It seemed she was regressing. The old reaction was back!

She dismissed it as a recurring issue, not delving deeper.

...

That afternoon, she invited Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence over.

"...to discuss the lab situation."

"Okay."

"On my way!"

They arrived quickly. Hannah wore fluffy slippers. Marcus was in loungewear.

Both had come straight from their homes.

"Sophia, do you have a plan?" Hannah asked eagerly the moment she stepped inside.

Marcus looked at her with equal anticipation.

Sophia handed them drinks and sat down, her expression serious.

"First, waiting months for the official process is unrealistic. Our research can't wait. The experiments definitely can't."

"Second, even if we wait, there's no guarantee we'll get the lab back. We might just face new problems."

"Professor Laurent previously invited us to use his space... I've thought it over. Borrowing a lab from another department means unsuitable equipment. Navigating their social dynamics would also drain our energy. If we want to leave after a couple of days, moving all the equipment again would be a huge hassle."

"Finally, borrowing isn't a long-term solution. Someone set us up this time. They're hidden, we're exposed. 
###Chapter 270

If we don't tackle the root cause, we'll just have more trouble later..."

The light in Hannah's eyes dimmed. She slumped onto the sofa.

She looked utterly defeated.

Marcus frowned deeply. "Is there really no other way?"

Just as Sophia was about to speak, Hannah suddenly exploded.

"What a rotten institute! So corrupt! We've been wronged, and the administration turns a blind eye! Why? Just because we borrowed a lab? Then fine, let's not borrow! It's just a crummy room anyway. My dad has plenty of properties!"

"Just because my dad owns buildings—countless buildings! He's always been the one evicting people. No one evicts him!"

"Things only feel secure when they're your own. That's when you can stand tall! The institute lends us a dump. No CPRT equipment, incomplete safety gear. We kill ourselves to produce results, and the institute takes the credit?"

"Since when does that happen? I call bullshit—"

The young landlady had never been treated so unfairly.

"What's the big deal? A crummy room, and we bought the equipment ourselves!"

Her temper was quick to ignite.

She ranted furiously, her words flying. Marcus and Sophia stared, stunned.

"Um... did I scare you?" Embarrassment flickered across Hannah's round face. She hurried to explain, "I'm not usually like this, really. I just occasionally lose my temper and can't stop... ahem!"

Marcus swallowed. "..."

Sophia, however, looked thrilled, nodding vigorously. "Hannah's right! As long as the lab is borrowed, we have no control."

The institute could reclaim it anytime, find fault anytime, lend it to anyone they pleased.

They were just meat on the chopping block, completely vulnerable.

"So... we don't borrow from the institute anymore?" Hannah ventured tentatively.

Sophia nodded.

Marcus asked, "Then where do we borrow from?"

Sophia replied, "Why borrow? Like Hannah said, why don't we just build our own?"

B-build one?

Marcus was completely dumbfounded.

Hannah was stunned for a second, then jumped up excitedly.

"Right! We can build our own!"

Their own lab. No worries about it being taken back. No fear of petty people targeting them.

Sophia said, "I've checked MIT's rules and the School of Life Sciences regulations. There's no prohibition against students building independent labs. As long as we have all the proper permits and meet the qualifications, it's allowed."

Hannah immediately raised her hand. "I can provide funding! How much? Five million? Ten million?"

Marcus was baffled. What kind of conversation was this?

Sophia thought for a moment. "I can contribute funding too. And also... a piece of land."

Hannah exclaimed, "!"

Marcus was shocked. "?!"

"Sophia, you own land?"

"Yes." Sophia smiled. "Plot 3-5, Block 72, East. It's still undeveloped."

Even Hannah, the young landlady, couldn't help but gulp.

Land...

Not a house. Not a commercial space. Land!

They could build whatever they wanted on it!

"Sophia, how many more surprises do you have?!"

Sophia chuckled. "Now that funding and land are settled, there's just one final hurdle."

"What is it?"

"Approvals."

You can't just build a lab, especially a bio lab, without permission.

Microorganisms, particularly viruses, pose biosafety risks. Using organic solvents in experiments requires considering waste disposal.

If radioactive materials are involved, there are national regulations...

In short, the various approvals and paperwork are the hardest part!

A single delay in the process could set them back a year or more. Forget building the lab; they could harvest several seasons of vegetables on that land in that time.

Hannah said, "This requires connections, doesn't it?"

Sophia nodded.

"Um..." Marcus, who had been quiet, suddenly spoke up. "Maybe I can try."

"!"
Both of them turned to look at Marcus Lawrence.

He awkwardly rubbed the back of his head.

"Why are you both looking at me like that?"

Hannah Morse's gaze turned inquisitive. "Marcus, what does your family actually do?"

Sophia Sullivan added softly, "I remember you mentioned before that your parents are civil servants?"

It seemed these civil servants were not ordinary.

She wisely stopped the conversation there, not probing further.

Though Hannah was straightforward, she knew her boundaries.

She'd heard that kids from certain special family backgrounds tended to be very low-key. His previous evasiveness was understandable.

She tactfully didn't press further.

Marcus visibly relaxed.

"I'll do my best to handle this."

"Good."

Hannah raised her fist. "For the lab—"

Marcus raised his hand too. "For not getting kicked out again—"

They both turned to Sophia.

She was slightly taken aback and instinctively added, "Go for it?"

"Go for it!!!"

...

The three of them immediately split up to take action.

Hannah pulled out her phone to make a call as soon as she left the building.

"Pops~ Have you eaten yet?"

"Finished! How about you?"

"Not yet..." Her voice suddenly took on a sob.

He MinSheng immediately sensed something was wrong.

For his precious daughter to skip a meal, it must be something serious.

"Tell me quickly, what's going on?"

Hannah poured out the whole story about the lab's ordeal.

"...It's just too much!"

Smack!

He MinSheng slammed the table. "Outrageous! The university turns a blind eye to what it should manage and protects what it shouldn't! This is the conduct of a prestigious institution?"

"Exactly!" Hannah nodded vigorously. "Pops, you don't know, when I said I'd build my own lab, those two students from Professor Victoria Lowell's team laughed at me for daydreaming and even called me fat... Boo hoo..."

"What?! They dared call you fat?! Sweetie, you're not fat at all, this is called having good fortune! We don't bother with those ignorant people."

"Hmph! It's just a lab, right? With money, anything can be built! Let them see what real capability means, what a slap in the face looks like!"

"So, Dad, you agree?!"

Hannah's voice shot up with excitement, all traces of grievance gone.

He MinSheng paused. "...Agree to what?"

"Agree to build the lab for us!"

?!

"Dad? You just said yes..."

He MinSheng suddenly understood. "You led me in circles just to ask for this?"

"Hehe..." Hannah laughed. "It really won't cost much, honestly! Just a tiny bit!"

"How much is a tiny bit?"

"Probably... around ten million."

"Ten million is fine... What?! Ten million?! A lab costs that much?"

That was enough to build three buildings back in his hometown!

The monthly rent alone would be over a hundred thousand...

"Sweetie, don't get scammed! There are so many fraud cases lately..." He stood up abruptly, worried his naive daughter might be targeted by bad people.

Fraud...

Hannah was utterly speechless.

"Dad, it's not a scam. Sophia is contributing even more than me! She's even providing the land. That's solid, tangible land!"

A long silence followed on the other end. "...You're really building the lab yourselves?"

"Of course!"

"Not just a spur-of-the-moment thing?"

Hannah: "We're dead serious!"

"Alright, ten million, right? Transferring it to your card now!"

"Wow—Thanks, Dad! Love you, mwah~"

"Hehe..." The doting father chuckled foolishly.

That night, Hannah posted the transfer screenshot in the three-person group chat.

Seven glaring zeros were particularly eye-catching.

Hannah Morse: [Done~]

...

Marcus looked at that "~" and couldn't help but smile, easily imagining her proud little expression when sending it.

Seems like he needed to step up his game too.

He put away his phone and walked to the sofa. "Grandpa, it's been a while since we played chess. How about a game?"

"Sure! It's rare for you to come back. No one ever plays seriously with me anymore."

The old man got up with his cane and sat down before the chessboard.

Two rounds later, he was thoroughly enjoying the battle!

Marcus subtly let him win, delighting the old man.

"Marcus, not in top form today?"

Marcus sighed, feigning distress. "It's clearly that your skills have improved. Honestly, have you been practicing in secret?"

Flattery never fails.

Sure enough, "Hahahaha..."

The old man laughed heartily.

Marcus: "No, no, another game!"

This time, he didn't go easy and naturally won.

The old man snorted, complaining childishly. "And you said I practiced? Clearly, you're better! Not playing anymore, no fun!"

After a pause, he spoke again. "It's not the holidays. Why the sudden visit home? And offering to play chess? Spit it out, what trouble are you in?"

"Ahem!"

As expected, nothing escaped the old man's sharp eyes.

Marcus truthfully explained the academic bullying and suppression he'd faced at school.

"...Rather than putting up with it, it's better to start fresh! We want to build our own lab. We have the money and the land now, all that's left is the approval process..."

Here, he paused, sneaking a glance at the old man's expression.

He might as well have written "I've made it so obvious, please say yes" on his face.

Yet the old man remained silent.

He just sat upright, his gaze profound.

Marcus didn't dare rush him, silently tidying the chessboard, his heart aching...

After what felt like an eternity, the old man suddenly sighed. "I never thought the academic world could become so corrupt... If it's truly as you say, I support you starting fresh."

"The approval process... Go ahead and do it. Don't worry about the rest."

"Thank you, Grandpa!"

"Remember—do it well, don't give up halfway and become a laughingstock!"

"Mm! Don't worry!"

Marcus's side, though with some twists, was ultimately resolved perfectly.

That night, he also followed Hannah's lead in the group chat: [Done~]

Meanwhile, Sophia, who should have had the smoothest sailing, unexpectedly ran into trouble…
###Chapter 271

Sophia Sullivan looked at the staff member.

"The transfer requires the assignor's signature?"

The other person nodded.

"The subject matter is too significant. Even with the transfer contract, we need a signed letter of informed consent from the assignor."

Sophia's fingers tightened.

Which meant she needed Ethan Roscente's signature.

...

Ethan Roscente stepped out of the elevator.

His assistant approached him.

"Good morning, Mr. Roscente."

"The investors' meeting at nine to discuss the Qian Yuan Foods capital injection. A meeting with Mr. Wei from Huashang at ten to discuss cooperation. Department reports at eleven. Golf with Mr. Li from Eurasia this afternoon."

The assistant spoke at a steady pace.

He finished his report just as Ethan pushed open his office door.

Ethan paused.

"Cancel the investors' meeting. Tell Wei Xianhua I only have half an hour. If his proposal lacks sincerity, there's no need to talk."

"Understood."

A freshly brewed coffee sat on the office desk.

Ethan tested its temperature.

Perfect.

He picked up the cup and walked to the floor-to-ceiling window.

He took only one sip before setting it down.

He had practiced for so long.

But he still couldn't replicate her taste.

The same coffee beans.

The same coffee machine.

Even the same mug.

Why did it taste wrong?

A year had passed.

He still wasn't used to her absence.

The coffee was wrong.

The oatmeal porridge was wrong.

The salsa was wrong.

The living room was wrong.

The bedroom was wrong.

Everything was wrong.

He let out a bitter laugh.

A knock sounded at the door.

"Come in."

The assistant brought in breakfast.

He quietly exited.

Ethan had little appetite.

He forced himself to eat a little.

The entire morning was spent in meetings, reviewing reports, and approving documents.

Day after day.

Like a working machine.

At least there used to be a home to return to.

Now, going back meant an empty mansion.

It no longer felt like a home.

Because the person who left the light on late at night was gone.

In the afternoon, Ethan picked up his jacket, ready to leave.

The assistant entered, looking excited.

"Mr. Roscente, Soph—"

"Reserve a table at Huatai Lou. We'll go after the game." Ethan cut him off.

The assistant hesitated.

"Okay. Mr. Roscente, Miss S—"

Ethan interrupted again.

"Mr. Li prefers light flavors, no seafood. Be mindful when ordering."

"Right."

Ethan finished putting on his suit and suddenly looked up.

"What were you trying to say earlier?"

"Miss Sullivan is here! She's right outside!"

He finally got it out.

"Miss Sullivan? Who?" Ethan was momentarily confused.

"Sophia Sullivan!" The assistant was practically stomping his foot in urgency.

The person he thought about every day was right outside.

Yet he seemed indifferent.

Ethan wasn't indifferent.

He simply couldn't believe it.

"What did you say?!"

"Miss Sophia Sullivan is here. Should I ask her to come in?"

"Is that even a question?!" Ethan confirmed it wasn't an auditory hallucination.

Sophia was here!

During their relationship, she rarely came to the company.

Every excuse to work overtime had successfully fooled her.

"Aren't you going to ask her in?!"

"Right! I'll go—"

"Never mind. I'll go myself."

...

Sophia stood near the assistant's workstation.

Not far away was a full-length window.

She walked to the window and looked down at the traffic below.

Ahead was the commercial street.

To the left and right were office buildings.

In the distance, the river view was visible.

This was prime real estate.

When the company was first founded, there was no money and no connections.

The office was in a residential apartment above a rented basement.

Two bedrooms and a living room.

It had a window and a small kitchen.

But it was very simple.

The startup was small.

Besides Ethan, there were only five technical employees.

There was no money to hire a receptionist, accountant, cashier, or HR.

Sophia handled everything herself.

Running up and down the stairs every day.

Only taking the bus for errands.

Buying groceries and cooking to save on delivery costs.

Those times were hard.

But her heart was fervent.

Everyone regretted her decision to give up the combined Master's and Ph.D. program.

She desperately wanted to prove her choice wasn't wrong.

She hadn't climbed the academic peak.

But she had a reliable lover and a flourishing business.

In the future, there would be a happy family and lovely children.

Ethan went well.

Those two years, he devoted himself entirely to work.

Working from dawn to dusk.

He even took her on dates during holidays.

Ethan could detect any change in Sophia's mood immediately and respond promptly.

When did it start to change?

The third year of the startup, the company developed rapidly.

Business expanded crazily, making more and more money.

The office moved from the residential apartment to a small villa in the near suburbs.

Half a year later, it relocated to an old office building within the third ring road.

Two months before the IPO, it moved to the current building.

After that, Sophia seldom came to his workplace.

Ethan was happy about it.

He found her delaying meetings and cooperation.

"Bringing food?"

"Why bring food?"

"The company has a cafeteria."

"You can also order delivery!"

"You worry too much. Find time to go shopping, buy bags and jewelry. Have afternoon tea with Mrs. Omelas and Mrs. Li, arrange flowers, chat."

Hearing this, Sophia was stunned for a long time.

It was the first time she realized her plans and the role Ethan had arranged for her were different.

Polar opposites.

She wanted to be a tree standing side by side, weathering storms together.

He wanted her to be a delicate flower blooming under the tree's shade, forever obedient and dependent.

After that, Sophia completely withdrew, no longer involved in company affairs.

The company didn't need her anymore.

There was money to hire more professional people for reception, accounting, and finance.

Ethan became busier, flying all over the world, gone for half a month at a time.

When he had free time, he organized golf games to meet new connections or went drinking and playing cards with Sebastian Evans, Charlie Lowell, and Julian Winston.

During the countless nights waiting alone for his return, Sophia recalled the early days of the startup.

She felt a growing disconnect, as if the man now and the man in her memory were becoming two different people.

Sophia stared into the distance, her thoughts adrift, until—

"Sophia!"
###Chapter 272
Sophia Sullivan turned abruptly.

Ethan Roscente stood at the door.

His suit was impeccably tailored.

He had lost weight.

The line of his jaw was sharper.

His gaze was intense.

Sophia wore a beige knit sweater under a trench coat.

Her dark hair fell softly.

She wore no makeup.

She looked as pure as fresh snow.

"Hello," she spoke first.

Ethan felt a pang in his chest.

"Sophia... must we be so formal?"

A faint smile touched her lips.

She said nothing.

Ethan's Adam's apple bobbed. "You needed to see me?"

"Yes."

"Shall we go inside?"

"Alright."

She walked toward the office.

Ethan followed closely.

The door closed.

Shutting out the outside world.

"Liam! Who was that?" a new assistant peeked out.

Liam Evans frowned. "Mind your own business."

Everyone fell silent.

Liam knocked.

"Mr. Roscente, the golf game this afternoon..."

"Cancel it."

"Yes, sir."

Inside the office.

Ethan pulled out a chair.

"Something to drink?"

"No, let's get to business."

He sat down.

His eyes traced her profile.

"I came today to..."

"How are your studies?" he interrupted. "I heard MIT grad school is tough."

She remained patient. "It's manageable."

She tried again. "Regarding the deed of acknowledgment for that land..."

"Have you eaten?" he cut her off again. "There's a French restaurant nearby you used to like."

Sophia pressed her lips together.

She nodded.

Ethan immediately stood up.

He called to cancel his evening plans.

At the restaurant.

He deftly cut the steak.

He pushed the plate toward her.

"You always hated this part," he said lightly.

Sophia didn't touch her cutlery.

"I brought the documents. You just need to sign."

Ethan's smile faded.

"Is having one meal with me so difficult?"

"You said we could talk over dinner."

He set down his knife and fork.

"You wouldn't be here if I didn't need to sign, would you?"

"Correct."

His eyes darkened. "Is that all I'm worth to you now?"

"We ended things a long time ago."

"What if I refuse to sign?"

Sophia met his gaze calmly. "The land is already transferred. The contract is legally binding."

"I regret it," his voice grew heavy.

He regretted letting go.

He regretted letting her leave.

Sophia frowned. "This isn't a parting gift. It's the compensation I'm owed."

The paperwork was nearly complete.

Only his signature was missing.

"You have no claim. Refusing is pointless."

Ethan's gaze turned cold. "So we're at an impasse?"

"The choice is yours."

"And if I choose not to?"

Sophia held his stare. "We can negotiate terms."

She leaned forward slightly.

"State your demands. Be direct."
###Chapter 273

Ethan Roscente's gaze was heavy on her face.

Deep, turbulent emotions swirled in his eyes.

"What I want, you've always known."

Sophia Sullivan frowned deeply.

"It's simple. Come back to me. Forget the agreement. I'll give you anything you want."

"Absolutely not!"

Her reply was resolute.

"Sophia…" The man let out a bitter laugh. "I know you must think I'm despicable right now. But I truly can't lose you… Give me another chance, please? I promise, it will only be you from now on. I'll change everything you don't like. Just believe in me one more time, alright?"

He reached out to take Sophia's hand.

She swiftly pulled away.

Sophia: "I won't believe a single word you say. And I will never agree to your demands."

She collected the documents and pen. "I shouldn't have come today. If you don't want to sign, then forget it."

With that, she turned and walked away.

Her steps were quick and urgent.

Even though she had long given up hope on him, hearing those words firsthand still shocked her with the audacity of the man she once loved.

Outside the restaurant, Sophia walked to the curb to hail a taxi.

Before she could open the door, her wrist was seized by the man who had chased after her.

The driver, seeing the altercation, assumed they were arguing and immediately drove off.

"What are you doing? Ethan Roscente!"

"Just walking away without a word, leaving me behind, always just watching your back. Sophia Sullivan, you're so good at tormenting me!"

"So it's all my fault? You, the great young master Roscente, are never wrong, always justified? Go home, Ethan Roscente. Let your mother spoil you. I have no such obligation!"

The man's face darkened. He gripped her hand tightly, his breathing uneven as he struggled to suppress his anger.

"Let me take you home."

Sophia: "No, I can get back myself."

"Do you have to be so stubborn?"

"Hah. I simply don't want to see you."

Ethan reached for her again—

"She said she doesn't want to. Didn't you hear?" Sebastian Evans suddenly appeared, stepping between them, shielding Sophia.

Their eyes met. Sebastian's gaze was sharp and imposing. Ethan met it coldly, unwilling to back down.

"This is between her and me. You'd better not interfere!"

Sebastian smirked. "Her business is my business. I will interfere. What can you do about it?"

"What are you? What right do you have to interfere?!"

Sebastian: "Not sure what I am, but definitely more important than you."

Ethan: "…"

Sebastian turned to Sophia, his voice instantly softening. "Are you okay?"

She shook her head slightly. "Could you please take me home?"

Sebastian: "It's no trouble. My pleasure."

He opened the car door.

Sophia got in.

Ethan clenched his fists, forced to watch helplessly as Sebastian drove away with her.

But…

Did she think this was over?

The document wasn't signed.

They had plenty of time.

Inside the car—

Sophia watched the cityscape fly past the window, bustling and vibrant.

Sebastian noticed her low and agitated mood. He quietly turned on some music.

"…Feeling any better?"

Sophia: "Thank you."

"Want to hear a joke? A nurse sees a patient drinking in his room. She goes over and cautions: 'Be careful, liver!' The patient smiles back: 'Hello, sweetie!' Well? Funny?"

Sophia: "…That's cold."

"It's a dad joke. The coldness is what makes it funny."

"…" He really knew how to justify himself.

Sebastian's smile faded, his expression turning serious. "Tell me, what's wrong? What was so important you had to see him?"

Sophia raised an eyebrow. "Why do you ask?"

"You despise him. You wouldn't have dinner with him unless… you needed something. Can you tell me about it?"

Sophia thought for a moment, then began to speak slowly…

Sebastian: "So, you need his signed agreement to finalize the procedures?"

"Yes."

"Couldn't you just… get someone else to sign it?"

Sophia turned her head, staring directly at him.

"Ahem!" Sebastian coughed lightly. "Just joking."

"I thought funding and approval would be the hardest parts. I didn't expect the problem to be with me."

Sebastian: "He didn't sign?"

"No."

The man's eyes darkened. "What were his conditions?"

Sophia: "…"

"Did he ask you to come back to him? To start over?"

"…" Had he been hiding under the table eavesdropping?

"Tch! How shameless! Still dreaming of getting back together? He has no self-awareness at all."

Sophia: "…" A critique from a fellow man hit particularly hard.

"What are you muttering about in your head?"

Sophia started. "…Was I?"

"Definitely!" Sebastian said sternly, looking like he'd already guessed and she shouldn't pretend otherwise.

Sophia: "…"

"Fine! It definitely wasn't anything good! You weren't secretly cursing me, were you?"

"Ahem— Nothing like that…"

Sebastian: "Where did you say that plot of land was located?"

"East郊."

"Good location. Close to the city, convenient transportation. Did he give it to you when you broke up?"

Sophia's mouth twitched. "Why do you have so many questions?"

"This… is really tricky. The pen is in Ethan Roscente's hand. Neither you nor I can force him to sign. But this isn't the only way."

Sophia's eyes lit up. "You have another idea?"

"Yes."

The light in her eyes grew brighter.

Sebastian: "I also have land in the East郊. I'm willing to sign. You can use it to build your lab."

Sophia was stunned. He said it so casually, but this was land, not a toy!

"Forget it. I don't have the money to buy your land."

Sebastian: "No charge. A gift."

"Then I definitely can't accept it. No merits to deserve such a favor."

"Then just pay whatever amount you're willing to. A token gesture?"

Sophia: "…Mr. Evans, is your family's land not selling? Are you forcing it on people?"

Sebastian smiled. "To me, you're not just 'people.'"

Sophia: "…" There was no response to that.

Before getting out of the car, she reiterated her position. "I appreciate your willingness to help, but I will handle this matter myself."

Sebastian heard this. He was a little disappointed, but it was expected. "Alright."

If she could be easily swayed by such things, she wouldn't be Sophia Sullivan.

…

Back home, Sophia sat on the sofa, looking at the documents and pen she had brought back untouched, and couldn't help but sigh deeply.

Downstairs, Alexander Laurent was returning from the lab.

He happened to see Sebastian Evans's car at the alley entrance.

He hadn't paid it any mind initially, but Sebastian stopped and greeted him first. "Good afternoon, Professor Laurent."

Alexander turned his head, meeting Sebastian's faintly smiling eyes. He spoke calmly. "What brings you here, Mr. Evans?"

"Of course, to bring Sophia home."

Sophia?
###Chapter 274

A shadow flickered in Alexander Laurent's eyes.

Sebastian Evans' lips curved slightly. "I heard Professor Laurent is very busy, always in the lab. You're home quite early today."

"Heard?" Alexander's tone was flat. "From whom?"

He had taught a class today, covering a core course for the School of Life Sciences. Sophia Sullivan hadn't been in the lecture hall.

Hannah Morse said she had taken the day off.

The lab project was at a critical stage. He usually went straight there after class and rarely came home at this hour.

But today...

Sebastian chuckled lightly. "Sophia told me, of course."

Alexander's expression remained blank. "Did she also mention you can't park at the alley entrance?"

"Leaving now." Sebastian pressed the accelerator.

The car pulled away.

After a short distance, he suddenly froze.

Just now...

Did Alexander call her "Sophia"?

...

Watching the car disappear, Alexander turned and entered the building.

His jaw was tight, his gaze cool.

He reached the seventh floor but didn't go to his own apartment. Instead, he knocked on the door next door.

"Sophia, are you in?"

A few seconds later, the door opened.

"...Professor?"

Alexander looked her over. "Are you alright?"

"...Huh?" Sophia was confused.

"You weren't in class today. Your advisor said you took leave."

"Yes, I had some things to handle."

"Related to the lab rectification?"

"Right." Sophia nodded.

"Did it go smoothly?"

Sophia smiled. "Just one final step left."

"Do you need any help?"

"No."

Sebastian was right. Unless Ethan Roscente signed willingly, no one could force him.

Alexander's gaze shifted subtly. "I ran into Sebastian Evans downstairs just now."

"He gave me a ride home."

"You were together?"

"No," Sophia explained. "We happened to meet. He helped me with something."

Alexander's eyes deepened.

"As long as you're alright. Your father's braised beef was excellent. Please thank him for me."

Sophia laughed. "My dad will be thrilled to hear that."

"I'm just being honest. His cooking is truly exceptional."

...

Meanwhile, after leaving the restaurant, Ethan Roscente didn't return to the office.

He had Liam Evans arrange a golf game with Zachary Wang.

Liam was surprised.

Hadn't he canceled the dinner meeting? How did it end so quickly?

It seemed...

The talk with Miss Sullivan didn't go well.

Time to be extra careful again.

Liam sighed inwardly.

...

Blue skies, white clouds, a gentle breeze.

On the lush green golf course—

Ethan gazed into the distance and swung his club.

Thwack!

The white ball traced a perfect arc through the air.

Clap, clap, clap—

Zachary applauded. "Great shot!"

Ethan walked to the rest area, his face expressionless.

Zachary studied him. "Something on your mind, Mr. Roscente?"

Ethan took a sip of water and said nothing.

"Business troubles?"

Ethan didn't react.

Zachary understood. "Ah, a woman then."

Ethan raised an eyebrow. "You have experience?"

"Women," Zachary said, sitting beside him. "They can be decoration or a crutch. Understand their use, and life becomes comfortable."

"Oh? Do tell."

"You need one at home to manage the trivialities," Zachary explained. "For social events, bring a young one along. They can shield you from drinks and entertain guests. A little money is all it takes."

Ethan: "Your wife doesn't mind?"

Zachary: "Why would she? Big house, luxury brands, buys whatever she wants with a card, no need to work. 
###Chapter 275

What more could she want?"

Ethan: "What if she asked for a divorce—"

"Impossible. A woman gets used to being kept. Her wings atrophy. How could she fly?" He sneered.

"And if they haven't atrophied? If she really does fly away?"

Zachary was stunned.

This...

He'd never considered the possibility of his wife leaving.

Ethan stood up and clapped him on the shoulder. "Don't speak too absolutely, old friend."

Zachary: "?"

"It'll hurt when you're proven wrong."

With that, he walked to the golf cart. "Enjoy your game. I'm heading out."

"Hey?"

...

Leaving the course, Ethan initially meant to return to his Beverly Hills mansion.

But somehow, he found himself driving to the gates of MIT.

This time, he parked across the street.

He rolled down the window and lit a cigarette.

Through the haze of smoke, he looked at the school gates. They looked the same as they had six years ago.

He first saw Sophia Sullivan right here.

One glance was all it took.

He fell for her instantly.

He confessed his feelings here too.

Holding roses, he walked toward the girl he loved.

The moment he embraced her, he felt like he had the whole world.

When did it start to change?

After the company went public, he had more free time.

Drinks and card games lost their thrill. He began seeking greater excitement.

Looking back now, those other women seemed utterly bland.

If given another chance, he would just want to be with Sophia.

A clean, simple life.

But it was too late...

By the time he returned to the mansion, it was already dark.

Martha was still there. "You're back, young master."

Ethan grunted in acknowledgment and started upstairs, then paused.

"Martha." He turned.

Martha, who hadn't managed to slip away today: "!"

"...Yes, young master?"

Ethan: "Lend me your phone."

Martha carefully handed it over. "Young master, don't be angry. Anger hurts the body."

Mostly, her phone bore the brunt.

Ethan didn't respond, dialing Sophia's number.

"...Hello."

"I was too harsh at noon. Since I gave you the land, it's yours. I won't take it back."

Sophia frowned, unsure what he was playing at.

Ethan: "I'll sign. We can discuss the details tomorrow."

"...Okay."

"I'm calling from Martha's phone. It's inconvenient. Can you take me off your block list?"
###Chapter 276

Sophia Sullivan finally nodded.

She only cared about the part where he agreed to sign.

A faint smile touched Ethan Roscente's lips.
He handed the phone back to Martha.
Then he turned and went upstairs.

Martha held the phone and sighed softly.

The young master hadn't smiled like that in a long time.

...

Early morning, Sophia was woken by her phone vibrating.

Dawn hadn't fully broken.
Her phone on the pillow buzzed incessantly.

She squinted, unlocking the screen.
WeChat notifications popped up one after another.

All from Ethan Roscente.

Dozens of unread messages.
The content was meaningless.

Are you awake, Clara?
I dreamed about you.
Still sleeping?
Do you have class today?
Amelia says you have a major class this morning.

She scanned the screen expressionlessly.
She couldn't be bothered to scroll up.

Just as she was about to put the phone down, a new message arrived.

Clara, I bought soy milk and fried dough sticks.
I'm downstairs at your place.
No rush. I'll wait for you.

Sophia frowned.
She got up and walked to the balcony.

Ethan stood downstairs holding breakfast.

He seemed to sense her.
He suddenly looked up.

Their eyes met.
He opened his mouth to speak.

She slammed the window shut.

...

Sophia lay back in bed, eyes closed, feigning sleep.

She couldn't sleep, but lying down was still restful.

At exactly seven, she got up on time.

She washed up, changed clothes, and made a simple breakfast.

She finished eating before going downstairs.

Ethan's eyes lit up.
He quickly approached her.

"Clara, I got the soy milk and fried dough from your usual place."
"Too bad they're cold now. They need reheating."

Sophia's tone was flat. "I've already eaten. You deal with them."

Ethan wasn't annoyed. "Then I'll eat them."
"I'm not going to the company today. I'll take you to school."

"It's a three-minute walk from here to school. Do I need a ride?"

"Then I'll walk with you."

"Ethan, you—"

"Didn't you want to talk about signing? We can talk on the way."

Sophia was silent.

"Is that okay?" he pressed.

"Do whatever you want."

The man's lips curved into a slight smile.
###Chapter 277
He quickened his pace to catch up.

"Clara, wait for me."

She deliberately walked faster.

Ethan watched her retreating figure, a smile in his eyes.

At the school gate.

Sophia had had enough. "You followed. You escorted me. When will you sign?"

"You said yesterday the terms were negotiable. Does that still stand?"

"What are your conditions?"

"This Saturday and Sunday. Give me two full days."

"What do you mean?"

"Spend two days with me. You can't refuse any request."
"After it's over, I'll sign immediately."

Sophia laughed in anger. "I need your signature, but not enough to sell myself."

"Just two days," Ethan's gaze was intense. "Do you really hate me that much?"

"Some things are better left unsaid out of politeness. You insist on asking."
"Yes. You are that hateful."

She turned and walked through the school gates.

Ethan stood there with a bitter smile. "I didn't mean it like that..."
"In your eyes, am I really that despicable..."

Sophia went to class first.

After class, she met up with Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence.
They headed to the lab.

They only had five days of access left.
They had to complete the first phase of data before the deadline.

The lab door was wide open.

Several cleaners were moving things out.

Hannah rushed forward. "What are you doing!"
"Who said you could touch this! This is our stuff!"

This lab held too much of their effort.

Every item was carefully chosen.
Every corner was cleaned by their own hands.

Strangers suddenly barging in made Hannah instantly furious.

"Put it down! Put everything down!"

The cleaners looked at each other. "The college notified us to come move it."

Sophia stayed calm. "Who notified you?"

"Professor Victoria Lowell. She said it failed the fire inspection."
"Told us to move everything out for renovations."

"That old witch again!" Hannah gritted her teeth.
"We still have five days! She can't even wait that long?"

"Is she even fit to be a teacher?"

The cleaners shook their heads helplessly. "We're just following orders."

Sophia didn't give them a hard time. "It's noon. Go to lunch first. We'll deal with this afternoon."

"Alright. We'll head out then."

Hannah's eyes reddened. "Sophia, we still have over a dozen data sets to run."
"What do we do if we can't use the lab?"

They had decided to build their own lab, but that took time.

At this stage, they needed to complete the experiment for data analysis.

Getting kicked out now threw all their plans into chaos.

"This is too much. Does she own the college?"

Shane Holloway sauntered over, hands in pockets. "What pig is squealing?"

Hannah's eyes widened. "You're the pig!"

"Touchy about being called fat."

"Heh— You still have time to argue about that?"
"If I were you, I'd just leave on my own. Save yourself the embarrassment of being thrown out."

Shane wore a look of smug triumph.

Sophia pulled Hannah back. "Let's just pack our things."

"Sophia!"

Shane laughed triumphantly. "Should have been this sensible from the start."
"Did you really need me to come kick you out? How pathetic."

Sophia picked up an instrument.
As she passed him, her hand suddenly slipped.

Bang!

A sharp cry of pain erupted.

Holy crap.

Shane Holloway clutched his foot, hopping in place.

He was grimacing in pain.

Sophia Sullivan looked utterly innocent. "My hand slipped. Your face is so thick, you should be fine, right?"

Hannah Morse didn't say a word. She just hoisted an entire lab table.

Shane's eyes widened. "What are you doing?"

Hannah grinned. "Moving stuff—"

The table flew toward him.

Shane scrambled away, rolling and crawling.

The table crashed to the floor with a deafening bang.

"Are you insane?!"

Marcus Lawrence strode past.

He stepped squarely on Shane's other foot.

"Ah— Sorry. Not wearing my glasses. Stepped on some trash."

Hannah corrected him seriously. "Trash can be recycled. That thing is worse than trash."

Shane was trembling with rage.

"This has to be moved today! Otherwise, I'm calling the janitors to do it for you!"

He spat the threat and fled in disgrace.

Hannah planted her hands on her hips and laughed. "Don't run! I'm not done moving things yet!"

Her laughter died, and her face fell.

"Only five days left."

Marcus looked grim. "This is beyond insulting."

Sophia walked to a corner and pulled out her phone.

"Professor Laurent, can you do me a favor?"

...

After noon, the janitor returned.

This time, he wasn't there to move things.

"Students, the school says the move is postponed for now. It'll happen in five days."

Sophia knew Alexander Laurent had intervened.

"Thank you for your trouble."

"No trouble at all. It's my job..."

The equipment was returned, and the lab was restored to its original state.

Hannah and Marcus immediately changed into their lab coats.

Sophia joined them.

The three worked until ten at night.

Lunch and dinner were takeout.

Sophia checked her watch. "It's ten. Let's call it a day."

Hannah said, "We continue tomorrow."

Marcus nodded.

They took a taxi home.

Sophia was the first to get out.

The hallway was dark and cold.

She pulled her coat tighter.

"Sophia."

Alexander Laurent was in workout clothes, sweat on his brow.

"Professor, you're running this late?"

"No time during the day. Making up for it now."

Sophia waited for him to approach.

They walked upstairs together.

"Thank you for today."

"Don't mention it. Is five days enough? I can try to get more time if not."

"It's enough."

The fire safety issue couldn't be overlooked.

They would have to move eventually.

She didn't want to trouble him further.

They reached the seventh floor.

"Goodnight, Professor."

"Goodnight."

Sophia closed her door.

Alexander returned to his own apartment.

His study computer was on.

Messages from Quincy Evans were popping up frantically.

[Running again?]

[Five times in one night? Are you possessed?]

[Is there gold on the road?]

[Forget it. I'll analyze the data myself.]

Quincy went offline.

Alexander thought of the scene in the hallway.

The girl standing alone.

The light made her look slight and solitary.

Fortunately, he had run into her on his fifth trip downstairs.

Getting to walk a flight of stairs with her.

Not bad.

The corner of his mouth lifted.

...

Sophia arrived home.

Warm air greeted her.

She drank a glass of warm water.

It was almost eleven by the time she finished showering.

She sat down, rubbing her temples.

Her phone rang.

Seeing the caller ID, her expression darkened.

"...Hello."

"Sophia, just one day."

"?"

Ethan Roscente's voice was soft. "Just one day. I won't make any unreasonable demands. Everything will be outdoors. I'll bring you home before dark."

Sophia was wary. "What do you want?"

He gave a bitter laugh. "Seeing you is so difficult now. I just want to talk quietly."

It had become a luxury.

Something that required an exchange to achieve.

He pressed his lips together in self-mockery.

Sophia said, "...Alright."

The man's eyes lit up.

"But on one condition," she added.

"What condition?"

Sophia said, "Any request, if I don't like it or feel uncomfortable, I refuse directly."

"Okay."
###Chapter 278

Saturday.

The rain that had lasted for two days finally stopped.

Each winter rain brings a deeper chill.

The temperature in the city plummeted.

The sweltering summer was long gone.

Only a piercing cold remained.

And a biting wind.

Sophia Sullivan wore a padded coat when she went out.

She put on a hat and scarf.

Wrapping herself up tightly.

Ethan Roscente was already waiting downstairs.

On such a cold day.

He had parked his car on the roadside opposite the alley entrance.

But he himself had come to wait at the entrance of her building.

Passersby couldn't help but glance at him twice.

Yet he remained indifferent.

His eyes were fixed solely on the building's exit.

His focus was almost reverent.

Alexander Laurent was heading out to the lab.

He saw Ethan Roscente as soon as he stepped out of the building.

Naturally.

Ethan Roscente saw him too.

Their eyes met.

Hostility simmered in both men's gazes.

Alexander Laurent had a very poor impression of Ethan.

Even Sebastian Evans left a better impression than Ethan did.

Remembering that time he went to the villa to move books.

What Ethan had done to Sophia…

Alexander's expression darkened instantly.

"Mr. Roscente, did you just arrive this morning, or did you not leave last night?"

Ethan sneered.

"Professors read too many books. They tend to overcomplicate things. Whether I just arrived or never left isn't important. What matters is—"

He curled his lips.

Emphasizing each word.

"Clara agreed to go on a date with me. We're going out together today."

Alexander's first reaction was disbelief.

But then he remembered Sophia had been busy with lab matters recently.

Could there be some connection between the two?

He suppressed his thoughts.

His expression unchanged.

"If Sophia agreed to meet with you, she must have her own reasons."

"Date" was directly changed to "meet with you".

Who said professors couldn't be sharp with their words?

"I just want to remind you. As a man, you can be poor. You can be ugly. But you cannot lack character."

Ethan's brow furrowed.

"What do you mean?"

"Respecting women, not doing anything against their will—that is a man's basic integrity and cultivation. You'd do well to remember that."

Having said that.

He walked past Ethan.

Heading towards the alley.

His steps were steady.

His shadow was calm.

Only in places unseen.

His fists had slowly clenched.

The veins on the back of his hands bulged.

…

The moment Sophia came downstairs and saw the man.

She couldn't help but pause.

Ethan wasn't wearing a suit today.

Dark blue jeans.

Paired with a gray and white striped down jacket.

His soft black hair fell naturally across his brow.

It lessened his sharpness and frivolity.

Adding a touch of youthfulness and sunshine.

For a moment.

She seemed to see the Ethan of the past.

Back then.

The man was still a spirited youth.

His eyes were pure.

And intense.

The way he looked at her was so focused.

It once made Sophia believe this relationship had no expiration date.

And would never change.

Yet reality told her—

Nothing lasts forever.

Feelings change.

And people change too.

"What's the plan now?" She got straight to the point.

No expectation.

No joy.

A business-like tone.

As if completing a task.

A trace of sadness flashed in Ethan's eyes.

But he quickly smiled again.

"Get in the car first."

They walked across the street.

Ethan personally opened the passenger door for her.

"Watch your head."

Sophia bent down and got in.

He walked around to the driver's side.

Sat down.

Started the engine.

"Do you remember our first date?"

Sophia remained silent.

A hint of nostalgia appeared in the man's eyes.

He continued on his own.

"It was at that coffee shop on the corner up ahead. I bought flowers and a cake. We agreed to meet at 2 PM. But by 3 PM, you still hadn't shown up. You weren't answering your phone either…"

By 4 PM.

Sophia finally arrived.

She was still wearing a white lab coat.

Apologizing profusely.

"I'm so sorry, so sorry. I was in the lab today. I couldn't bring my phone. And then I forgot about our date this afternoon…"

Back then.

They had just started dating.

Clearly, she wasn't used to having a boyfriend yet.

Ethan had been full of pent-up anger.

The young master had never waited for anyone like this before.

Usually, it was others waiting for him.

But upon seeing the girl's apologetic face.

Hearing her endless apologies.

That anger somehow just… vanished?

With a sizzle—

It extinguished completely.

"You were too busy. After that, whenever we went out, I almost always arrived first. I'd order the food and wait for you. The longest wait… was probably when Professor Watson took you to an academic symposium. The organizers changed the schedule last minute, delaying the end by two hours. By the time you rushed over, the restaurant was almost closed."

Sophia's face remained expressionless.

But her gaze flickered slightly.

That was their first argument.

It ended with Ethan being the first to back down and apologize.

"And another time, you went to the northwest with Professor Watson to collect specimens. You left just like that, without even telling me. I foolishly went to wait at the school gate. I waited all morning, but never saw you…"

Ethan said a lot.

But Sophia remained silent throughout.

"Clara, do you still remember any of this?"

"Things from the past. I can't remember clearly anymore."

Ethan wasn't discouraged by her cold attitude.

Instead, he smiled.

"It's okay. You'll remember."

How could anyone easily forget things they experienced personally?

She was just pretending to forget.

Unwilling to admit it.

Thirty minutes later.

The car stopped at a wine Manor in the suburbs.

Ethan reached out.

"Let's get out, Clara."

Sophia ignored him.

She got out and stood on her own.

The man wasn't angry.

He smiled as he looked at the Manor before them.

"Do you remember this place?"

Sophia wished she didn't.

But her memory was too good.

This Manor was actually a wine cellar.

Julian Winston lost it to Ethan in a card game.

Ethan loved like the hustle and bustle of the city.

He had little interest in vacations.

If he had free time.

He'd rather organize a drinking or card game with Charlie and the others.

Than come to such a remote place.

But Sophia fell in love with this place at first sight.

Far from the hustle and bustle of the city.

Even the wind carried a sense of freedom.

Open the door, and mountains greet you.

Before the mountains, a stream.

The water is clear.

Fish swim within.

It had a feeling of "secluded living".

The only pity was within the Manor.

Since the owner was absent.

It lacked long-term care.

Large flower beds were abandoned.

During the summer break of her senior year.

Ethan went on a business trip to France.

He wouldn't be back for a month.

She took the keys.

And simply came to stay here alone.

She stayed.

For over half a month.

During that time, while digging for wild vegetables.

Her phone accidentally fell into the stream.

It was completely destroyed.

Sophia didn't want to make a special trip to the city to buy a new phone.

So she ordered one online.

The delivery was supposed to arrive the next day.

But due to stormy weather.

The mountain road collapsed.

The快递 was delayed.

She had to wait two extra days to get the phone.

It was during these four days without a phone.

Ethan couldn't reach her.

He almost went crazy.

In his own words—

He almost turned the entire city upside down.

When she finally got the phone.

Inserted the SIM card.

Her first action was to call him back.

And send messages.

Trying to explain and reassure.

But Ethan seemed to take revenge on her.

He wouldn't answer calls.

He wouldn't reply to messages.

Sophia found it utterly baffling.

It wasn't intentional.

She had explained clearly.

Moreover, a few days earlier during a call.

He said he would stay in France for an extra half month.

Sophia naturally had no objection.

She was enjoying her stay at the Manor.

Carefree and content alone.

She never expected…
Ethan Roscente appeared abruptly at the estate's entrance.

Sophia Sullivan hadn't even had time to smile.

He coldly waved his hand.

A group of bodyguards in black swiftly rushed into the garden.

They roughly uprooted the flower seedlings she had carefully nurtured.

Dirt flew through the air.

Tender green stems and leaves were trampled mercilessly.

"Am I short of money to buy you flowers? Do you need to plant this trash with your own hands?"

"You don't answer my calls or texts. So this is where you've been, playing in the dirt!"

"Clear it all out. Not a single plant remains."

In just twenty minutes, the garden was a complete mess.

Two weeks of her hard work vanished.

Sophia stood frozen, a chill running through her.

She watched Ethan direct the destruction.

She watched the tender seedlings being ripped out by their roots.

She watched the soil being churned into chaos.

This was no accident.

It was deliberate annihilation.

A fierce argument erupted between them.

Ethan grabbed her wrist. "Are these flowers more important than answering my call?"

"I used all my connections to find you. I almost called the police. And you were here, enjoying yourself?"

"Sophia, I always come after your studies. Now I'm less important than a few flowers?"

…

"Why can't you care about me a little more?"

…

"Last time you said you'd delay coming home. I waited for you until dawn. You didn't even offer a word of comfort."

…

"Stop your studies. We'll get married after you graduate."

Sophia's initial fury was disarmed by the vulnerability in his eyes.

She began to doubt herself. Had she been too cold?

Had she truly neglected his feelings?

This prolonged self-reflection led to a wrong decision—

She gave up her direct Ph.D. opportunity.

This estate became the watershed moment of her life.

Back to the present.

Ethan pushed open the greenhouse door.

A stunning sea of flowers appeared before them.

Even in the depths of winter, a riot of colors was in full bloom.

Roses, orchids, azaleas all vied for attention.

It was warm as spring inside the greenhouse.

A precise climate control system maintained the perfect environment.

Flowers from different seasons bloomed simultaneously here.

Ethan pointed to a cluster of phalaenopsis orchids. "This type has very specific soil requirements. I used a mix of sphagnum moss and bark."

"The temperature must be kept above 15 degrees. Watering needs to be adjusted seasonally…"

His explanation was meticulous.

But Sophia's gaze drifted past the flowers, toward the distant mountains.

Vibrant roses bloomed fiercely by the window.

In the past, this would have moved her deeply.

Now, her heart was as still as placid water.

Not even his voice could stir a single ripple.

"Flowers bloom and fall in their own time. So do feelings. Once missed, they're gone."

Ethan stared at her intently. "What if I refuse to let go?"

Sophia met his gaze calmly. "That has nothing to do with me."
###Chapter 279

Her tone was calm.

It was as if all the past had vanished into thin air.

Ethan's chest felt tight.

The harder he tried to hold on, the faster he lost.

He had once destroyed the garden she loved.

Now he had returned it to her in full bloom.

But she no longer lingered.

"If you don't like it, we can change locations."

"No, I like it very much." Sophia looked directly at him. "These flowers are beautiful. Anyone would be moved by them."

"But if this is just your tactic to win me back."

"Then it's a disservice to their beauty."

"And I won't accept that."

Ethan was stunned. "I just wanted to apologize."

"Let the past stay in the past." Sophia said softly. "You put so much effort into this. You should have planted it for yourself, not for me."

"Your life should be filled with happiness."

"Not messing yourself up over a relationship that shouldn't continue."

"Ethan, we are independent individuals."

"Each with our own path in life."

"We walked together for a while. Now we've parted. If we meet again, it should be with mutual well-wishes."

"Perhaps you'll meet someone better in the future."

"Isn't it better to let go of the past and face the future openly?"

Hearing that "Ethan" again after a year.

His eyes stung.

His heart ached with a bitter pain.

"No..."

He wouldn't let go of the past.

He would never meet anyone better than her.

"Is there really no chance for us?"

Sophia gently shook her head.

Lunch was meticulously prepared.

All her favorite dishes.

It was almost laughable.

When they were together, he never remembered.

Now that they were apart, he remembered every single one.

"Try this. You used to love it."

Ethan kept serving her food.

He barely touched his own plate.

"Thank you. That's enough."

"Okay." He forced a smile.

Sophia enjoyed the meal thoroughly.

The food tasted excellent.

The ambiance was comfortable.

The long window faced the flower field.

The rice was her favorite Wuchang rice.

It was a feast for both her taste buds and her eyes.

"...I'm full."

She put down her chopsticks.

Ethan's gaze was tender. "Would you like to rest? The rooms are all ready."

Sophia raised an eyebrow. "Really?"

"Of course!"

This didn't sound like something he would say.

"Reminding you, there are six hours until sunset."

"I know." He said softly. "You get sleepy in the afternoon if you don't nap in winter."

Sophia was silent for a moment. "I want a separate room."

The man smiled bitterly. "It was prepared for you."

"I wouldn't be that shameless."

Bitterness filled his eyes. "Last time at the villa... I was too impulsive."

"You were gone for days without a word."

"I missed you too much."

"And I wanted to scare you into coming back."

Sophia's expression was complex.

There was confusion, and also pity.

Pity for this man who didn't know how to love.

He still had many detours ahead.

And she was just the starting point.

Fortunately, just the starting point.

The housekeeper led her to the second floor.

It was the same room as before.

Even the vase she had picked out was still on the windowsill.

"Please rest, Miss Sullivan."

The housekeeper gently closed the door.

Sophia napped for forty minutes.

When she came downstairs, she saw Ethan sitting on the sofa.

The tea in front of him was untouched.

He was lost in thought.

He only snapped back to reality when he heard her footsteps.

"Sophia? Is the room not suitable? I'll have someone—"

"No need." Sophia interrupted him. "I'm rested. Where to next?"

Ethan was stunned.

He had thought she would sleep until evening.

Sophia met his surprised gaze. "I keep my word."

The man smiled.

"Then... shall we go?"

Sophia nodded gently.

He took her to the mall they used to frequent.

The bar they often visited.

The club they enjoyed.

And her favorite sunset viewing platform.

The platform was on a mountain north of the city.

It required a twenty-kilometer drive on winding mountain roads.

The road was narrow with sharp turns.

Sophia used to come here when she was upset.

Standing high up and looking over the entire city.

It always made her troubles seem small.

Not worth worrying about.

After the breakup, Ethan came here often too.

He used to come to pick up a sulking her and take her home.

She would always feel better after spending a few hours here.

He never imagined that one day he would become a regular here himself.
###Chapter 280

They stood on the viewing platform.

The sunset painted the sky.

The sun slowly sank.

From a full circle to a half.

Then it vanished completely.

Only the evening glow remained.

Sophia spoke softly. "We should go back."

Ethan nodded. "I'll drive you."

A gentle breeze blew.

Their eyes met.

Both were calm and composed.

Inside the car—

Sophia finished a call.

She turned to Ethan. "Take me back to MIT. My professor needs me."

"Okay."

The sky darkened.

The car stopped at the MIT entrance.

Ethan got out.

He walked around and opened the passenger door.

Sophia stepped out and stood straight.

She looked up at him. "I kept my promise. I hope you keep yours."

Ethan gazed at her serene face.

He wanted to hold her hand.

Sophia stepped back, avoiding his touch.

"Clara, I know I was wrong. I truly want to start over. Give me another chance?"

Sophia watched his pleading expression.

She gave a faint smile.

"I initially refused your request. But I thought about it. Some things need clarity. So I agreed."

"You should understand my intention. This day wasn't for rekindling old flames. It was for you to see—"

Ethan's heart tightened.

He had a bad feeling.

Sophia continued. "Broken mirrors can't be fixed. Flawed things can't return to the past."

"Stop wasting your time on me. It's not worth it. You're a businessman. You understand investment. Cut your losses on a doomed project."

"It might hurt. But cutting out the rot is the only way to heal. You need courage and time."

"You'll be fine. Goodbye."

Sophia waved and turned.

She strode into the campus.

Ethan stood frozen.

He watched her walk away.

Until she disappeared from sight.

He always believed.

If he turned back.

She would always be there waiting.

But this time.

She left first.

Without looking back.

Ethan knew.

He had lost her completely.

His eyes reddened.

A dull ache spread through his chest.

The pain was excruciating.

He stepped back.

And collapsed onto a bench by the road.

Time passed.

A gentle female voice spoke.

"Hey, are you okay?"

Ethan slowly looked up.

He met a pair of beautiful eyes.

Full of curiosity and concern.

He recognized her.

The woman he'd met at the gate twice before.

Once, she picked up the flowers he discarded.

Another time, she took the cake he was about to throw away.

Ethan glanced at her.

He didn't respond.

Fiona noticed the Ferrari nearby.

He had changed cars again.

She carefully sat beside him. "Are... you hurting?"

Still no response.

Fiona wasn't discouraged.

At least he didn't push her away.

She asked, "Do you need a tissue?"

The man remained silent.

Fiona stopped talking.

She tightened her down jacket.

She sat with him on the bench.

In the cold wind.

Watching night fall.

Until it was completely dark.

The streetlights flickered on.

Neon lights glowed in the distance.

The man slowly stood up.

Fiona was startled. "Hey—"

Ethan ignored her.

He got into his car and drove away.

In that moment.

Fiona felt a pang of envy for Sophia.

How did she make such a proud man act like a devoted puppy?

How did she resist the temptation of luxury cars and watches?

She had seen Ethan bring Sophia back.

She saw it clearly.

The distance was too far to hear their words.

But from the man's dejected look.

Sophia had rejected him.

And not gently.

Fiona shoved her hands into her pockets.

Her palms warmed slowly.

But after sitting in the cold for so long.

Her feet were frozen.

Still, she thought it was worth it.

When he looked up.

He at least recognized her.

A smile touched her lips.

She watched the direction his car left.

Her envy turned into determination.

The first time she saw Ethan.

It was just curiosity.

Later, their chance meetings.

Made her realize he was from a world beyond her reach.

This kind of opportunity wouldn't come again.

Why hesitate?

Only...

He was harder to handle than she imagined.

Fiona frowned slightly.

But soon, her eyes sparkled with excitement.

High difficulty meant high reward.

It was worth the gamble.

…

Ethan returned to his Beverly Hills mansion in a daze.

Martha had already cleaned and left.

The vast space held only him.

Charlie knew about his plan.

He guessed it was time for the result.

He called to ask. "How did it go? Was Sophia touched? Did she agree to get back together?"

Ethan's heart twisted.

He didn't answer.

He only said. "Come out. Drink with me."

Charlie's heart sank.

He guessed the outcome.

When he arrived at the bar.

Ethan was on a couch, drinking alone.

Whether from the lights or the alcohol.

The corners of his eyes were red.

Two empty bottles sat on the table.

He kept drinking, one gulp after another.

Charlie quickly sat down. "Ethan, stop drinking…"

"I know you're hurting. But there are so many women out there! Maybe… let it go? You can have any woman you want."

Ethan didn't speak.

The music thumped around them.

Laughter drifted through the door crack.

His consciousness began to blur.

He suddenly spoke. "Remember this bar?"

Charlie was stunned.

He looked around.

Then he remembered something.

He gasped.

This bar.

Was the very place.

Where Ethan held Isabella and broke up with Sophia during his birthday celebration!

And it was even the same private room!
###Chapter 281

Better Not

The familiar surroundings seemed to mock him.

Why had he said those things?

Looking back, it felt like his mind had been hijacked.

He had only cared about his own gratification.

Completely ignoring her despair at that moment.

In just one short year.

Sophia Sullivan had already returned to school.

Yet he remained trapped in this place.

Unable to move on.

Unwilling to move on.

Ethan Roscente's knuckles turned white as he gripped his glass.

He suddenly let out a low, bitter laugh.

The cleaner the breakup had been.

The deeper his regret now.

Charlie Lowell could only sigh watching him.

Unable to persuade him, he simply joined in.

"Ethan, I'll drink with you."

Soon, Ethan was dead drunk.

Charlie drove him back to the Beverly Hills mansion.

The man kept muttering incoherently with his eyes closed.

"Sophia... don't go..."

Charlie's heart ached for him.

He had witnessed this relationship from start to finish.

He never expected it to end like this.

After helping him into the bedroom.

Charlie hesitated for a moment before making a call.

"Martha, could you come to the mansion?"

Martha had just fallen asleep when she was awakened.

She arrived half an hour later, dark circles under her eyes.

Charlie was smoking, waiting for her.

"You're finally here!"

Martha glanced at the bed.

"Drunk again?"

Is this never going to end?

Charlie cleared his throat softly.

"He was in a bad mood and drank too much. Please take care of him."

He tried to make a quick exit.

Martha stopped him.

"Wait."

"?"

"There's a trash can in the room."

"I know?"

"Don't just drop your cigarette butts anywhere! You're not the one mopping the floor, are you?"

Charlie nodded awkwardly.

"I'll be more careful next time..."

Martha tucked Ethan in.

Muttering to herself, she went to the kitchen to make sobering soup.

When she returned, she found he had rolled onto the floor.

Her face fell.

Resigned, she dragged him back onto the bed.

Holding the sobering soup, she tried to feed him.

Ethan's teeth were clenched shut.

Martha tried several times without success.

The soup was getting cold.

Gritting her teeth, she pinched his cheeks.

Ethan's lips instantly puckered.

She finally managed to get some soup into him.

Martha felt his forehead; it was a little warm.

She quickly fetched a damp towel to place on it.

Ethan felt a cool sensation in his haze.

He tried hard to open his eyes but couldn't.

He remembered how Sophia always stayed by his side whenever he got drunk.

Longing instantly flooded his heart.

He suddenly grabbed that hand.

"Sophia, don't go... I love you..."

Martha was startled.

She tried hard to pull her hand back but couldn't break free.

This is unbearable!

Doing three jobs for one salary?

"Young Master, wake up! It's me, Martha!"

"Sophia... don't compare yourself to Martha... I forbid you... to belittle yourself..."

Martha: "??!!"

Why can't I be compared?

How is that belittling?!

"Sophia..."

"Sophia my foot!" Martha slapped him.

She startled herself after doing it.

But she couldn't help the corners of her mouth twitching upward.

Unexpectedly, the slap actually worked.

Ethan immediately let go.

Martha hurried back to her room.

Lying in bed, she tossed and turned.

Angry and worried.

She wouldn't be going back tonight.

Is Miss Sophia really not coming back?

Who can handle this madman in the future?

So worrying.

She finally managed to fall asleep.

She woke up with a start in the middle of the night.

Martha struggled to get up.

She quietly pushed open the master bedroom door.

A sour stench hit her.

It nearly made her vomit.

There was vomit all over the floor.

The culprit, however, was sleeping soundly.

Martha really wished heaven would just take her.

…

The next day, Ethan woke up early.

He shaved and put on his suit.

Looking clean and sharp.

A completely different person from last night.

Martha had already prepared the oatmeal porridge.

Not because she was diligent.

But because he always wanted it after getting drunk.

This time, she learned her lesson and prepared it in advance.

Just as she was about to take it to the bedroom.

She saw Ethan coming downstairs.

"Young Master, have some porridge to warm your stomach?"

Ethan stared at the porridge, momentarily dazed.

He shook his head gently.

"I'm not hungry. You don't need to make it specially anymore."

With that, he went straight out the door.

Martha: "?" Her first attempt at anticipating his needs was met with a brutal rejection.

…

In the coffee shop.

Sophia waited for less than five minutes.

She looked up and saw the man get out of his car and walk over.

A deep blue suit under a long overcoat.

The sharp cut accentuated his tall, straight figure.

He came in and sat down opposite her.

There seemed to be something more, and something less, in his eyes.

Sophia felt he seemed different.

She had been very surprised to receive Ethan's call this morning.

"Bring the documents over. I'll sign them."

Her heart, which had been hanged all night, finally settled.

She breathed a sigh of relief.

She had thought he might set conditions or deliberately make things difficult.

Unexpectedly, he took the documents, looked through them, and signed.

"Building a lab isn't easy. I wish you success. Remember to send me an invitation when it's completed."

Sophia: "Thank you."

Ethan smiled bitterly.

"It was my fault before. I lost you. Now I want to make amends, but it's too late. I know you want to draw a clear line, but I still have to ask: can we be friends?"

Sophia lowered her gaze, silent.

After a long while, she spoke softly.

"Better not."
###Chapter 282

Be my girlfriend.

Keep your distance.
Do not get close.
This is better for both of them.

Sophia Sullivan put away the documents.
She turned to leave.
The man's low voice reached her.

"I still consider you a friend."

Sophia did not look back.
She walked away directly.

Ethan Roscente watched her retreating figure.
He picked up his coffee.
Took a small sip.
Bitterness spread across his tongue.
His expression remained unchanged.

His thumb stroked the rim of the cup.
His gaze fell on the coffee cup opposite him.
She always added milk.
Because she feared bitterness.

Ethan reached over and took her cup.
Took a small taste.
It was indeed very sweet.

They had been together for six years.
Not six days.
Not six months.
A full six years.

How could he not understand her?
He knew her better than anyone.

So...
Ethan narrowed his eyes as he looked out the window.
He would never give up.
Sophia Sullivan had to be his.

She was his in the past.
She was not now.
But she would be in the future.

He finished the remaining coffee.
He used to only drink unsweetened Americanos.
Since she didn't like it.
He would change.

It wasn't difficult.
Just look at Sebastian Evans.

Why wasn't Sebastian rejected?
Because he knew how to hide.
How to pretend.

Using subtle methods.
Slowly infiltrating her life.
Like spring rain.
Fine and continuous.
Nourishing the soil.
Letting love grow wildly.

He retreated to advance.
Sophia felt no pressure.
Naturally, she let her guard down.
Allowing him to get close.

Sebastian could do it.
Why couldn't he?

Last night's alcohol made him drunk.
But clarity came in an instant.

In that moment, Ethan understood.
Winning Sophia back couldn't be rushed.
The more he pressured her.
The more she would hide.

His past actions had made her defensive.
To get close now.
He first had to make her believe he had truly moved on.

Only then would he have a chance.

Judging from Sophia's reaction just now.
The effect should be good.
At least she was no longer impatient.

...

Fiona Valentine passed the coffee shop with a classmate.
She had a full schedule of classes today.
She wanted to buy a coffee to perk up.

"Do you want one?" she asked her companion.
Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed the man by the window.
Her gaze flickered.

Her companion nodded. "I could use one."

"Wait a second—" Fiona stopped her.

"What's wrong?"

"Xin Xin, did you forget your package?"

"Oh! I almost did!"

Fiona smiled. "I'll get your drink. You go get your package?"

"Okay, thanks. A coconut latte, iced, no sugar."

"Got it. Hurry along."

Confirming her companion had left.
Fiona pushed open the coffee shop door.

She pretended to just notice Ethan.
Feigning surprise. "Hello~ Fancy meeting you again."

She walked to his table.
"Is this seat taken? May I sit?"

The man said nothing.
His face was expressionless.

Fiona wasn't angry.
She smiled brightly. "Since you're not saying anything, I'll take that as a yes."

She sat down gracefully.

Ethan had no desire to engage.
They'd met a few times.
But they weren't close.

Fiona asked naturally, "Are you okay? Sitting outside the school gates for so long yesterday, you didn't catch a cold, did you?"

Ethan remained silent.

Fiona continued.
"You come here for coffee too? This place is good. Better than nearby spots. I've tried many flavors. What you have is the signature iced Americano, right? Aromatic but a bit bitter. It's better with a pastry."

Ethan looked at her.
His eyes held a mocking glint.
A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched his lips.

Fiona felt a chill.
She struggled to maintain her smile.

"W-What are you looking at? Is there something on my face?" She touched her cheek.

Suddenly, Ethan spoke—

"Do you like me?"

He had seen too many women.
He was familiar with this look.

Even though she tried hard to conceal it.
It couldn't escape his eyes.

Fiona hadn't expected him to be so direct.
Her mind went blank.
Her face flushed.
Her voice softened. "I... Is it that obvious? You could tell?"

She admitted it outright.

He had met many women like her.
Beautiful ones.
Charming ones.
Every type imaginable.

Ethan felt bored.

He rubbed the rim of his cup.
His voice was cold and calm. "Then you should know, I have someone I like."

Fiona wasn't surprised.
She nodded. "I know. I've known for a long time. Sophia Sullivan is my classmate. We're in the same graduate year."

Ethan's hand paused.
He laughed softly. "Classmates?"

Fiona watched his thin lips curve.
That faint, mocking look in his eyes.
Rogue and unrestrained.

It made her heart flutter.

His voice sounded again. "Would you be willing to do me a favor?"

Fiona was stunned. "What favor?"

Ethan said, word by word, "Be my girlfriend."

He knew Sophia was highly guarded.
She held deep reservations about him.

Only by letting her know he had completely moved on.
And fallen for someone else.
Would she possibly let her guard down.
And allow him back into her life.

Even if just as a friend.

It just so happened Fiona was her classmate.
He could use Fiona.
To reasonably appear by her side.

Fiona's heart raced.

The man's words were like a demon's whisper.
Tugging at the desires in her heart.

She felt a sliver of hope and joy.
But looking up and seeing the indifference and calm in Ethan's eyes.
It instantly died down.

Smart as she was.
She immediately guessed his intention.

She was merely a tool for him to pursue Sophia.
A stepping stone.

Fiona fell silent.

Ethan stirred his coffee.
He spoke lightly. "You play along with me. In return, I'll help you financially."

"Of course, if you're unwilling, forget I said it."
###Chapter 283

Sophia Sullivan knew that once she nodded, all that would remain between them was a transaction.

This was completely different from what she truly wanted.

But if she refused…

The man would undoubtedly turn and leave without a second thought.

This might be her only chance!

"...Alright, I agree." She forced a casual smile, "It's just acting anyway. I suppose I'm getting the better end of the deal."

What was fake now didn't have to stay fake forever.

If only she had time…

Ethan Roscente's gaze was downcast, his expression detached. "My assistant will bring the contract later. Just sign it."

Black and white terms would prevent future entanglements. It was a lesson he'd learned from Isabella Langley.

Fiona Valentine smiled in agreement. "No problem."

Her heart, however, sank like a stone.

He really wanted no connection with her. His defenses were so high.

"Can we exchange WeChat now? For easier communication." Fiona confidently displayed her QR code.

Ethan gave it a cursory glance and sent a friend request.

Fiona accepted immediately. His profile picture was an ink wash painting: a misty river under a drizzling sky, a lone boat adrift in the fog.

"What a coincidence. Your picture is water, and mine is clouds."

Ethan replied flatly, "What does water have to do with clouds?"

Fiona was taken aback. "...They're both natural elements?"

Ethan corrected her. "It's not water."

"Huh?"

"It's rain."

Fiona offered an awkward smile. "I see… I didn't look closely enough just now…"

Ethan's fingertip lightly traced the image on his screen. "'On blue water better than sky, In painted boat listening to rain I lie.'"

Fiona fell silent. Her smile vanished completely.

"By the way, I still don't know your name… Let me send you mine first." Fiona clicked send.

But the man was already putting his phone away. "Ethan Roscente," he stated simply.

Fiona wanted to say more, but he was already rising to leave.

At the door, he suddenly turned back—

"For this cooperation to proceed smoothly, one thing must be absolutely clear."

"...What is it?" The woman looked up at him.

Ethan's face was expressionless. "During the contract period, this is strictly a professional relationship. No emotions involved. I have someone I love. I have no interest in you. You're a smart woman. So—"

"Don't develop feelings for me. It will lead nowhere. Except for Sophia Sullivan, I will never love anyone else."

His voice was calm, yet it carried the chill of icy rain.

...

On Sunday, Sophia Sullivan obtained the consent form signed by Ethan Roscente.

She couldn't process the formalities immediately, so she headed home first.

Just as she reached the alley entrance—

"Professor? Out for a run again?"

Alexander Laurent had been running the previous night too.

Ethan had been seeing her home then, and they encountered Alexander at the alley mouth, dressed in workout clothes, drenched in sweat.

His first words were—

"Are you alright?"

Sophia was puzzled. "Why do you ask?"

Did she seem like something was wrong?

Alexander simply smiled, gave her a once-over, and didn't answer.

"Care to join me for a couple laps?" he invited.

Sophia pointed upstairs. "Let me change first. See you in a bit."

"Alright."

She hadn't expected him to run again this morning after last night.

Sophia blinked. "Professor, are you training for a race?"

"No." Alexander shook his head.

"Then this level of exercise…" Isn't it a bit much? Anyone would think he was training for a marathon…

Alexander chuckled softly.

A closer look revealed a hint of guilt behind his smile.

Sophia asked further, "Is the lab not busy?"

"Not really. I've handed most work over to Quincy."

Quincy Evans, currently toiling away in the lab: Achoo! Achoo! How noble! How impressive!

Alexander asked her, "Have you had breakfast?"

Sophia nodded. "Yes. You?"

"I have too. Any plans for today?"

Sophia thought for a moment. "Nothing much, just reviewing some papers."

"A friend from Yunnan Province sent a case of wild mushrooms. You can have them."

Wild mushrooms?

These were a real treat.

"Give them to me? Don't you want them?"

Alexander laughed. "I rarely cook. They'll go bad if kept too long. You're the best person to have them."

"Okay then, I won't stand on ceremony!"

They went upstairs together.

Sophia entered Alexander's apartment and saw a large foam box behind the door.

Opening it, she found various mushrooms: Termitomyces, Old Man of the Woods, truffles, morels…

It was like a complete collection of Yunnan's winter fungi.

Each type was vacuum-sealed in separate packaging.

They were still remarkably fresh despite transportation and storage.

Sophia treasured them immediately. "Professor, these are so hard to find on the market. Are you sure you don't want them?"

Alexander waved his hand, practically pushing the box toward her. "Take them, take them."

"Great~ Come over for mushroom hot pot tonight!" With that, she happily picked up the box and headed home, not giving Alexander a chance to refuse.

At 5 PM, Alexander arrived punctually to help.

Entering the kitchen, he saw Sophia had already washed and drained all the mushrooms, setting them aside.

Alexander sounded almost disappointed. "Why didn't you wait for me to wash them?"

Sophia replied, "I had time this afternoon. Just took care of it."

"You stole my job," the man said, his tone feigning complaint.

Sophia giggled. "Professor, there's no pay for working here. Why are you so eager?"

"Haven't you heard 'the mouth of a guest is soft'? I wouldn't feel right eating without helping."

"Well, 'the hand that receives is soft' today too. I got all these mushrooms from you."

"So?"

Sophia declared, "We're even."

No soft mouth, no soft hand.

Soon, the hot pot was on the table.

The milky white broth floated with red dates, goji berries, and scallion segments.

Sophia added the first batch of mushrooms, then ran to her bedroom to fetch a timer.

She set it and started the countdown.

The essential Yunnan hot pot ritual was complete!

Alexander waited and waited. "Why does time feel so slow now?"

Sophia watched the mushrooms bubbling in the pot, swallowing saliva. "Almost there, just two more minutes."

Ding!

Time's up!

They both picked up their chopsticks simultaneously and dug in!

On a chilly early spring evening, what could be more blissful than a pot of steaming clear broth with wild mushrooms and a compatible dining companion?

Nothing.

They finished the first pot and started a second.

All the prepared mushrooms went into the pot, eaten cleanly without a single waste.

Finally, a small half bowl of hot broth each—

Alexander sighed contentedly. "A bit full."

Sophia secretly stifled a burp: Likewise.
###Chapter 284

They washed the dishes together.

They tidied the kitchen together.

Finally, they went out together to take out the trash.

Sophia pulled on her down jacket and picked up a trash bag.

Alexander brought out two bags from his apartment.

"Professor, how long has it been since you took out the trash?"

Alexander was silent for a moment. "Two weeks?"

Sophia raised an eyebrow.

She never imagined the professor had this side to him.

Fortunately, it was all packaging and plastic bags.

No perishable waste.

"Let's go."

They met an elderly couple from their building on the way down.

The couple had just taken out their trash and were holding hands on their way back.

"Alexander, Sophia, taking out the trash too?"

Alexander nodded.

The old woman looked at Sophia. "What delicious thing did you make today, Sophia? The smell drifted all the way downstairs!"

Sophia replied, "Wild mushroom hot pot."

"Was it that box of mushrooms Alexander got yesterday?"

Alexander had run into the old woman when he picked up his delivery yesterday.

He had casually asked her about mushroom storage methods.

Sophia nodded.

The old woman laughed even more cheerfully. "One provides the ingredients, the other provides the skill! Being neighbors is fate! You're so well-suited, you might as well get together!"

The older generation spoke directly.

Sophia froze.

Alexander cleared his throat softly.

She quickly waved her hands. "It's not what you think…"

The old woman cut her off. "No need to explain, as long as you're happy! Old man, let's go home!"

The old man smiled. "You're talking nonsense again, embarrassing the kids."

"What nonsense? Didn't we meet as upstairs-downstairs neighbors back in the day? Things were so conservative then. Now we should create opportunities for the young people…"

The couple's voices faded into the distance.

Sophia's cheeks felt warm.

Alexander's gaze drifted away.

They descended the stairs in silence.

They threw out the trash in silence.

"I—"

"You—"

They spoke at the same time.

Their eyes met.

They both laughed.

Sophia said, "That old couple is so loving. They've truly grown old together."

Alexander explained, "They are retired MIT professors from the astrophysics department. No children. 
###Chapter 285

They've supported each other their whole lives."

"That's impressive?" Sophia was surprised.

The couple seemed cultured.

She hadn't expected them to be MIT professors.

And studying astrophysics, no less.

"Why didn't they have children?"

Alexander took off his scarf and wrapped it around Sophia.

"Want to take a walk? Help the food settle?"

His movements were natural and fluid.

The light coffee-colored scarf felt soft.

It carried his body warmth and a faint woody scent.

Sophia had always wondered if he wore cologne.

But she never felt comfortable asking.

"Thank you, Professor. I forgot to bring my scarf…"

Actually, she had been lazy.

She thought she wouldn't need a scarf just to take out the trash.

Alexander saw through it but didn't comment.

"Professor Levi Grandelle had health issues and couldn't have children."

In that era, infertility was like a death sentence.

The Shaw Family pressured him to divorce.

Professor Grandelle, full of guilt, suggested breaking up.

Professor Zachary Rosedale firmly refused.

"I heard he published a notice in the newspaper cutting ties with his family. They didn't speak for twenty years. Later, his family gradually accepted it, and they reconnected."

But the relationship was already distant.

Professor Grandelle was an orphan.

Professor Rosedale became an orphan for her.

From then on, they only had each other.

Sophia was pensive. "Those were different times. Things moved slower. A lifetime was long enough to love just one person."

She looked into the distance.

Alexander looked at her.

You gaze at the scenery, yet you are the scenery.

Sophia exhaled a puff of white air. "Will it snow this year?"

Last year, there were only a few flurries.

The year before, when it snowed, she was busy arguing with Ethan Roscente.

She had missed the beautiful moment.

They walked for twenty minutes.

The walk definitely helped their digestion.

Alexander noticed her huffing warm air into her hands. "Let's head back."

"Okay."

Under the moonlight, they walked side by side back home.

…

Early the next morning.

A knocking sound woke Sophia.

"Sophia—"

It was Alexander's voice.

She sat up abruptly and opened the door.

"Professor? What's wrong?"

She thought something serious had happened.

Alexander paused. "Get dressed first. It's snowing."

Only then did Sophia realize she was still in her pajamas.

Even though they were long-sleeved and full-length, she felt slightly embarrassed.

"It's snowing? Really?"

"Look outside."

Sophia pulled back the curtains.

She pushed open the balcony door.

A cold wind hit her face.

A world of white greeted her eyes.

The eaves and tree branches were laden with pure white snow.

Snowflakes drifted down like feathers.

Like letters from heaven.

"It really is snowing—"

"It's so beautiful!"

Alexander chuckled from the doorway. "Go wash up. I'll wait for you downstairs."

"Okay—"
Sophia Sullivan hastily pulled on her down jacket.

Her scarf was tied haphazardly as she ran.

Children had already gathered downstairs to play in the snow.

This year's first snow arrived unexpectedly.

Everyone was thrilled.

Alexander Laurent stood beneath the snow-laden tree.

His gaze held an amused warmth as he watched her.

Sophia jogged closer.

Only then did she notice the round bucket at his feet.

It was filled with tools for playing in the snow.

There were seven or eight different types of snowball molds.

Small shovels and rakes were all there.

"These..." she blinked.

Alexander said softly, "I prepared them for you."

The tips of Sophia's ears turned pink. "Professor, I'm not a child anymore."

Five minutes later—

"Professor! Look at this little bear snowball!"

"This rabbit one is so realistic too!"

"The snow over there is whiter, help me shovel some over—"

She waved the snowball mold excitedly.

Passing neighbors glanced their way.

No one from the South could understand this obsession with snow.

Alexander let her boss him around.

A look of indulgent amusement never left his eyes.

...

In the lab, Professor Quincy Evans was frantic.

"Why isn't Alexander Laurent here yet?"

Dr. Simon Lowell whispered a reminder, "Professor Laurent took the day off."

"Off? Since when?"

"He sent an email last night... also said you're temporarily in charge of the lab."

Quincy stared at the erroneous data, his vision darkening.

Dr. Zoe Langley gazed out the window and sighed. "The snowscape at The Louvre must be stunning."

Simon chimed in, "The tickets are impossible to get."

"You want to take Lillian Lopez?"

"Yeah, I've been studying a bunch of photo tutorials."

Zoe looked at his earnest, grinning face and hesitated.

In the end, she just patted his shoulder.

...

Sophia was enjoying herself when a hand closed around her wrist.

Her gloves were soaked through.

Her fingertips were bright red from the cold.

Alexander confiscated all the tools.

"Time to go back."

Sophia trailed closely behind him.

"Can't I play a little longer, really?"

"Your boots are soaked."

She looked down and saw her boots were wet with melted snow.

She hadn't even noticed.

She obediently went home to change.

When she came out, Alexander was already waiting by the door.

"Shall we go see the snow at The Louvre?"

Sophia was stunned. "Now? But there are no tickets."

"Just follow me."

He led her through a side entrance.

The vision of red walls against white snow suddenly filled her view.

Sophia ran beneath the colonnade and turned back.

Snowflakes dusted his shoulders.

"Professor! Come over here—"

Alexander watched her joyful figure.

A line of poetry suddenly came to mind.

Standing together in the falling snow, sharing hair turned white.

He smiled and answered, "Okay."

...

They returned home in the evening.

Even after her shower, Sophia was still lost in the memory of the snowscape.

The image of his figure against the red wall was vivid in her mind.

...

All the paperwork was finalized.

Funding, site, and approvals were all in place.

The lab construction was officially on the agenda.

Sophia spent the entire day drawing up blueprints.

She listed detailed requirements.

Now, all that remained was selecting the right construction firm.

The three of them carefully deliberated over the list.

Since they were building it, it had to be the absolute best.
###Chapter 286
Still Feeling a Bit Defeated

Sophia Sullivan's fingertips glided across her tablet screen.

"Laboratories have extremely high qualification requirements for construction firms."
"It's completely different from standard residential projects."

"The layout of the security system post-construction is also crucial."
"This poses a significant challenge for most construction companies."

The three of them sat in a corner of the café.

Sophia took a sip of her coffee.
She shared the information she had found with the other two.

Hannah Morse had two strawberry cakes in front of her.
She was focused on eating, but her ears were perked up high.

"My dad knows quite a few engineering crews."
"Several have projects even here in the city."
"But I asked yesterday, they only know how to build regular apartment buildings."
"They don't know how to construct laboratories."

Sophia sighed softly.
"Specialized work requires specialized people."

Marcus Lawrence adjusted his glasses.
"It's best to hire a separate designer."
"They can act as a bridge between us and the construction company."
"Otherwise, information asymmetry will lead to a subpar final product."

The next few days were a whirlwind for the trio.

Apart from attending classes, all their time was spent running around outside.

They visited several well-known firms in the industry.
None were particularly satisfactory.

Either the designers didn't understand lab construction.
Or the budgets were shockingly high.

"I can't do it anymore, I can't walk another step, let's rest..."
After visiting two companies, Hannah collapsed into a chair, exhausted.

Marcus wasn't having any luck either.

Sophia's search... was even less successful.

Hannah downed two glasses of iced cola.
She instantly revived.
"I refuse to believe we can't find someone in this entire city who knows how to build a lab!"

"I have an appointment with another company at five."
"They have all the proper qualifications and a good reputation."
"I'll go check them out first." Sophia glanced at her watch. It was 4:20. A taxi would get her there just in time.

Before she could hail a cab, her phone rang.

"Hello?"

"Sophia, are you busy? It's Ryan Sullivan."

"Big Brother?"

They hadn't been in contact since the old lady's birthday banquet.
Coupled with their infrequent calls, Sophia didn't recognize his voice immediately.

"I'm handling some business near MIT. Want to grab a bite?"

Just then, a text came in from the construction company.
The designer had an emergency and couldn't meet.

Sophia readily agreed. "Sure!"

The siblings met at a small restaurant off campus.

Ryan was already there when Sophia arrived.

He was very tall and lean.
He wore a suit with an overcoat, which he had taken off and placed beside him after entering.

He looked tired after a long day.

But the moment he saw Sophia, he broke into a smile.
"I've been meaning to ask you out for a meal."
"But I've been swamped with work."
"And I figured you just started the semester, probably busy too."
"It got delayed until now."

Sophia smiled. "You're too polite, Big Brother. Today works perfectly. No time like the present."

"Yes, yes," Ryan nodded repeatedly. "Order whatever you like. My treat."

"Big Brother seems to be in good spirits?"

Unlike their last meeting in the other city, although Ryan looked weary, his eyes were bright.

It seemed things were going well for him lately.

Ryan waved his hand modestly.
"Just landed a project."
"The company's been established for a while now."
"Finally got a proper contract."
"Not making much, but it's a good start."
"Order whatever you want. Don't hold back."

Sophia was happy for him. "Alright, then I'll order!"

"Go ahead!"

Despite saying that, Sophia only ended up ordering two meat dishes, one vegetable dish, and a soup.

Ryan: "...That's it?"

"Mm, it's enough."

"No way, let's add two more dishes."

"Really, no need! We can't finish all this between two people!"
"Big Brother, are you determined to be a spendthrift today?"

Actively asking to be fleeced.

Ryan laughed. "Getting fleeced by my little sister once in a while isn't so bad."

"Really, it's unnecessary. Let's not waste food."

"Okay, I'll listen to you."

Ryan ordered two cans of beer.

The food arrived quickly.
The siblings chatted as they ate.

"How's school? Settling in okay?"
"Did you save my number?"
"Call me directly if you need any help."

Being in a foreign place together, siblings naturally should look out for each other.

Sophia: "It's alright. Ran into some issues, but I can handle them for now."

"That's good, that's good. Have some more..."
Ryan smiled and urged her to eat.

Midway through the meal, his phone rang.
He glanced at the screen.
"Sophia, you keep eating. I need to take this."

"Okay."

Five minutes later, Ryan returned and sat down.

Sophia could tell immediately something was wrong.

"Big Brother, eat some more."

"...Oh! Okay!" Ryan nodded quickly.
Though he tried to maintain a smile, it looked forced.

Sophia put down her chopsticks. "What's wrong, Brother?"

Hearing this, the man over six feet tall instantly had red-rimmed eyes.

"Sometimes I just don't understand these clients."
"We agreed on the project."
"We signed the contract."
"I spent so much time and effort on the planning and follow-up."
"Why do they change their minds so easily?!"

"Do they not understand contract spirit?"
"Do they not respect other people's labor?!"

"Maybe... it's my own problem."
"I haven't adapted to the brutal competition."
"My grasp of the market isn't good enough..."

He went from initial anger to pure dejection.

Sophia: "If the other party breaches the contract, you can claim damages."
"Getting paid without doing the work is pretty good."

"...What?" Ryan was stunned.

"You signed a contract. Does it have a breach of contract clause?"
"If yes, you can sue for liquidated damages."
"That kind of lawsuit is a sure win. The other party can't escape."

"Doesn't necessarily have to go to court."
"If they see you're determined, they might opt for an out-of-court settlement."
"You can negotiate the amount of damages then."

These were all things she learned when starting her business with Ethan Roscente.

Sophia not only handled contracts but also acted as a project manager and negotiator.

Ryan scratched his head awkwardly.
"...The contract doesn't have a breach clause."

Sophia: "...?"

Then he couldn't blame the other party for going back on their word.

Something with zero cost, of course they'd be unscrupulous.

No need to pay compensation anyway.

Ryan: "Sophia, how do you know all this?"

Uh...

"...Aren't these just basic knowledge for running a company?"

She swore she had no intention of being打击ing or sarcastic.

Ryan: "..." Still feeling a bit defeated.
###Chapter 287

Brother, will you take it?

Ryan Sullivan had been to college.
He should have known these basic things.
Important documents like contracts shouldn't be neglected.

"I've been too busy lately. The new project didn't have a reference template. I forgot to add the breach of contract clause when drafting it."
His first thought after the other party breached was their lack of professionalism.
That was naive.
Sophia's first thought was the compensation amount.

"You draft the contracts yourself?"
Ryan looked embarrassed. "My partner used to handle it. I only managed the construction site. He proposed dissolving the partnership half a month ago."
Ryan gritted his teeth and withdrew most of the tight cash flow to return the other party's initial investment.

Sophia frowned. "Did you calculate the operating losses?"
"...We need to calculate losses?"
"Of course. Profits are shared, so losses should be shared too."
The company was clearly not doing well. Why would he return the full principal after dissolution?
Even selling stocks after two seconds means bearing losses.
No business guarantees profit.

"Brother, if that's the case, I'd partner with you too."
Ryan fell silent.
Sophia sighed softly. "You can do the math. You just didn't want to hurt feelings over money, right?"
Ryan's eyes reddened.

"Clara... Am I useless? I don't know how to claim compensation. I even returned the full amount after dissolution..."
"No," Sophia said seriously. "You're just too decent. You don't prioritize money."
"He was my college roommate. We were like brothers for four years. I never thought..."
He never thought his most trusted person would leave during the hardest time.

"I don't blame him. I only blame myself for not being capable enough to keep people..."
Sophia's eyes suddenly lit up. "Brother, your company does smart home installation? What exactly do you do?"
Ryan explained seriously. "We use smart devices and AI control models to improve living conditions and make daily life more convenient."

Sophia pressed further. "Only home installation? Can you handle basic construction and lab design? Including smart system layout?"
Ryan replied, "We've done basic construction before, but competition was too fierce so we stopped. For lab design and smart system layout, we can do it if the client needs it."
"Clara, why are you asking this?"

Sophia's eyes sparkled. "I have a project, brother. Will you take it?"
Ryan was stunned. "...What project?"
"A smart lab. You'll have to handle the construction too."
Sophia wanted a highly intelligent laboratory.

The meal was rushed.
Ryan went back to his company to prepare a proposal immediately after hearing the requirements.
Sophia started a group call to explain the situation to Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence.
Both strongly agreed.
This was the best solution available.

That night, Sophia went home and organized detailed requirements to email to Ryan.
Early the next morning, Ryan called—
"Clara, no, Boss Sophia. I'll take this project! You are now my esteemed client!"
Sophia laughed. "Brother, it's not that serious..."
"It is! Rules are rules! If you're unsatisfied with anything, just say it. Don't think of me as your brother. Treat me as your service provider."

Sophia laughed even harder.
He meant business.
"Brother, you agreed without asking about the budget or discussing price? Aren't you afraid of losing money?"
Ryan said cheerfully, "No need."
"Why?"
"First, you won't let me lose out. Second, even if I don't make money, helping you and keeping the company running is worth it!"
"Brother..." Sophia sighed. "Don't be so honest in the future. You'll easily get taken advantage of."
His simple honesty was so much like David Sullivan.

They met at a small restaurant to discuss details that evening.
Sophia rushed there after class, briefly greeting Alexander Laurent on the way.
Alexander frowned, watching her hurried back.
Was it about the lab renovation again?

After the incident, he had contacted the academic affairs office.
Students weren't allowed to apply for other labs during the renovation period.
Rules were rules. He couldn't openly defy them.
He had wanted to invite her to his lab but was refused.
Alexander decided to find her an off-campus lab.
It couldn't be too far and had to be suitable.
He got a reply yesterday and arranged to see it today.
He would tell her after it was settled.
No point getting her hopes up prematurely.

Ryan had already ordered at the small restaurant.
Sophia was shocked by his current appearance the moment she sat down.
###Chapter 288

Dark circles hung heavily under Ryan Sullivan's eyes.

A shadow of stubble covered his jaw.

He looked as if he had aged ten years overnight.

He skipped eating and pushed a document toward Sophia.

"Mimi, this is the preliminary construction plan for the smart lab."

"I've supplemented and refined it based on the requirements you sent last night."

"A few areas could still be optimized."

"For example, the choice of containment doors."

"Considering potential exposure to harmful microorganisms or high-risk pathogens in a bio lab."

"I recommend these materials for the main door."

"I've prepared a comparative analysis across different metrics."

"Overall, the new GFRT composite material performs best."

"It offers superior sealing and malleability."

In just one day and night, Ryan had not only drafted the lab's overall framework.

He had perfected the details.

This level of work required a deep understanding of lab construction standards.

Sophia blinked. "Bro, did you cram last night?"

"Ahem..." Ryan cleared his throat softly. "Picked up some basics, and consulted a few experts."

But that wasn't the most surprising part.

What truly shocked her was—

Ryan: "I looked into it. Biosafety labs are classified by the risk level of the microbes and toxins they handle."

"The current national standard has four levels: BSL-1, BSL-2, BSL-3, and BSL-4."

"Mimi, I have a bold idea."

"What?"

"These four levels correspond to four sets of containment protocols."

"Since it's a smart lab."

"Could we design four or even more lab modes tailored to these different standards?"

One such lab would be the equivalent of N labs.

Purely smart-controlled, switching modes with zero manpower cost.

Sophia's eyes lit up. "Is that feasible?"

Ryan: "Very likely."

Sophia: "How likely?"

"Eighty percent."

Sophia: "And the budget?"

Ryan was silent for a moment. "Initial estimates exceed ten million."

She fell silent.

Indeed, you get what you pay for.

"The basic civil engineering is already coordinated. We can handle that."

"Good."

"Mimi," he said, suddenly serious. "Thank you for trusting me."

"I'll skip the formalities."

"All I can promise is to execute the plan meticulously, without cutting corners."

"Bro, I trust you."

Ryan smiled and scratched his head.

"Bro, what's the estimated timeline?"

He pondered for a long moment. "...Do you need it urgently?"

"Urgently. Very urgently."

"Within two months."

"So fast?!" Sophia was astonished.

Previous construction companies had quoted over six months.

The fastest had promised four.

Ryan was saying two months?

And "within" that?

He explained: "The most time-consuming part is the civil engineering."

"Once that's done, the smart fitting-out will be quick."

This was also thanks to Sophia's generous budget.

Money makes the world go round.

It truly could buy time.

"Good! The project is yours, Bro."

"Pick an auspicious day and start as soon as possible."

"As for..." she paused, "...the amount over budget, I'll make it up ASAP."

"Just focus on building it to the best possible standard!"

After finalizing things with Ryan, she grabbed a quick dinner.

Sophia immediately updated Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence.

Hannah: "Sophia, don't worry about the money. I'll ask my Pops for more..."

Back in his Guangdong home, watching TV, sipping tea, and fidgeting with walnuts, Henry Lorenz: "Achoo! Achoo!"

"Are you catching a cold?"

"Nonsense! My sweet girl is thinking of me!~"

"..."

Sophia sighed before Hannah could finish. "Won't your dad have a stroke if you agree without even asking him?"

Hannah chuckled. "Don't worry, he won't!"

"Money is just numbers to him."

"What I'm asking for isn't even enough to reduce those numbers by a zero."

"..." How offensive.

But Sophia still refused. "I'll cover the amount over budget."

"But—"

"No buts. It's settled."

Final decision!

Marcus cleared his throat softly. Hannah jumped. "If you stayed quiet any longer, I'd have forgotten you were here."

Marcus's voice was low. "...Sorry I couldn't help with the funding."

His family situation didn't allow for such a large cash outflow.

It wasn't that they didn't have it, but it would be hard to explain.

Sophia smiled. "Hannah and I have the money covered."

"Your role is elsewhere..."

Marcus: "?"

Sophia: "Secure all the lab's qualification certifications within two months."

"Complete all the administrative procedures."

"Ensure there are no loopholes for anyone looking to cause trouble."

"Can you do it?"

It wasn't paranoia, just preparedness.

Professor Victoria Lowell's team's recent actions had been eye-opening.

They had also made Sophia realize these people had no bottom line.

To prevent malicious reporting, she had to consider every possibility first.

And plan countermeasures in advance.

Marcus: "Okay. Leave it to me."

...

Ryan moved quickly.

Three days later, he picked an auspicious time to break ground.

Meanwhile, back at MIT, it was also the final deadline for the lab's relocation.

That morning, everyone from Professor Lowell's team was present except the professor herself.

Even the rarely-seen Caleb Watson made an appearance.

Shane Holloway buzzed around, practically wanting to sweep them out with a broom.

"...Hurry up! It's almost noon!"

"You had all that time before and didn't move, had to wait until the last minute."

"What's the point of struggling? You still have to leave anyway!"

Hannah pretended to gag. "Why do I feel sick just hearing you talk? Did you eat shit?"

Shane: "You're the one who eats shit! Your whole family eats shit!"

He stood far away, leaning forward with his hands on his hips.

No different from a shrew cursing in the street.

His posture almost made Hannah laugh.

"Have the guts to say that closer."

Shane wanted to get in her face, but remembered the last time all three of them had stomped on his feet.

Fear instantly took hold.

He swallowed. "Well... come over here if you dare!"

Hannah smiled and nodded. "Okay, I'm coming over now~"

She started moving equipment.

Shane panicked and scrambled back, eventually hiding behind Ashley Lowell.
###Chapter 289

Ashley Lowell took two steps back.

She was afraid Hannah Morse would hit her.

With that build, how much would a slap hurt?

She shoved Shane Holloway. "Hiding? Letting a girl shield you?"

Shane stumbled.

Amelia Roscente watched coldly.

She crossed her arms and stepped forward. "Hand over the key. Don't waste time."

Sophia Sullivan raised an eyebrow. "Why should I?"

Amelia narrowed her eyes. "Students aren't allowed to hold keys during lab renovations. It's the rule."

Sophia nodded. "You know it well."

Amelia held out her hand. "Then stop wasting time."

Sophia gave a light laugh. "But I don't want to give it to you."

"You—"

"You're not my advisor, and you're not from the Dean's office. Why should I give you the key?"

Amelia was speechless.

Professor Victoria Lowell had specifically instructed her to get the key yesterday.

She hadn't understood why.

What was so important about a rundown lab?

Then she remembered the CPRT Dynamometer.

Worth a fortune, and impossible to move.

Victoria was always like this, wanting to control everything.

Hannah Morse scoffed. "Some people are just greedy. They want everything, even if it means losing face."

Amelia's cheeks burned.

She truly looked down on this behavior.

But she needed Victoria's help.

Her graduation and thesis were in the other woman's hands.

Amelia's voice turned cold. "I don't have time to waste with you. Hand over the key."

Sophia spoke calmly. "You're too late. The key is already with my advisor."

"Which advisor?"

"Do I need to tell you?"

Amelia gritted her teeth. "Sophia Sullivan! Don't forget how you used to fawn over me! Why act all high and mighty now? You're just a stray our Jiang family—"

Smack!

The slap was sharp and clear.

Amelia covered her cheek, stunned. "You hit me?"

Sophia's gaze was icy. "Dirty mouth deserves a hit. This isn't your home. No one will indulge you here."

Ashley suddenly spoke up. "Hitting someone violates school rules. We can report you to the Dean's office."

Shane immediately agreed. "Right! We all saw it!"

Jude Granger hurriedly stepped between them. "Don't do this... We're all classmates..."

Shane shoved him away. "Get lost! You didn't say anything earlier, and now you play the good guy?"

Jude stumbled. "I just don't want this to escalate..."

He looked to Caleb Watson for help.

Caleb coolly glanced at Amelia. "If you insult someone, be prepared to get hit."

Amelia's eyes widened.

Shane didn't dare confront Caleb, so he turned his anger on Jude. "Whose side are you on? Traitor!"

The words were harsh.

Ashley's face changed.

Sophia looked at Hannah.

Their eyes met, and Hannah immediately stepped forward.

Smack! Smack!

Two crisp slaps landed on Shane's face.

Clean and efficient.

Shane was dazed. "You hit me?"

Hannah smiled and nodded. "Yeah. Why does everyone keep asking that?"

Shane, furious, tried to charge at her.

Jude held him back desperately.

Shane struggled and cursed. "I'm going to the Dean's office! Just wait to get expelled!"

Sophia chuckled. "Fine. Let's see who gets kicked out first."

Shane froze. "What do you mean?"

###Chapter 290

Sophia Sullivan looked up.

Assault and disorderly conduct were indeed different charges.

They had hit them, yes.

But only after being provoked first.

The department might side with Professor Victoria Lowell.

The university administration might not.

A proper investigation would look into the cause.

If the Dean's Office heard they got beaten up.

They would definitely ask why.

How would they answer then?

Admit they were breaking rules and coercing others?

Or that they hurled insults and personal attacks?

Maybe confess to kicking others when they were down and ganging up to mock them?

They got hit for being despicable.

That was more than enough to qualify as provocation.

If they get expelled, we all get expelled.

Everyone packs their bags and leaves.

Sophia finished with a smile.

The others stared, dumbfounded.

It could work like that?

She seemed quite pleased.

Hannah Morse immediately nodded.

Expulsion sounds good.

I can go home and help Pops collect rent.

Marcus Lawrence added calmly.

If expelled, I'll go back and take the civil service exam.

Even though they're unhinged.

If you can't beat them, join them.

Shane Holloway froze.

Ashley Lowell was stunned.

Amelia Roscente fell silent.

Jude Granger scratched his head and looked at Caleb.

Caleb was smiling.

Jude thought he was seeing things.

He looked closer. The smile was even brighter.

Sophia pressed her advantage.

Weren't we going to the Dean's Office?

Let's go. Together.

Saves the trouble of notifying everyone later.

She started heading downstairs.

Hannah and Marcus followed closely behind.

Why aren't you coming?

Hurry up.

It'll be lunch break soon.

Shane and Amelia exchanged uneasy glances.

Ashley was already completely lost.

The ones who threw the punches were more confident than the ones who got hit.

There must be a trap.

Shane stammered.

What proof do have that we started it?

Got any evidence?

I say you threw the first punch.

Sophia smiled slightly and pointed upward.

Surveillance.

Shane froze.

Since when did the lab have cameras?

Hannah answered for him.

We installed them ourselves.

To guard against people like you.

Shane was speechless.

Sophia added.

Pull up the recording and play it.

The whole story becomes clear.

Saves explaining. Quite convenient.

Shane swallowed hard.

He suddenly remembered something urgent.

I'll let you off today.

Next time, walk the other way when you see me.

He delivered his weak threat and scurried away.

Sophia looked at Amelia.

You? Coming with us?

I have things to do too.

Amelia turned and left.

Ashley called out after her.

Why is everyone leaving?

Cowards.

She cursed and left too.

They finished packing.

The three of them took a final look around the lab.

They were still reluctant.

Circumstances were forcing their hand.

Sophia, which professor did you give the key to?

I didn't. I still have it.

Hannah's eyes widened.

What if they press us?

Just say we gave it to Professor Alexander Laurent.

He'll definitely cover for us.

Her tone held reliance and trust.

Certain Alexander would take their side.

Sophia explained softly.

You handed your keys over.

I can't give up the one I have.

Why?

Silly. If we give all the keys away.

How do we move the CPRT? Break the door down?

Hannah's eyes went wide.

We can take the CPRT dynamometer?

Of course. We paid for it ourselves. Why couldn't we?

Exactly. We bought it. We can move it if we want.

So we need to keep a key.

Otherwise, it's inconvenient.

Marcus curled his lip.

Professor Victoria Lowell is trying so hard to push us out.

It's all for this machine.

Her clever plan is about to fail.

The three of them carried their boxes and left, locking the door behind them.

Each had one cardboard box.

Hannah's was the biggest, stuffed full of snacks.

Chips, nuts, spicy strips, cookies, milk, sparkling water.

A soccer ball flew toward them as they passed the field.

To dodge it, she threw her box.

The ball brushed past her arm.

Her snacks scattered everywhere.

Hannah was speechless.

Sophia and Marcus set their boxes down to help her pick everything up.

Someone was faster.

Caleb gathered the snacks and put them back in the box.

He picked it up and handed it to Hannah.

Thanks. Hannah was a bit dazed.

Were they on good terms?

Why was he suddenly helping her?

Seeing Caleb, Sophia and Marcus exchanged a look.

She stepped forward with a smile.

Thank you, Caleb.

He smiled. No need to be so wary.

I didn't catch up to help you argue.

Sophia raised an eyebrow. Then why?

Caleb was silent for a few seconds.

Believe it or not.

That first time we applied for the lab.

I didn't intentionally take more than my share.

Coming with them this time.

Wasn't to watch the show either.

This didn't surprise Sophia.

During that earlier confrontation, Caleb's shock seemed genuine.

This time, he just followed them in and stood to the side without participating.

He spoke up fairly at a key moment.

Said Amelia deserved to get hit.

Her intuition told her he wasn't bad.

But she didn't fully trust him either.

Dwelling on the past was pointless.

It's better to focus on the present.

That makes sense. He nodded gently.

His gaze swept over their boxes on the ground.

Are you planning to give up on the lab?

Sophia's heart skipped a beat, but her expression remained calm.

Why do you say that?

This fire safety review clearly has issues.

I heard you went to see Dean Cunningham.

But nothing happened after that.

That's not like you.

Not like us? Then what should we be like?

At the very least, you should fight for your rights.

Not take any crap, like when you slapped them.

That's your usual style.

Now you're packing up and slinking away.

It doesn't add up.

Caleb sensed anomalies keenly.

You've thought of a solution, haven't you?
###Chapter 291

Sophia Sullivan already had a plan.

She just wouldn't tell Caleb Watson.

"There's always a way," she said calmly.

Caleb smiled. "Then I wish you success."

He turned to leave.

"Wait." Sophia stopped him. "You can't live in someone else's shadow forever. Sometimes you have to be selfish and think about yourself."

Caleb paused. "Thank you. I understand."

...

"You didn't get the key?" Professor Victoria Lowell's face darkened instantly. "You couldn't handle such a simple task?"

Amelia Roscente frowned. "Sophia said she couldn't give it out against the rules. Was I supposed to snatch it from her?"

She was tired of Victoria's accusatory tone.

She was the one asking for a favor, yet she acted so superior.

"Professor Lowell, what's so special about that old lab? Why are you so fixated on it?"

"We already have the CPRT Dynamometer. Why do we need the old one?"

Victoria stood up abruptly. "Why all the questions? If you were more competent, you'd have the key by now!"

Amelia let out a cold laugh.

She wasn't some pushover.

She had been polite to Victoria before because the professor helped her get into grad school.

But all those expensive gifts and the money for the CPRT had long been repaid.

"Professor Lowell, you should find someone else for these underhanded favors. Ashley seems perfect. She is your niece, after all."

Victoria's expression changed drastically.

She suppressed her anger. "My apologies. I was out of line. Thank you for your efforts."

Amelia left the office without looking back.

The moment the door closed, Victoria slammed her pen holder onto the desk.

...

The Roscente mansion.

Amelia called out as soon as she entered. "Martha, bring me an ice pack!"

Victoria Roscente hurried over. "What happened?"

"Mom, Sophia hit me!" She pointed tearfully at her cheek. "Look, it's swollen!"

Victoria was furious. "She dared to hit you?! How dare she!"

"I only said a few things to her, and she just attacked me..."

Victoria immediately looked for her phone. "I'm going to give that little bitch a piece of my mind!"

A servant handed her a phone.

She dialed Sophia's number, but only got a busy signal.

She then remembered she had been blocked long ago.

"Use your phone!" Victoria yelled at the servant.

This time, the call connected.

"Sophia Sullivan, you—"

The call was disconnected.

She tried calling again, only to get the busy signal once more.

Victoria trembled with rage. "How dare she treat me like this?!"

Amelia said coolly, "She doesn't want anything from our family anymore. Why wouldn't she dare?"

Victoria was taken aback.

She finally realized Sophia was no longer the little girl she could push around.

"Mom, just leave her alone from now on," Amelia said softly. "She's... not someone to be trifled with."

Victoria smashed the phone onto the floor.

The servants were too afraid to make a sound.

...

In the lab, Hannah Morse looked at Sophia curiously. "Who was that?"

"A telemarketer," Sophia said without batting an eye.

Marcus Lawrence frowned. "The old lab is unusable. The new one will take at least two months. What do we do about our research progress?"

The experiments couldn't be delayed.

Sophia thought for a moment. "I'll figure something out."

...

She returned to her apartment in the evening.

Sophia was unlocking her door.

The door across the hall suddenly opened.

Alexander Laurent stood in the doorway. "Sophia."

His eyes were gentle, carrying a faint smile.

Sophia was slightly surprised. "Professor, you didn't go to the lab today?"

"No." His gaze was intent. "I was waiting for you."

Sophia paused. "...Waiting for me?"
###Chapter 292

Alexander Laurent: To my place?

Wait for her.

Wait for her to do what?

"Is it something important?" Sophia Sullivan's expression turned serious.

"For you, it should be considered good news."

"What is it exactly?" Her eyes sparkled with curiosity.

The more he withheld, the more she wanted to know.

"I visited an old friend at the neighboring Stanford University yesterday."

Alexander Laurent mentioned a small request in passing.

"Professor Feng agreed to allocate a fully-equipped biology lab, including a CPRT Dynamometer."

"Really?! That's fantastic!"

Sophia nearly jumped for joy.

It was a godsend.

She had been worrying about lab space, and Alexander had already solved it for her.

Like a stray kitten suddenly finding a shelter.

And a fully furnished one at that.

Overcome with emotion, she grabbed his sleeve. "Professor, you're the best!"

Her eyes shone brilliantly.

Even through the fabric, he could feel the warmth of her palm.

Their eyes met, and the corner of his mouth lifted slightly.

Sophia suddenly realized she was being too familiar.

She quickly released his sleeve. "Sorry, Professor. I was just so happy."

She didn't notice the fleeting disappointment in his eyes. "It's fine."

"To show my gratitude, you're coming to my place for dinner tonight! No refusals!" She declared before darting back to her apartment.

A light rekindled in the man's gaze.

...

Alexander entered Sophia's apartment, removed his coat, rolled up his sleeves, and walked into the kitchen.

Washing vegetables, chopping, peeling garlic...

He anticipated her needs before she could even ask.

He moved with the ease of someone in his own home.

Their numerous collaborations had forged a seamless tacit understanding.

A mere gesture from Sophia, and Alexander knew if she needed salt or sugar, a bowl or a plate.

Before six, a spread of two meat dishes, two vegetable dishes, and a soup adorned the table.

Outside, the wind howled, but inside, it was warm and cozy.

Knowing Alexander didn't drink and discouraged her from it, Sophia didn't even offer.

"Thank you, Professor, for helping me yet again."

"Thank you, Sophia, for another wonderful meal."

"So... mutual appreciation?" She grinned.

Alexander nodded solemnly. "Precisely."

Braised Pork Ribs, Shredded Pork with Green Peppers, Stir-Fried Cabbage, Sautéed Three Vegetables, and Pork Bone with Radish Soup.

The portions were modest, but each dish was delicious. They finished everything.

Alexander sighed softly. "I've been putting on weight lately..."

The clatter of dishes Sophia was gathering drowned out his words. "Professor, what did you say?"

"Nothing... Let me help."

He joined her in clearing the table.

By now, Sophia rarely needed to wash dishes; Alexander had mastered the task.

She simply stood by, taking the washed and rinsed plates to dry and put away.

Noticing his white sweater, she asked, "Professor, would you like an apron?"

He glanced down. "Probably wise. My hands are wet. Could you help me?"

"Sure."

Sophia fetched the apron but hesitated.

He was too tall. She had to stand on her toes and reach up just to loop it over his head.

As she wavered, Alexander suddenly bent down. "Is this better?"

"...A little lower."

"Like this?" He leaned further.

"Yes, that's good."

She quickly slipped the apron over his head.

Alexander straightened up. After a moment, seeing her still, he reminded her with a smile, "It needs to be tied at the back."

"...Oh! Right!" Flustered, she grabbed the ties and fastened them into a bow behind his back.

"Ahem—" Alexander suddenly coughed.

"What's wrong?"

"...A bit tight."

"Sorry! Let me adjust it... How about now?"

"That's fine."

After cleaning the kitchen, they moved to the living room.

Sophia prepared a fruit platter and set it on the coffee table.

"Professor, some fruit."

"Thank you."

She took a piece of apple and sat on the opposite end of the sofa. "I heard CBS will broadcast the academic conference between MIT and Caltech?"

"Yes. Would you like to watch?"

Sophia nodded, then deflated. "My TV doesn't get international channels. Even with a VPN, I can only watch replays..."

"We can watch it."

"Huh?!"

Alexander: "Come to my place."

Sophia followed Alexander next door.

It wasn't her first time visiting, but she usually stayed in the living room, rarely venturing into the bedroom.

The only exception was when she fetched a thermometer and cold medicine for him.

That time was too rushed to notice anything.

This time was different...

Alexander went to set up the projector while Sophia stood in the room, taking in her surroundings.

The same layout, the same master bedroom size, but the decor was worlds apart.

From the style of the bed and wardrobe to the color scheme of the sheets and curtains...

Sophia's place was warm Morandi tones; his was stark black, white, and grey.

Rational restraint was etched into his bones, evident even in these domestic details.

Though monochromatic, the room was impeccably tidy.

One nightstand held an alarm clock and charger; the other, a small bookshelf.

Academic journals were neatly arranged on the shelves.

Whoosh—

Alexander drew the curtains.

The projector whirred to life, casting a screen of light onto the white wall.

He operated his phone, switching to the CBS live stream.

"Oh my god! It really works!" Sophia exclaimed in delight.

The camera panned, revealing Professor Eleanor Watson sitting in the front row!

"It's my professor!"

Craning her neck grew uncomfortable. She looked for a seat but found none in the room, only...

"If you don't mind, you can sit on the bed."

Sophia hesitated. "This..." Isn't that a bit inappropriate?

A bed was a private space.

Just as she disliked others touching her bed, she felt awkward about using someone else's.

Alexander explained, "I just changed the sheets yesterday. They're clean."

"It's not that!" Sophia waved her hands quickly. "I'm afraid of dirtying your bed..."

"You won't."

He handed her a pillow, gesturing for her to lean back comfortably.

"...This pillow is new. I haven't used it."

Sophia stood awkwardly, unsure whether to sit or remain standing.

Noticing her discomfort, Alexander finally realized his invitation might have been too forward.

He immediately offered, "Wait a moment. I'll get a chair from the living room."
###Chapter 293

Sophia Sullivan sat directly on the carpet.

She crossed her legs.

"This is fine."

The plush carpet was soft and comfortable.

Its quality was evident at first touch.

It wasn't the least bit uncomfortable to sit on.

She could even lean her back against the edge of the bed.

She thought to herself.

It would be even more perfect with some snacks and drinks.

Alexander Laurent walked in carrying an armful of snacks.

Nuts, chips, and two bottles of lime juice.

Sophia's eyes lit up.

The professor understood her perfectly.

Alexander set the snacks down.

He also sat on the carpet.

He placed a pillow behind each of them.

They watched the live stream while eating, drinking, and chatting.

They continued until the stream ended.

Sophia checked the time and saw it was almost eleven.

She immediately got up to leave.

Alexander saw her to the door.

He waited until she entered her own apartment before turning back.

While cleaning up, he noticed the two pillows.

His own was already pressed out of shape.

Sophia's only had a few slight wrinkles.

Alexander picked up her pillow.

He smoothed the wrinkles with his palm.

A faint scent suddenly drifted into his nostrils.

He froze on the spot.

A physical reaction made him curse under his breath in annoyance.

It was the first time he felt so useless.

But he was powerless to change this state.

He knew it would happen again next time.

He took a deep breath.

It was just too difficult.

Even his most challenging research project hadn't been this hard.

...

Next door, Sophia went to sleep right after her shower.

She quickly drifted into dreamland.

Unaware that someone was tossing and turning, unable to sleep, because of a pillow.

...

Saturday's sunlight was unusually bright.

Sophia had no classes and decided to check on the construction site's progress.

She didn't tell Ryan Sullivan in advance.

So he was quite startled when he saw his sister.

"What are you doing here?"

Sophia almost didn't recognize her brother either.

His gray work clothes were covered in dust.

Dried mud was caked on his red hard hat.

Blending in with the workers, he looked completely natural.

"Bro, it hurts to see you like this."

Ryan was taken aback for a moment before laughing.
###Chapter 294

"Silly girl, what are you thinking?"
"Even the CEO would have to dress like this if he came."
He noticed Sophia wasn't wearing a hard hat.
He quickly snagged one from a coworker.

"Wear this for now, I'll buy you a new one later."
The coworker grunted twice.
He hardly ever wore that hat himself.

Sophia stood on a pile of rubble and looked out.
The ground was still flat.
The scaffolding hadn't even been erected yet.

Ryan reported on the project's progress.
"I was planning to update you tomorrow."
"Since you're here, I'll tell you in person."

"The foundation was dug yesterday."
"But I modified the plans to go three centimeters deeper."
"It's for future optimization and expansion considerations."
"The imported materials have been ordered."
"They'll arrive within a month, perfect timing."

Sophia asked directly and sharply.
"Is the progress different from what was originally promised?"

Ryan sighed inwardly.
Nothing could escape her notice.

"It is indeed slower."
"We're short-handed."

Sophia raised an eyebrow.
She thought it was some major problem.

Ryan's company had long stopped handling civil engineering.
But Sophia insisted they take this project together.
He understood her lack of trust.

He contacted his old engineering team.
Over twenty people should have been enough.
But after modifying the plans, the workload increased.
They no longer had enough manpower.

Sophia asked, "Is this a long-term problem?"
Ryan nodded, "We might need to adjust the plans further later."
"Our current manpower isn't enough."

"Find two more engineering teams?"
Ryan didn't know whether to laugh or cry.
"Engineering teams aren't cabbages you can just pick."
"The good ones are all booked solid."
"Paying more won't even cover their breach penalties."

Sophia was puzzled, "You can't find one even if you pay?"
Ryan shook his head, "The risk is too high if we don't know them."
"I don't recommend hiring just anyone."

Sophia sighed.
"Don't worry, I'll think of something."
"Let me take you to eat first?"

"Thanks, bro."
"Since when are you so polite, little girl..."

A small diner nearby.
The site's boxed lunches were ordered from here.
Ryan usually ate here with the crew.
Today he brought his sister to the shop.

"Boss lady, two rice bowls!"
"Oh, little boss Ryan brought family?"
"This is my sister."
"No wonder she's so pretty!"

The proprietress greeted them warmly.
She turned to start cooking.

"We were here first, why are they cutting in line?"
"The boss is inspecting today, this is so embarrassing."
A calm male voice spoke.
"Let them go first."
He wore work clothes but had an extraordinary presence.

"Mr. Sterling—we're also in a hurry..."
The man tried to argue.
Sebastian Evans frowned, his tone impatient.
"Are we listening to you or to me?"

The man immediately fell silent.

The familiar voice made Sophia Sullivan instinctively turn her head.

Ryan Sullivan happened to call out to her.
"Sophia, come sit over here."

Sebastian whirled around.

Their eyes met, and both froze for a moment.

Sebastian recovered first, a flicker of pleasant surprise in his eyes.
"What are you doing here?"

"Looking at a construction site."

"You? Looking at a construction site?"

Sophia raised an eyebrow.
"I can't?"

"No... you're not in this industry. What are you looking at? For fun?"

Sophia cleared her throat lightly.
"I own some land here. I'm planning to build. Is that allowed?"

"Here? You own land?"

A thought suddenly occurred to Sebastian, his eyes shifting slightly.
"The plot Ethan Roscente gave you?"

"How did you know?" Sophia's eyes widened.

The man snorted softly.
###Chapter 295

"I know everything about you two."

Back when Ethan was considering gifting the land, he had asked for Sebastian's opinion.

Sebastian had frowned the moment he saw the transfer contract.

He thought Ethan was being stingy, and felt Sophia deserved better.

Their jointly founded company went public, and all the co-founder got was a check and a piece of land?

Was he treating her like a beggar?

Only Sophia would put up with him.

Anyone else would have flipped the table.

Sebastian had been green with envy at the time.

How did a guy like Ethan get to meet someone like her?

He was just one step too late...

Just one step!

"Sebastian? What are you thinking about?" Sophia called his name twice.

"Ahem... just thinking about an idiot. What did you ask me?"

"What are you doing here?"

"I have a resort project. Construction started last month. I'm here to check on it."

Sophia blinked.
"You're into physical projects now?"

She remembered Sebastian mainly focused on financial investments, chasing quick money.

A slight smile touched Sebastian's lips.
"You know what I do?"

It seemed she had been paying attention to him...

Sophia found his question odd.
"Weren't you guys always talking about this stuff at your gatherings? I just picked it up from listening."

"Not only do I know you're in finance, but I also know Charlie Lowell is into entertainment."
"Julian Winston dabbles in a bit of everything, whatever's hot. Doesn't put all his eggs in one basket."

Sebastian fell silent.

The smile instantly vanished from his lips.

Ryan Sullivan sat not far away, his frown deepening the more he watched.

Hitting on Sophia right in front of him? This guy didn't look trustworthy...

He immediately stepped forward and took Sophia's hand.
"Sweetie, let's go sit over there."

Sweetie?!

And he's holding her hand?!

Sebastian's face darkened instantly, his gaze on Ryan's hand sharp as a knife.

The key point was, Sophia didn't pull away?!

She even nodded obediently.
"Okay."

Just like that, she went with him?

Sebastian was so angry his eyes reddened. Who was this guy?

Usually, she'd jump away if he so much as touched her. How come with this guy...

He had been chatting with the restaurant owner earlier, and Sebastian hadn't paid any attention!

"Mr. Evans... your phone!" The project manager reminded him timidly.

Sebastian shot him a cold glance and ended the call.

The project manager broke out in a cold sweat.

...

The siblings had already started eating.

Ryan asked, "How is it?"

Sophia nodded.
"It's good!"

"The owner specializes in serving construction sites. The food is tasty and the portions are generous."

"Eat more meat—" Ryan picked out the shredded pork and put it on her plate before starting to eat himself.

"Ryan, that's too much."

"Not at all! Look how thin you are. You need to eat more to gain some weight."

Sophia sighed silently. A brother's love, expressed entirely through meat.

"That guy just now didn't look like a good person. You need to be more careful when you're out. Don't think your big brother is nagging. Bad people don't have 'villain' written on their faces..."

Ryan's sense of big brother responsibility was off the charts.

With their uncle and aunt not around, he had to take on the responsibility of educating his younger sister.

Beware of fire, theft, and troublemakers—

Sebastian had completely lost his appetite.

Watching that guy serve Sophia food, and her accepting it!

It made him so angry his eyes reddened, his jaw clenched tight.

The starving project manager beside him was on the verge of tears.

The boss's expression was getting darker and darker, the aroma of the food was tempting, but he couldn't touch it...

Suddenly—

Sebastian picked up his plate and walked over.

"Sophia, mind if I join you?"

He thought he was being suave.

In reality—

He wore dusty work clothes and a ridiculously outdated hard hat, looking no better than Ryan.

Sophia paused for a second.
"Not at all. Have a seat!"

She even smiled at him.

As Sebastian walked over, an idea flashed in Sophia's mind.

He had a resort project here. He must have a lot of workers, right?

Maybe she could...

Her mental abacus started clicking away.

Sebastian only saw her smiling at him.

His heart instantly soared.

He shot a挑衅 look at Ryan: Who do you think you are?

Ryan was baffled.
"?"

This ginger is pretty bold
"Sophia, you know him?" Ryan Sullivan asked coolly.

Sophia nodded.
"We do."

"Of course we do!" Sebastian Evans said at the same time.

Ryan raised an eyebrow, looking him over from head to toe and back again.
His expression grew more disdainful with each passing second.

Sebastian wasn't bothered by the scrutiny.
He calmly pulled out a chair and sat down beside Sophia.

Look all you want.
See how strong your competition is.
Be smart and bow out gracefully.

Ryan let out a derisive, "Hah!"

This blond punk was certainly arrogant.

"Sophia, aren't you going to introduce us?" Ryan lifted his chin slightly.
"This one... doesn't seem like someone you'd know."

What did he mean, "doesn't seem like someone you'd know"?!

What was that supposed to imply?

Sebastian immediately recognized the veiled insult.

Annoyingly, Sophia seemed unusually indulgent toward this man.
She actually started to make introductions.

"Yes, Sophia," Sebastian echoed, his tone equally insinuating.
"This gentleman doesn't seem like someone you'd know either.
Do introduce us."

Ryan's face darkened.

Their eyes locked.
In the silent standoff, a thousand unspoken challenges passed between them.

Sophia frowned, clearly sensing the tension.
But she didn't understand it.

What deep-seated grudge could two men meeting for the first time possibly have?

Why were they squaring off like fighting cocks?

"Fine, I'll introduce you both," she said.
"This is Sebastian Evans, a friend of mine.
He runs an investment firm.
This is Ryan Sullivan, my cousin.
He currently operates a smart home installation company."

"Any further questions?"

Sebastian blurted, "Your cousin?!"

Ryan exclaimed, "He's a boss?!"

They looked at each other, both slightly embarrassed.

"Ahem!" Sebastian recovered first, raising his teacup.
"My apologies.
I didn't realize you were Sophia's cousin.
My mistake.
Let me offer you this tea as a peace offering."

Seeing his sincere and straightforward manner, Ryan's irritation faded.

He raised his own cup in response.
"You're too kind, Mr. Evans."

"Sophia mentioned you're in smart home installation?" Sebastian asked.

"Yes.
Are you familiar with the industry?"

"I've invested in two companies in that sector." Sebastian named them.

Ryan looked surprised.
"Those are both pioneers in domestic smart home installation.
They've gone public in recent years and expanded significantly.
It seems you have a keen eye for investments."

"You flatter me.
Just casual investments.
Haven't lost money on them, at least."

Ryan smiled politely, not buying it for a second.

There was no such thing as a "casual" investment.
Real money was on the line.

You listened to such modesty, but believing it would be foolish.

"A boss in investments needs to personally visit construction sites?" Ryan asked.

"How else would I know if a project is worth investing in?" Sebastian countered.
"Check its progress?
See if the return meets expectations?"

Ryan followed up casually, "Which project are you referring to?"

"The Sky Dominion Resort."

"What a coincidence!
That's right next to ours!"

"Really?" Sebastian's eyebrows rose, a thoughtful glint in his eyes.
He seized the opportunity.
"And your project is?"

Ryan first glanced at Sophia, his meaning clear: Can I tell him?

She gave a slight nod.

Initially, they hadn't planned to disclose it.
But now, needing help, there was no point in being secretive.

"I'm helping Sophia build a smart lab," Ryan said.

"Build a lab?!" Sebastian was genuinely shocked.

Since it had come to this, Sophia naturally explained the whole story.

"...That's roughly the situation."

"Tsk," Sebastian's eyes narrowed dangerously.
"This Blake Cunningham really has a short memory..."

Sophia asked, "What?"

"Nothing.
How is the lab construction going?"

She pressed her lips together slightly.

Sebastian understood.
"Running into difficulties?
Tell me.
Maybe there's something I can do to help?"

Sophia had been waiting for exactly this.

"Yes!"

Absolutely!

There most certainly was!

Two minutes later—

"...So, your difficulty is a manpower shortage?
You want to borrow some workers from me?" And they were just basic construction laborers?

Sophia asked seriously, "Is that a problem?"

Sebastian shook his head.
"No."

"Then your expression just now..."

Sebastian said, "How do you think the knife feels when a blade meant for slaughtering cattle is used to kill a chicken?"

Sophia fell silent.

"You need people, right?
Will thirty be enough?
Or... forty?"

Sophia and Ryan exchanged a look.

Was this how the world of the ultra-wealthy worked?

Ryan, in particular, was wide-eyed, swallowing hard.

He retracted his earlier "blond punk" comment.

Some "blond punks" were not just "bosses" but could also casually produce dozens of workers on demand.

This was truly impressive.

Sebastian thought for a moment before deciding.
"I'll just assign you two full construction crews."

Ryan's eyes widened.
"!" This man was a godsend!

Sebastian asked, "Will that work?"

The siblings simultaneously shook their heads like rattles.
"No, no problem at all!"

...

That afternoon, Sebastian offered to drive Sophia home.

Ryan smiled.
"Won't that be too much trouble?
It's quite easy to get a taxi here..."

Sebastian had already changed out of his work clothes and removed his hard hat.
He now looked every bit the elite CEO.

Standing next to his red Ferrari, he said, "No trouble at all.
It's on my way."

An aura of wealth radiated from him.

Ryan stood watching the car's taillights disappear into the distance, murmuring to himself, "That's no blond punk.
That's a golden catch."

Still, as her elder cousin, he took out his phone and sent Sophia a text.

[Be careful.
Message me when you get home.]

Sophia put her phone away and couldn't help glancing at the man in the driver's seat.

Sebastian noticed.
"You look at me right after putting your phone away.
Something about me?"

Sophia shook her head.
"It's nothing..."

Even Ryan, meeting him for the first time, had sensed his intentions and warned her to be careful.

This was...

Sebastian, unaware of her wandering thoughts, continued.
"Both construction crews can start tomorrow.
However, they're under contract with my company for this year's projects.
Following proper procedure, my people have to assign them their work."

"Subcontracting or transferring their contracts would be a breach.
So, to avoid that, I'll need to be the one assigning tasks to these crews."

"It's really just a formality.
I've added Ryan on WeChat.
He'll send me the weekly work schedule in advance, and I'll forward it to the crews."

"Similarly, the progress reports from the crews will come to me first, and I'll relay them to Ryan.
Understand?
This means I'll be involved in your lab's construction from now on."

"Pleasure working with you, Ms. Sophia Sullivan."

After his lengthy explanation, Sophia couldn't help but smile.
"Couldn't these minor tasks be handled by the crew foreman?
Does a big boss like you really need to get involved personally?"

"Nothing concerning you is a minor task."
###Chapter 296

Sophia didn't answer.

Silence filled the car.

It lasted until the car stopped at the entrance of the alley.

"It's here," Sebastian said.

"Thank you for lending us the crew, Mr. Evans. My brother will settle the cost with you," Sophia replied.

"Alright."

He didn't refuse. His businesslike attitude made Sophia relax a little.

"Goodbye."

"Goodbye, Clara."

...

Ryan Sullivan moved quickly.

He took over the construction crew the next day.

They agreed on a price and signed the contract.

Work officially began on the third day.

"We've agreed," Ryan said. "You, me, and him. We'll have a weekly progress meeting."

Sophia frowned. "Do we need to include Sebastian Evans?"

She couldn't really let him act as a foreman.

Besides, Sebastian was so busy. He wouldn't have time for such a small matter.

"That's what I said," Ryan replied. "But he insisted on participating."

His reason was solid—

It's my crew. I need to take responsibility.

Workers and employees are the same. There's no difference.

"He also asked me to give you a message."

"What is it?"

"He said he's happy to be the one wielding the knife."

"..."

Ryan snorted. "Is that kid trying to chase you? His intentions are too obvious. But I respect his directness. He has good taste and courage. But Clara—"

His tone turned serious. "Men are unreliable. Don't let him fool you."

Sophia chuckled. "Don't worry, Ryan. He can't fool me."

After those six years with Ethan Roscente, she had finally broken free.

How could she possibly jump back into the fire of love?

Studying, experimenting, researching, writing papers—wasn't all that better?

Why bother with romance?

...

The week passed quickly.

Sophia, Marcus Lawrence, and Hannah Morse had already moved into the biology lab at Stanford University.

Apart from the inconvenience of traveling between the two universities, everything else went smoothly.

The cafeteria at Stanford—

Was especially delicious!

This delighted Hannah to no end.

She hadn't even finished her current meal before she started thinking about the next one.

"Ahem! Using this lab long-term wouldn't be so bad. Look, it's close to all three cafeterias. Just a short walk away..."

"Convenient for you to eat anytime, right?" Marcus saw right through her.

"Eating is the most important thing! Don't you eat when you're hungry?" Hannah retorted.

Marcus was stumped. "...I eat less. Three meals a day."

Hannah instantly bristled. "Are you making fun of me for eating more and having snacks? I didn't think you were that kind of person!"

"...No, I—"

"Don't explain! Explaining is just your trap! You organize these two sets of data yourself! I'm going for my fourth meal! Hmph!"

Marcus: "?"

"...You're really leaving?"

Hannah walked away without looking back.

Sophia silently packed her things. "I'm heading out too."

Marcus: "Wait..."

They're both leaving?

Sophia was going to eat, but not at the cafeteria. She was going to the small restaurant she had visited before with Ryan.

However, there was an extra person today...

By the time Sophia arrived, Ryan and Sebastian were already there.

The food had just been served, steaming hot.

All her favorite dishes.

Sophia pulled out a chair and sat down. "Have you been waiting long?"

"I just got here too," Ryan said. "Mr. Evans was the earliest."

Naturally, he had ordered the food.

Today was the trio's first weekly meeting.

Sebastian helped her hang up her bag before returning to his seat. "Shall we talk while we eat? The food won't taste as good when it's cold."

"Okay."

The three began to eat.

Sophia and Ryan were regulars here, so they were very casual.

Surprisingly, Sebastian seemed quite comfortable as well.

Then again, he could even eat boxed lunches at a construction site. What couldn't he accept?

A flicker of appreciation passed through Ryan's eyes.

"Ahem—" He finished two pieces of ribs and put down his chopsticks. "Let's start with this week's progress... The foundation is done, and we've started building the structure. The civil engineering is expected to be completed next week."

"So fast?" Sophia was a little surprised.

Ryan looked at Sebastian. "Thanks to Mr. Evans's crew."

You only realize the difference when you actually see them work.

They were far better than his own workers.

Naturally, progress was swift.

Sebastian picked up a piece of meat, his tone casual. "It's what should be done."

"About the payment..."

Sebastian interrupted. "Speaking of which, monthly payments are too troublesome. I'll cover the costs first, and you can settle everything with me once the project is finished. Don't worry, the accounts will be clear."

Ryan waved his hand. "Mr. Evans, you must be joking. A big boss like you wouldn't skim off our small change."

Sebastian's expression turned serious. "Business is business. Following the rules is better for everyone."

Ryan paused, then nodded. "...You're right. I was being too simplistic."

"Here's to that." Sebastian raised his glass.

Both were driving, so they were drinking soda.

"Cheers." Ryan raised his glass.

Sebastian looked at Sophia. "You join too. Since you're here."

"Alright." Sophia put down her chopsticks. "To the successful completion of the lab."

Their glasses clinked. Sophia took a sip.

The carbonation rushed up her nose.

She didn't really like cola.

Fortunately, she drank little and recovered quickly.

Sophia continued eating.

Sebastian called the waiter over. "Do you have coconut milk?"

"Yes, we do."

He looked at Sophia. "Get her a bottle."

The waiter asked, "Iced or room temperature?"

Sophia was momentarily stunned. "...Room temperature, thank you."

Soon, the coconut milk and a straw were delivered.

Sebastian pulled the tab, inserted the straw, and pushed it toward her.

His movements were practiced and utterly natural.

Just then, the hostess's "Welcome!" rang out.

A man and a woman walked in.

Sophia was facing the door. She looked up and her eyes collided with Ethan Roscente's.

He was slightly taken aback, then nodded calmly.

He tightened his arm around the woman beside him.
###Chapter 297

Sophia Sullivan’s gaze stilled.

A small eatery near campus.

Ethan Roscente would actually come to a place like this.

He’d only reluctantly visited a few times when he was pursuing her.

After they became official, he never set foot in one again.

But the next second, her pupils constricted sharply.

The woman in Ethan's arms…

It was actually Fiona Valentine?

Their intimate posture.

Clearly a couple.

When did they get together?

It wasn't that Sophia still had feelings for her ex.

It was purely…

Everyone loves gossip.

She would have reacted this way no matter who it was.

After all…

A juicy piece of gossip right in front of you. Who could resist?

Fiona followed Ethan's line of sight.

Seeing Sophia, she immediately smiled.

She walked over, holding the man's arm.

"What a coincidence, Sophia. I didn't expect to run into you here."

Sophia raised an eyebrow.

Sophia?

Were they that close?

But you don't hit someone who's smiling at you.

She curved her lips slightly. "Yeah."

And then nothing more.

Fiona's smile stiffened slightly. "Let me introduce you. This is my boyfriend, Ethan Roscente."

She affectionately held the man's arm.

"This is my classmate, Sophia Sullivan."

Sophia was speechless.

Did she ask?

Just launching into introductions?

Thanks a lot.

"Fiona, there are free tables inside."

The meaning was clear: Don't stand here. Go sit over there.

Pfft—

Sebastian Evans laughed.

From the moment Ethan walked in with the woman in his arms, he had a look of watching a good show.

He originally planned to quietly enjoy the drama.

But Sophia's bluntness amused him.

"Ahem! Sophia, give Mr. Roscente and his new girlfriend some face. Invite them to sit with us."

Sophia's mouth twitched. "Seriously? Are you for real?"

They were at a table for two.

They'd barely fit three by adding a chair.

Add two more?

Are you kidding?

She smiled slightly and looked at Fiona. "Sorry, we're full. There's no room. Those are all tables for two over there. You should go there."

Fiona fell silent.

Ethan wrapped his arm around her waist, pulling her closer.

"Let's go. We'll sit over there."

Fiona replied softly, "Okay."

She appeared calm.

But the man's hand on her waist was burning hot.

Her heartbeat quickened involuntarily.

Sebastian curved his lips. "Come on, let's keep eating. Where were we?"

Ryan Sullivan reminded him, "Reinforcement bar specifications."

"Right, reinforcement bars. Different manufacturers, different specs. The differences are huge…"

Sophia listened intently.

As if those two had never appeared.

The facts proved they truly didn't stir any emotion in her.

It wasn't until they finished eating and went to pay.

And saw those two again.

That Sophia remembered this whole thing.

Ethan had one arm around Fiona.

Her white scarf was draped over his other arm.

What a perfect couple.

The envy of everyone.

Ethan asked, "Do you have any band-aids?"

Fiona was wearing new high heels.

Her heels were rubbed raw.

While the front desk was getting the band-aids.

He tucked the stray hairs by her cheek behind her ear.

He asked gently, "Does it hurt?"

Fiona was stunned.

Her heart felt like it had been struck.

"N-No, it doesn't…"

Ethan chuckled. "You're still toughing it out even though it's bleeding. Don't do this next time. Tell me if it hurts."

"…Okay." Fiona looked into his deep, affectionate eyes.

How she wished this wasn't an act.

"Sir, the band-aids." The front desk staff handed them over.

Ethan took them.

He knelt down right in front of everyone.

And personally applied the band-aid to Fiona's heel.

The woman's eyelashes fluttered slightly.

Watching his considerate demeanor.

She almost drowned in this tenderness.

But the moment the man turned his back to Sophia.

She clearly saw the tenderness in his eyes vanish instantly.

Leaving only coldness.

Fiona immediately sobered up.

She clenched her hands into fists.

She didn't even feel the pain of her nails digging into her palms.

She took a deep breath, forcing herself to calm down.

"What a coincidence, running into you again. Are you finished eating too?" Fiona spoke with a smile.

Sophia replied indifferently, "Yeah."

Ryan took out cash to pay.

Ethan scanned the code to pay.

Both parties settled their bills one after the other.

They walked out of the shop one after another.

Fiona held onto Ethan's arm, her tone soft and coquettish. "Will you wait for me? I need to pop into the convenience store next door to get something."

"Do you want me to come with you?"

"No, no need. Just wait here for me."

Ethan smiled dotingly. "Okay."

Sebastian and Ryan went to the parking lot to get the car.

Sophia stood at the shop entrance waiting for them.

Then, Ethan suddenly spoke. "I didn't expect to run into you here."
###Chapter 298

Sophia Sullivan paused for a moment.

She looked up at Ethan Roscente.

"There aren't many Chinese restaurants near campus. Running into each other isn't that strange."

That "What a coincidence" from Fiona Valentine grated on her nerves.

What coincidence?

It's perfectly normal to bump into classmates while eating near school.

Their opening lines were identical.

Sophia found it utterly insincere.

Ethan watched her. "Are you angry?"

Sophia raised an eyebrow. "?"

His gaze was intense. "I remember everything you said that day. Shattered glass can't be made whole. Since you've moved on, I should too."

She looked at him.

This was the first time she had really looked at him since the breakup.

Ethan smiled. "Surprised? It's been over a year. I should have figured it out sooner. I was the one who couldn't let go. I caused you trouble. I'm sorry. It won't happen again."

Sophia studied him.

His expression was open. "Time heals all wounds. I believe that now. You were right. We need to look forward."

She frowned.

His change of heart seemed too sudden.

The words sounded sincere.

But something felt off.

It felt deliberate. Meant for her ears.

But his motives were no longer her concern.

Sophia nodded. "I'm glad you understand. I wish you the best."

Ethan's lips curved. "Thank you, Clara."

"Call me Sophia Sullivan. I wouldn't want your girlfriend to misunderstand." She offered a slight smile.

His expression didn't change, but his fingers tightened almost imperceptibly. "...Alright."

"Ethan, let's go." Fiona emerged from the convenience store, smiling as she linked her arm with his.

Ethan took her hand, his arm sliding around her waist. He nodded to Sophia. "We'll be going now."

"Mm."

Sophia looked away and sighed softly.

So exhausting.

Couldn't they just pretend they didn't see each other?

Who made the rule that exes have to make small talk? And with a new partner in tow? Ridiculous.

She hoped they wouldn't meet again.

Ryan Sullivan brought the car around and drove Sophia home.

But Sebastian Evans didn't leave.

He leaned against his car and lit a cigarette. The ember glowed at his fingertips.

Sure enough, Ethan came to get his car.

Their eyes met.

Sebastian wore a mocking half-smile. Ethan's face was blank.

After a silent battle of stares, Sebastian spoke lazily. "Where's your girlfriend? Not seeing her home?"

Ethan narrowed his eyes, then suddenly chuckled. "She lives on campus. She can walk."

"Not even to her dorm?"

Ethan countered. "How do you know I didn't?"

Sebastian checked his watch. "That fast? Shouldn't new love be hard to part from?"

"You and Isabella Langley used to make out for ages at the school gate. Changed your ways?"

Ethan's face darkened. "None of your business."

Sebastian shrugged. "Just curious. You picked this new girlfriend so conveniently. Studying at MIT. Same year and major as Sophia Sullivan. Quite the choice."

Ethan gave a cold laugh. "So interested in other people's girlfriends? Developed a habit of poaching?"

Sebastian laughed. "Don't get so defensive. Just a buddy showing concern."

Ethan's smile was sardonic. "Concern or probing? You know which."

"Oh, caught me?"

Sebastian didn't deny it. He looked Ethan over. "I think you moved on too fast. It feels like an act!"

"Think what you want. Move."

Sebastian raised an eyebrow, momentarily unable to read him.

"This show is for Sophia Sullivan, right?"

Ethan didn't argue. "Think what you want."

Sebastian's gaze sharpened. "Weren't you desperate to win Sophia back before? What happened?"

"Are you interrogating me?"

"Curious."

"I have no obligation to satisfy your curiosity."

Sebastian pressed. "What are you really trying to do?"

Ethan sneered. "Getting nervous, Sebastian Evans? You too? I can't get Sophia back, so you think you have a chance? Naive! I just woke up sooner than you. Met the right person. Save your probing."

"Really gave up? For that Fiona what's-her-name?"

Ethan's face turned icy. "You have a history. I don't want to hear my girlfriend's name from your mouth."

Sebastian saw him defending Fiona. It seemed genuine.

When he mentioned Sophia, there was no flicker. He seemed truly over it.

After a moment, Sebastian spoke flatly. "Just a joke. Don't take it seriously."

Ethan scoffed coldly. "Cut the crap. I know what you're thinking. Sorry to disappoint."

The cigarette burned out. Sebastian crushed the butt and opened his car door. "Leaving."

The engine roared, and the car sped away.

Ethan stood still, his expression cold and full of disgust.

It took immense restraint not to throw a punch at Sebastian Evans.

Trying to trick him?

Pathetic.

...

Inside the car.

Sebastian turned the steering wheel, a cold smile on his lips.

He's improved. Knows how to advance by retreating.

Put on a good act.

Almost fooled me.

But he still slipped up.

Someone truly over it doesn't parade their new partner in front of their ex to say hello.

The moment Ethan walked into that restaurant, saw Sophia, and still came over with his arm around his girlfriend, he exposed himself.

"Heh, getting clever."

The performance was decent. Too bad Sophia couldn't care less.

Whether the act was good or bad was meaningless.
###Chapter 299

The School of Bioinformatics holds a mixer for new students every year before Christmas.

All unmarried graduate students are eligible to attend.

Its purpose is to help newcomers expand their social circles.

After years of this tradition,

the event has gradually evolved into an official matchmaking session.

In plain terms, it's a setup for single men and women.

Those in relationships can also bring their partners.

But none of this concerned Sophia Sullivan.

She spent her days shuttling between MIT lectures and her Stanford lab.

Even her meals were consumed while pondering experimental data.

Where would she find time for a mixer?

So receiving the invitation came as a complete surprise.

Especially since her name was printed right on it.

That made it even stranger.

Attendance required prior registration.

She had never signed up.

How did she get a formal invitation?

A sudden realization struck Sophia.

She turned toward the lab bench.

Hannah Morse was tiptoeing away, attempting a stealthy exit.

"Stop right there!"

Hannah's back stiffened.

Two seconds later, she turned with a forced smile. "Yes, Sophia?"

"Where are you going?"

"The cafeteria."

"Didn't we just eat?"

Hannah swallowed hard. "I'm hungry again. Just grabbing a snack."

Yes, a snack!

Absolutely not fleeing the scene!

Sophia waved the invitation. "Explain this first."

Hannah avoided her gaze. "Sophia~"

Sophia crossed her arms. "Out with it."

"I meant to tell you sooner..."

"Yes?"

"I signed us both up for the mixer." Hannah blurted it out in one go. "Think of it as fun. It won't interfere with work."

Sophia was torn between laughter and exasperation. "If you wanted to go, why drag me into it?"

Hannah looked down, fidgeting. "I was too nervous to go alone."

"These things are better with more people."

She had wanted to participate in school events for a while.

But going solo felt too awkward.

So she conveniently registered Sophia as well.

Sophia sighed internally. Thanks a lot!

Hannah clung to her arm, pleading. "Come with me? I'll treat you to steak!"

Sophia shook her head. "It's not about the steak."

"Two steak dinners plus hot pot?"

Sophia gave her a look. You're the one who wants to eat, aren't you?

"You're the best, Sophia! Please come with me~"

"Fine. Just this once."

Hannah nodded eagerly. "Next time, I'll ask first!"

...

The mixer was scheduled for Friday evening.

Rumors said even some administrators would attend.

It was, after all, an official function.

The venue was booked at the sports center.

Decorations began two days in advance.

Balloons, flowers, a red carpet, long tables, desserts, and drinks—everything was provided.

By the time Sophia and Hannah arrived, many had already gathered.

Hannah looked around excitedly.

Even the usually disheveled boys had cleaned up nicely.

This trip was definitely worth it.

Sophia was MIT's campus belle.

Though she never acknowledged it.

And she rarely attended such events.

But that didn't stop people from noticing her.

Today, she arrived without makeup.

Dressed in a simple down jacket.

Yet she still turned heads.

"Hello, I'm Easton Shaw from the Biology Department. May I have the honor of the opening dance with you?"
###Chapter 300

Sophia Sullivan shook her head gently.

She politely declined the dance invitation.

The young man left, disappointed.

No sooner had one left than another approached.

After turning down five in a row, Sophia pulled Hannah Morse toward a secluded corner.

The lighting was dim here.

The spot was hidden.

She could finally catch her breath.

"Sophia, you're so popular. Even I want to ask you for a dance."

"For you, I might consider it."

Hannah immediately puffed out her chest. "Those guys must be so jealous of me!"

"Is that a bad thing?"

"Of course not~"

They shared a smile.

Hannah stood up. "I'm going to get some pastries!"

"Okay."

Sophia unscrewed her water bottle and took a few sips.

She had zero interest in socializing. She pulled out her tablet and began reviewing a research paper.

Hannah returned with a plate of snacks and froze at the sight.

This scene made her feel utterly inadequate.

This table had remained empty.

It was perfect.

But trouble always finds you.

"Is this seat taken? May I sit here?"

"Sorry, we—" Hannah began to refuse.

Sophia looked up and started.

"Professor? What are you doing here?"

Alexander Laurent wore a grey suit, his black overcoat draped over his arm.

He gave a slight nod. "May I sit?"

Sophia smiled and nodded. "Of course."

It took Hannah a few seconds to process. "Hello, Professor! Are you here for the mixer too?"

"Yes," Alexander replied flatly.

But this was clearly a freshman mixer.

The mystery was soon solved.

The host announced it was time for the Spotlight Roulette.

A beam of light swept across the room.

"Three, two, one!"

A white light suddenly shot into their corner.

All three instinctively squinted.

The light landed squarely on Alexander.

He rose calmly and accepted the microphone.

The host grinned. "It's Professor Laurent! Would you like to say a few words to kick off the mixer?"

It was clearly pre-arranged.

Alexander offered a few polite remarks and sat back down.

The spotlight moved away.

"That's it?" Sophia whispered.

"What else?" He chuckled softly. "Should I have given an academic report?"

"You could try," she teased.

"I'd put everyone to sleep."

"So you came specifically for the opening remarks?"

"Work obligation," he said, his tone neutral.

Sophia muttered, "I didn't think you attended events like this…"

Alexander never did.

Invitations in previous years were always declined.

Except this year.

He accepted immediately.

Quincy Evans was stunned. "Alex, are you feeling alright?"

Alexander didn't look up.

Quincy pointed at the invitation. "This is a social mixer! Not an academic conference!"

"I know."

"And you're still going?"

"Is there a problem?"

"This is unbelievable…"

Quincy suddenly noticed the school name.

"School of Life Sciences? That's Sophia's school, right?"

Alexander's movements paused almost imperceptibly.

Quincy leaned in for a closer look. "Alex, you've got it bad!"

"Do you like that girl?"

"Does she know?"

"You're so much older than her. Would she even accept that?"

The rapid-fire questions left Alexander silent.

…

"Professor?" Sophia's voice was soft.

Alexander snapped back to the present. "What?"

"Are you heading home or back to the lab after this?"

"Home."

Sophia nodded. "Then we can—"

Before she could finish, a figure stopped beside them.

She looked up.

Sebastian Evans smiled slightly. "What a coincidence. Is this seat taken?"

He turned to Hannah. "Would you mind moving over?"

Hannah nodded, flustered. "O-okay."

She shuffled sideways.

Sebastian thanked her and sat down, close to Sophia.

Sophia was surprised. "What are you doing here?"

Sebastian glanced at Alexander. "Professor Laurent is here too."

"He gave the opening remarks. What about you?"

Sebastian shrugged. "I'm here as a sponsor."

University events often sought investments from alumni.

This particular CEO alumnus was a prime target.

Sophia raised an eyebrow. "Do you personally attend every event you sponsor, Mr. Evans?"

That sounded exhausting.

"Of course not," he said bluntly. "I came for you."

Sophia was speechless.

Alexander's gaze darkened.

Sebastian wore a faint, challenging smile.

Hannah intervened quickly. "I'm going for more food. Sophia, come with me?"

"Yes!" Sophia stood up immediately.

They hurried away.

Sebastian offered a water bottle. "Water, Professor?"

Alexander took it. "Thank you."

"I didn't expect to see you at a mixer, Professor."

Alexander looked up. "You're here too, Mr. Evans."

"I came for Sophia. And you?"

"Likewise."

Sebastian's eyes turned cold. "What do you mean, Professor?"

"Exactly what you think I mean."

Sebastian's expression was blank. "What? Has the Professor developed feelings too?"

"I am only human."

"Quite frank, Professor. But some thoughts are best kept in check."

Alexander gave a light laugh. "I could say the same to you, Mr. Evans."

Sebastian fell silent.

The music started again.

The spotlight swept over the crowd.

The host's voice boomed. "Who will be the next lucky one? Get ready for the light—"
###Chapter 301

The spotlight focused on the central round table.

Its beam enveloped a man and a woman.

The host exclaimed, "Wow! Our lucky audience members! Care to introduce yourselves?"

Fiona Valentine took the microphone and stood. "Bioinformatics major, Fiona Valentine."

The host turned. "And the handsome gentleman beside you?"

Ethan Roscente remained expressionless.

Fiona chuckled lightly. "My boyfriend, Ethan Roscente. He's from another school, came here just to be with me."

"Whoa—" The room instantly erupted in cheers.

A couple at a singles mixer was practically public displays of affection.

"You're a legend, man!"

"Goddess Fiona is top-tier in our department. So many guys have their eyes on her, and you actually won her over."

"Such a prize, and she went to an outsider..."

Fiona was exceptionally beautiful with a gentle personality, always popular.

Ethan remained aloof.

The surrounding chatter was just background noise to him.

His gaze had long drifted to a corner.

He had watched Sophia Sullivan enter, reject advances, and witnessed the arrivals of Alexander Laurent and Sebastian Evans.

He saw her every move.

Including now—

She and Hannah Morse returned to their seats with desserts, completely oblivious to the commotion.

She probably hadn't even noticed him.

Of course, Sophia heard.

Fiona's declaration, "My boyfriend, Ethan Roscente," came through clearly.

But it stirred nothing within her.

Like a wind passing over stagnant water, leaving no ripples.

Hannah said, "The tiramisu is better than the macarons. What do you think, Sophia?"

"Didn't try the macarons. The tiramisu is okay, a bit heavy on the rum."

"Oh! Your palate is so sharp, Sophia! Try this shortbread cookie. My favorite today."

Sophia took a bite. "Definitely the best."

"Let me try—" Sebastian Evans casually snatched the remaining half and popped it into his mouth.

He chewed and nodded. "So sweet~"

Sophia was speechless.

Hannah: [Shudder] JPG

So cringe it gave me goosebumps, dude!

Alexander Laurent shot him a cold glare.

The spotlight then landed on Sebastian.

He swallowed the cookie, stood up calmly, and took the microphone. "No introduction needed. I'm not from the School of Life Sciences."

"How did you get in then?" the host asked curiously.

Sebastian replied, "Sponsor."

Whoosh—

"The benefactor!"

"A sponsor this young and handsome? Shatters all illusions..."

The host's eyes sparkled. "May I ask a question on behalf of all the single women here?"

Sebastian gestured for her to proceed.

"Are you... single?"

Sebastian answered, "Currently, yes."

"Does that mean there's a chance for anyone?" the host pressed boldly.

"No."

"Why not?"

Sebastian said, "There's someone I like."

His smiling gaze fell on Sophia Sullivan.

Alexander Laurent's expression was stony. The water bottle in his hand subtly deformed.

Hannah glanced at the preening Sebastian, then at the indifferent Sophia, and decided to focus on eating.

Mmm, so good~

Sebastian ignored the sighs from the crowd and returned the microphone before sitting down.

Out of the corner of his eye, Sophia was still eating, her cheeks puffed out like a squirrel.

He surprised himself with how fixated he was on this one woman.

He'd had his share of relationships, but no one had ever captivated him like this, fascinated him, even...

Consumed him.

He couldn't get enough of looking at her. At one point, he even thought he could watch her forever.

Alexander Laurent spoke abruptly, "You're in high spirits tonight, Mr. Evans."

"Professor Laurent isn't doing so badly either."

Their eyes met,杀气弥漫ing the air between them.

"Ahem!" Hannah couldn't take it anymore. "Sophia, come to the restroom with me?"

"Okay." She was more than willing.

The moment they stepped away from the table, she let out a long sigh of relief.

Hannah giggled softly. "Feeling better now?"

"Thanks. You saved me."

"Hehe~ Don't mention it!"

Away from the battlefield, let the roosters peck at each other.

...

The spotlight segment ended, transitioning into an open dance session.

Music swelled, lights swirled.

The host announced, "Gentlemen, the floor is yours. Invite your desired dance partners!"

With a bow, he exited the stage.

Thunderous applause followed.

Fiona introduced Ethan to some familiar classmates.

She wore an expensive tweed suit.

Ethan had bought it for her without batting an eye.

He'd even特意 chosen a matching necktie.

To outsiders, they looked like the perfect fairy-tale couple.

But Fiona knew the truth.

Ethan's body was here, but his mind was long gone.

It had flown to Sophia Sullivan!

He tried hard to act indifferent, but his peripheral vision was locked on that corner.

He was also wary of being noticed by Sophia and Sebastian.

Fiona saw it all clearly.

Her heart felt pierced. It took her a moment to compose herself before she turned to him with a smile. "Well, boyfriend, aren't you going to ask me for a dance?"

Ethan frowned. "Is that necessary?"

Fiona looked directly at him. "Don't you want to see how Sophia reacts when she sees you holding someone else while you dance?"
###Chapter 302

Ethan Roscente’s brow arched slightly.

He extended his hand toward her.

Bending at the waist in an inviting gesture.

Fiona Valentine smiled and placed her hand in his palm.

Together, they glided onto the dance floor.

Sophia Sullivan and Hannah Morse returned from the restroom just in time to see this.

A handsome man and a beautiful woman made a perfect pair.

It was nice.

She calmly averted her gaze.

Suddenly—

Two hands extended toward her at once.

One on the left.

One on the right.

Sebastian Evans and Alexander Laurent were both inviting her.

Hannah Morse took two frightened steps back.

This…

A major showdown?

Sebastian Evans smiled. "Sophia, would you honor me with a dance?"

Alexander Laurent's lips curved. "What a coincidence. I was just about to ask the same."

Sebastian Evans turned to look at him.

Alexander Laurent met his gaze calmly.

The air crackled with tension.

Sophia Sullivan was completely stunned.

What was happening? Did these two plan this?

She instinctively looked at Hannah Morse.

Hannah Morse shook her head with a pained expression: Sis, I really can't help you this time.

The commotion in the corner initially went unnoticed.

But the onlookers had a keen sense for drama.

They quickly gathered around.

"Wow—Professor Laurent and Mr. Evans?!"

"Who are they inviting? Sophia Sullivan? That explains it."

Beautiful, academically top-tier, published in 'Science' as a first-year grad student.

The acknowledged campus belle.

"Tsk tsk... This is intense!"

"Not even a TV drama would dare plot this!"

A love triangle never goes out of style.

All three protagonists were figures of gossip.

The onlookers expressed: Love this, give us more!

Not far away, Ethan Roscente saw this scene, his hand abruptly tightening.

"Ouch—"

Fiona Valentine gasped in pain.

"Apologies." He released her and strode directly off the dance floor.

Leaving Fiona Valentine standing alone.

Sophia Sullivan's scalp prickled.

She looked at Sebastian Evans. The expectation in the man's eyes made her afraid to look deeper.

Then she met Alexander Laurent's gaze.

His pupils were deep as the ocean, tenderness hidden within, a superficial smile on the surface.

Sophia's heart skipped a beat, and she hurriedly looked away.

"Sorry, I just remembered some experimental data I need to process. I have to go."

She turned and walked away quickly.

Sebastian Evans watched her fleeing figure, his eyes darkening.

But then he reconsidered. She hadn't accepted Alexander Laurent either.

"Tsk, disappointed, Professor Laurent?"

Alexander Laurent calmly withdrew his hand.

"Disappointed by something so trivial? What would I do then in the future?"

Sebastian Evans frowned. "...The future?"

"Yes," he said, a slight smile touching his lips. "There will be time."

With that, he turned and left.

"Neither succeeded? Interesting!"

"Is Sophia Sullivan that aloof?"

"If I had a 'Science' publication, I'd be aloof too!"

The crowd gradually dispersed.

No drama to watch, the spectators naturally drifted away.

But two people remained.

Simon Lowell called Lillian Lopez's name twice.

She didn't respond.

He reached out and placed a hand on her shoulder.

Lillian Lopez finally snapped out of it.

"...What did you say just now?"

"I asked what you were looking at."

"Nothing." Lillian brushed his hand away. "I need to speak with Professor Laurent."

She immediately hurried after Alexander Laurent.

Simon Lowell looked at his now empty hand, then at her retreating, eager figure, a puzzled frown forming.

He hadn't expected Lillian Lopez to be interested in the mixer.

Since she wanted to attend, he accompanied her.

He'd specifically contacted the graduate student union to attend in his capacity as a faculty advisor.

Lillian Lopez had smiled brightly when she saw the invitation.

Simon Lowell rarely saw her smile like that. He felt it was worth it.

"Professor, wait a moment—"

Alexander Laurent paused, turning to see Lillian Lopez approaching with a smile.

"Lillian, is something the matter?"

"Professor," she said half-jokingly, "Since Sophia is busy, perhaps I could have this dance with you instead?"

Alexander Laurent's eyes darkened. "That won't be necessary."

Lillian Lopez's smile stiffened, then she forced a light tone. "Just a joke... I actually came to ask about that aging equipment in the lab. When will it be replaced? Professor Quincy has complained several times."

Alexander Laurent frowned. "I sent a group email two days ago. It detailed the resolution plan and the installation schedule for the new equipment."

Lillian Lopez's expression froze. "R-really? I must have missed it... My apologies."

"Lab regulation number two requires daily clearing of the work email inbox."

"Professor, I—"

"As a researcher, I hope you will focus more of your energy on your research."

Lillian Lopez lowered her head. "Understood."

"Hmm."

He turned and left.

Lillian Lopez had been thoroughly rebuffed and lectured. She gritted her teeth in anger.

Simon Lowell walked over and handed her a glass of juice, his tone gentle. "Lillian, your favorite lime soda."

Lillian Lopez looked up sharply.

For a moment, Simon Lowell thought he saw... disgust in her eyes?

She was disgusted by him?

When he looked more closely, there was nothing in those beautiful eyes.

"Thank you," Lillian Lopez said, taking a sip. "It's quite good."

But her hand holding the glass tightened until her knuckles turned white.

Why?

Why did Alexander Laurent actively invite Sophia Sullivan, yet dismiss her so completely?

Sophia Sullivan had rejected him!

Why were so many men orbiting around Sophia Sullivan?

What was so great about her!

"Who is more beautiful, me or Sophia Sullivan?" Lillian Lopez asked suddenly.

Simon Lowell was taken aback.

It took him a few seconds to process the question before he answered with a smile. "You and Sophia are both beautiful, but in my heart, you are the most beautiful, Lillian. No arguments!"

Such sweet talk didn't please Lillian Lopez. Instead, her expression darkened further.

Yes, she was this beautiful. So why couldn't Alexander Laurent see it?
###Chapter 303

After Alexander Laurent left, Lillian Lopez also lost interest.

"I'm going back."

She abandoned Simon Lowell and turned to leave.

Simon stood frozen in place.

He wanted to chase after her for an explanation, and to see her home.

But he remembered his duties as the faculty representative.

He couldn't leave early.

She could come and go as she pleased, but he had to stay.

Simon sighed helplessly.

Even though they were a couple, he always felt Lillian was distant and elusive.

So distant that he had never truly understood her thoughts.

Since they started dating, aside from holding hands, they hadn't even kissed.

He lowered his head dejectedly.

Suddenly, someone bumped into him.

"Sorry! Did I hurt you?" Hannah Morse was holding a plate piled with pastries in one hand and a drink in the other. The collision had spilled some of her drink.

She apologized frantically.

Simon waved it off. "It's fine."

He pulled out a tissue and handed it to her. "Here."

"Thank you!" Hannah moved to take it but realized both her hands were full. She flushed with embarrassment.

Simon noticed her dilemma. "Should I hold the plate for you?"

"Would you mind?"

"Not at all." He took the plate from her.

Hannah wiped her hands. "It's all my fault for being so clumsy…"

"Don't worry about it. I was lost in thought and not watching where I was going."

"Let me give you a pastry to make up for it."

Simon finally noticed the four or five types of desserts on the plate: mango mousse, durian mille-feuille, Napoleon…

"Sounds good." He smiled and took the durian mille-feuille.

A flicker of reluctance passed through Hannah's eyes.

"What's wrong?" Simon found this girl quite amusing.

Her expressions were rich and genuine, her thoughts completely written on her face.

Hannah shook her head. "Nothing. This one is really delicious."

"You've tried it?"

"Yeah! Three pieces."

"…"

"Your expression just now didn't look like 'nothing.' Were you reluctant to give it to me?"

Hannah gave an awkward laugh. "No, no. I just… can you actually eat durian? A lot of people don't like it. I thought you wouldn't choose that one…"

That way, the last piece would still be hers!

Simon laughed. "I like it!"

But it had been a long time since he'd had any, because Lillian hated the smell.

Last time, Zoe Langley gave him a small piece. "Secretly, don't tell Lillian."

Simon thought since Lillian wasn't in the lab today, the smell would be gone by tomorrow, so he took a bite.

But she still found out the next day.

She ignored him for three days.

After that, Simon never touched durian products again.

But today…

He suddenly didn't want to restrain himself anymore.

Simon said, "I'll take this one! Thanks!"

He was about to leave when suddenly—

"Is that the hidden food toy charm from Kim's?!" Hannah was about to leave when she caught a glimpse of the charm on Simon's phone. It was the "Sweet Dumpling" one she had been trying to collect for ages!

She was instantly thrilled.

She had a bit of a compulsive streak and had to complete the entire set when opening blind boxes.

This food toy charm set only needed the "Sweet Dumpling" to be complete.

Sweet Dumpling was the hidden variant, with an extremely low pull rate.

That dessert shop only sold the blind boxes during special events. Her luck had always been terrible; she hadn't pulled the hidden variant in over a year or two. Seeing Simon's charm now, she couldn't hold back her excitement.

Simon was somewhat surprised. "You go to that shop often too?"

"Yeah! Their cakes are pretty good."

Simon usually didn't bother much with these small ornaments.

On one hand, Lillian looked down on them. On the other, he felt a man in his thirties hanging these things seemed immature.

But this charm had been on his phone since he bought it. It wasn't very noticeable, so he was surprised this girl had such sharp eyes.

"How many times did you pull?" Hannah asked.

"About three times?"

Hannah gritted her teeth in frustration.

Why was everyone else so lucky, while she had such terrible luck?

Simon couldn't help but laugh at her gnashing teeth. "How about you leave me your address? I have another hidden variant at home. I can give it to you."

Hannah's head snapped up, meeting his gentle, smiling eyes. He reminded her so much of the big brother from next door who used to play with her when she was little!

Simon was 178 cm tall, with regular features and a gentle, scholarly demeanor. When he smiled, his eyes seemed to light up.

Soft, without any hint of aggression.

As tolerant as water.

Hannah stared at him blankly, her cheeks suddenly feeling hot, the warmth spreading to the tips of her ears.

Her speech became stammered.

"You… you re… really want to give it to me?"

Simon was puzzled. She was fine just a moment ago; why was she stuttering now?

He found this girl quite cute and was about to speak when someone called out to him:

"Dr. Lowell— the event is almost over. We need you to verify and sign off!"

"Okay, coming right away."

He suddenly remembered something, turned back, and handed her a business card. "My phone number is on here. Remember to send me your address."

Hannah held the business card, watching him leave until his figure disappeared before she finally looked away.

She lowered her gaze to look at it—

Simon Lowell?

…

Sophia Sullivan had already left, and Sebastian Evans had no interest in socializing.

An event like this normally couldn't attract him. He had only come for her.

But before leaving, he still went to say goodbye to the dean, and smeared the reputation.

The dean, wise with age, smiled and agreed—

"Don't worry, I'll handle it."

"Good."

After Sebastian went outside, his nicotine craving hit. He reached into his pocket for his lighter but suddenly paused.

Ethan Roscente stood not far away, leaning against his car, smoking.

He looked over coldly—

"What? Want one? I thought you quit ages ago?"

Sebastian curved his lips. "Yeah, I quit. But not completely."

Ethan: "Want a cigarette?"

Sebastian shoved his hands in his pockets and walked towards his own car, parking right next to Ethan's.

He didn't take the cigarette. Instead, he pulled out a pack of gum from his car and started chewing. "No need. I have this."

Ethan scoffed lightly. "Poser!"

Sebastian: "Why are you out here? Weren't you dancing with your girlfriend?"

Ethan: "Finished. It's stuffy inside. Came out for a smoke."

He pulled out his lighter and lit up.

The smell of nicotine carried by the wind filled Sebastian's nostrils. The familiar scent made his fingers itch, but his expression remained unchanged.

Ethan held back again and again but finally couldn't resist sneering: "Things seemed pretty lively over on your side earlier. So? How does it feel to be rejected?"
###Chapter 304

Sebastian Evans crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow.

"Nice moves on the dance floor. Still have energy to worry about us?"

Ethan Roscente's face was expressionless.

"The commotion was hard to ignore."

Sebastian shrugged indifferently.

"Just a rejection. Not my first. You know Sophia's temper better than I do."

Half of Ethan's face was hidden in shadow.

"I told you, you never had a chance."

Sebastian's lips curved into a smirk.

"The harder the challenge, the more I want it. One failure just means I try again. I'll succeed eventually."

Ethan let out a cold laugh.

"Be careful you don't fall to your death before you reach the top."

"At least it would be a thrilling death. You know what's truly pathetic?"

Ethan narrowed his eyes.

Sebastian gave a light laugh.

"What's pathetic is someone who never even gets rejected, just pretends to be above it all. Too bad, no matter how convincing the act, no one actually cares."

He pulled open the car door.

Before leaving, he rolled down the window.

"Remember to walk your girlfriend back to her dorm. Kiss her a few more times for good measure. Sell the act. Be professional, alright?"

The car's taillights disappeared into the night.

Ethan clenched his fist.

Fiona Valentine found him.

"Why did you come out? Aren't you cold?"

"Needed some air."

"It's over. Thank you for accompanying me…"

"Yeah. Let's go."

"Where to?"

"Your dorm."

Ethan turned and walked away.

Fiona was stunned for a moment, then quickly caught up.

"Wait for me…"

That night, three men lay awake.

Sophia Sullivan had left early, heading straight to the lab.

She finished processing two sets of data before going home.

She took a shower and got into bed.

She played on her phone and read the news.

Then she turned off the light and went to sleep.

She slept soundly through the night.

…

Early class the next day.

The alarm hadn't gone off, but Sophia woke up naturally.

She washed up and got dressed.

The fridge was empty, so she went to the cafeteria for breakfast.

She ran into Hannah Morse.

"Morning, Sophia!"

"Morning~"

At the counter, Sophia placed her order.

"One mini steamed roll, corn, and soy milk."

Hannah pointed next to her.

"I'll have the same!"

Sophia was surprised.

"Stomach upset?"

"No…"

"You usually have five buns and two shaomai. Why so little today?"

Hannah fell silent.

Some truths are better left unspoken!

"Not very hungry… Let's go, Sophia, we'll be late."

"Okay."

In the classroom, they sat down to eat.

Sophia glanced at Hannah's tray.

That amount wouldn't even be a snack for her.

She'd be hungry within two hours.

After two classes.

Hannah sat perfectly still.

There was no sign of her getting a snack.

Sophia was amazed.

Really not hungry?

Hannah was screaming internally.

Starving! Potato chips, cookies, cake, spicy strips, chicken feet…

Must resist!

Sophia was completely unaware.

The next morning, Hannah again ate very little.

Sophia suddenly realized—

"Hannah, are you on a diet?"

"Yeah! Sophia, how come you eat so much and never get hungry, but I'm starving in half an hour?"

It's just not fair.

"Why the sudden diet?"

This wasn't like Hannah.

The Hannah she knew never had body image issues.

Sophia's gaze deepened.

"Are you seeing someone?"

Marcus Lawrence in the front row suddenly turned around.

His dark eyes were intense.

"With who?"

Hannah waved her hands frantically.

"No, no!"

"Do you have a crush on someone?"

Her tone was less certain this time.

Marcus frowned deeply.

"Don't let anyone fool you."

"No one would!"

Sophia advised gently.

"You can't diet like this. You need to cut back gradually, or you'll ruin your health."

Hannah patted her stomach.

"I think I'm getting used to it now…"

As she said this, she stared fixedly at Sophia's small cake.

…

Elsewhere, Hannah's father was worried.

His only daughter, raised in privilege.

She got whatever she wanted.

Her allowance was always generous.

So what if she was plump? It meant good fortune!

Anyone who said otherwise was just jealous!

But since last week, something was off…

His daughter's living expenses dropped from five figures to four.

He called to ask, and she said she was dieting.

Henry Morse spat out his tea.

He stood up abruptly.

"What? You're on a diet?"
###Chapter 305

Henry Lorenz paced in place, his brow furrowed.

"You always laughed it off when people called you chubby before. Why the sudden decision to lose weight? Is someone bullying you?"

Hannah Morse had been doted on since childhood, growing up confident and sunny, never insecure about her figure.

Even in elementary school when she was isolated for being overweight, she remained cheerful all day. Now she suddenly wanted to diet?

His daughter was simple-minded and carefree. For her to make such a resolution... how much pain must she have endured?

Henry's heart tightened.

Afraid he would spiral into worse assumptions, Hannah quickly explained, "An educational video said moderate weight loss is good for health. I can't stay overweight forever, so I just wanted to try..."

Henry's frown deepened.

An educational video?

Something was definitely wrong!

His daughter loved eating and drinking most, followed by tinkering with bottles and jars in the lab.

Short video platforms and live streams had been booming for years, yet she never cared for them.

She would never decide to diet because of one video.

Suddenly, inspiration struck him. "Are you dating someone?"

Hannah's face instantly flushed. Thankfully it was just a phone call. "N-no! I'm here to study! Oh, Dad, class is about to start. Bye!"

She hung up immediately.

Henry: "?"

Such a big reaction, and she says there's nothing?!

Hmph! His daughter was still young. Any man daring to make a move on her would have his legs broken!

Hannah bought breakfast and rushed into the classroom.

It was Alexander Laurent's class today.

Sophia Sullivan and Marcus Lawrence were already seated. Class started in ten minutes.

"Eating so little again?" Sophia looked at her breakfast, concerned.

Marcus frowned deeply, enough to crush a mosquito.

He had been like this for two days. No one knew who had upset him.

In that short time, Hannah finished a corn cob and stared longingly at a siu mai.

If she ate it, it would be gone.

Marcus said coldly, "Is it worth it?"

"Of course it's worth it! I've lost five pounds. Five pounds!"

Converted to pork, that was enough for ten plates of shredded pork stir-fry!

Marcus: "You brought this on yourself."

He ignored her after that, flipping his textbook pages loudly.

Hannah: "?" She was the one dieting. Why was he so worked up?

"Huh? What's this? Hannah, did you drop this?" Sophia picked up a business card from under the seat.

Hannah looked at it and was about to speak when Sophia exclaimed, "Huh? Why is Dr. Simon Lowell's business card here?"

"Sophia, you know him?"

"Yes. He's a member of Professor Laurent's team. Works at MIT. I think he's a counselor."

Hannah's eyes lit up. "What's he like?"

"Good personality, polite, strong academically. He got here entirely on his own merit."

"Is he married?" Hannah felt she needed to clarify.

She had wanted to ask around but never got the chance or found a reliable source.

Sophia shook her head. "Not that I know of."

Hannah just started to relax—

"But he has a girlfriend."

He has a girlfriend...

Hannah fell silent for a moment.

"Why do you ask?" Sophia already had a guess.

"...I accidentally bumped into him at the mixer last time. He wasn't angry and even helped me get a plate. I thought he was nice, so I wanted to know more!"

The class bell rang.

Alexander Laurent entered the classroom. "Today we'll cover molecular evolution and phylogenetics..."

During the ten-minute break, Hannah listlessly slumped over the desk.

Marcus couldn't take it anymore. "You've been acting very strange these past few days!"

Hannah: "?" Was he talking to her?

"You!"

Unexpectedly, Hannah wasn't angry. She nodded in agreement. "I think so too!"

Marcus was stunned.

"Look how hungry I've gotten. I've never suffered like this since I was little... Dieting is too hard. So I've decided—"

"?"

"I'm not doing it anymore! I refuse to diet, even if you kill me!"

Marcus: "..." That wasn't what you said a moment ago.

"How about I treat you and Sophia to a meal after class?"

Before Marcus or Sophia could respond.

Hannah made the decision on the spot. "Okay, it's settled!"

Marcus: "?"

Sophia: "..."

"Steak or hot pot? Sichuan or Cantonese? Seafood buffet? Burgers, fries, fried chicken, and Coke? How about we get some of everything? That sounds perfect!"

Hannah waited hungrily until the bell finally rang: Ready, set—

Alexander Laurent stood at the podium. "That's all for today. Class dismissed."

The moment he finished speaking, Hannah grabbed Sophia and Marcus and bolted out of the classroom, moving so fast they were a blur.

Alexander's words, "Sophia, stay for a moment," caught in his throat before he could say them. They were already gone.

"..."

After her hearty meal, Hannah leaned back in her chair, every pore content.

She had an epiphany—

What diet? Did she, the young lady, need to bother with that herself?

Whoever wanted to diet could do it. She wasn't going to suffer anymore!

Even if she met a guy she liked in the future, she wouldn't starve herself.

As for Dr. Simon Lowell...

The moment she learned he had a girlfriend, Hannah stopped thinking about him.

What decent girl would set her sights on someone else's boyfriend?

There were no classes in the afternoon. After eating, they each went home.

As Sophia reached the alley entrance, she saw Alexander walking ahead.

She smiled and ran to catch up, reaching out to poke his shoulder.

Alexander turned around but didn't see anyone. Sophia deliberately hid on the other side.

He turned the other way but still saw no one.

Sophia had already switched sides and stood next to him, grinning like a child who had successfully pulled a prank.

Alexander chuckled. "Lucky it's me. Anyone else would have been scared."

"I wouldn't dare tease anyone else," Sophia blurted out.

"Why do you dare tease me?" The man's gaze deepened.

Uh!

She paused for a moment, then said seriously, "First, we're familiar, so I'm not afraid to tease you. 
###Chapter 306

Second, Professor, you have strong nerves. You can take a joke."

"Where did you get the idea that I can take a joke?" Alexander was both amused and exasperated.

"Just now." She stated matter-of-factly.

They walked upstairs together. Alexander asked her, "Are you getting used to Professor Feng's lab?"

"Mmhmm! Professor Feng is nice, and the equipment is new."

"Everything's settled in?"

Sophia was about to answer when a dog bark suddenly came from upstairs.

Before either could react, a Husky charged straight down.

Sophia only saw a black and white blur rushing at her. Terrified, she shut her eyes and desperately needed to get her feet off the ground.

Driven by instinct, she leaped violently.

Dog fur brushed past her calf as the Husky continued charging downstairs.

She breathed a long sigh of relief, and then...

Embarrassingly realized she had jumped onto Alexander Laurent!
She wrapped her arms around the man's neck, clinging to him.

Sophia Sullivan was like a startled koala.

Alexander Laurent was the steady tree.

"I'm sorry... a dog suddenly ran out..." Her voice trembled as she tried to get down.

But the man's hand remained firmly on her waist.

Even through her heavy coat, she could feel the warmth of his palm.

Sophia's cheeks flushed rapidly.

The blush spread all the way to the tips of her ears.

"Professor..." she called softly.

Alexander didn't let go.

"Scared?" His voice was low.

It was unclear if he meant the dog, or himself.

Sophia nodded gently.

"You jumped on me yourself," he stated the fact.

Her ears burned hotter. "I was too frightened..."

The moment the dog charged out, there was nowhere to hide in the stairwell.

Her instinct was to throw herself at him.

Now she was embarrassed, but not regretful.

"Can you put me down?" she whispered.

Her warm breath brushed past his ear.

Alexander's body stiffened slightly. He stepped back a little, but his hand still rested on her waist.

"...Sure?" His voice was even huskier.

Sophia looked down.

One sneaker was being carried away by the dog.

Her beige cotton sock was exposed to the air.

The stairwell floor was covered in dust.

She instinctively tightened her arms around his neck.

"Do you still want to get down now?"

She fell silent.

Alexander stopped teasing her.

He simply scooped her up into his arms and carried her steadily upstairs.

Sophia curled against his chest.

Looking up, she could see his clean jawline.

His breathing was even. His steps were sure.

The scent of sandalwood lingered around her.

"...We're here."

She snapped back to reality.

"Keys," he reminded.

Sophia flusteredly dug her keys out of her bag.

After opening the door, he gently set her down on the entryway floor.

Her cotton sock was still pristine white.

Alexander turned to leave.

Sophia changed into slippers, her heart still racing.

She poured a glass of hot water.

The warmth in her palm couldn't compare to his touch earlier.

A sudden knock sounded at the door.

Alexander stood outside, holding her shoe.

"Thank you, Professor."

"Don't mention it."

...

That afternoon, Sophia arrived at the lab on time.

Marcus Lawrence was already busy.

Hannah Morse walked in carrying bubble tea.

A dedicated break area was set up in one corner.

Marcus naturally took the drink Hannah offered.

Sophia was a little surprised.

He never used to drink these voluntarily.

Hannah smiled, her eyes curving. "Is the new flavor good?"

"...Yeah."

"Try mine next time."

"...Okay."

Sophia turned to look out the window.

The sky was growing dark.

The three of them worked until evening.

Hannah and Marcus left first.

Sophia stayed behind to finish up.

At exactly seven, she locked the lab door.

The wind was bitterly cold.

She buried her face in her scarf and shoved her hands into her pockets.

She looked like a round little penguin.

"Sophia—"

A familiar voice called from behind.

She turned, a flicker of surprise in her eyes. "Professor?"

"Here to take care of something," he said, his gaze direct.

The morning's scene flashed through her mind.

Sophia's ears grew warm.

"Have you eaten dinner?" he asked.

She shook her head.

"Together?"

Her phone suddenly rang.

Sebastian Evans's voice came through. "Where are you?"

"Just left the lab."

"Don't forget the weekly meeting tonight," he reminded.

Sophia finally remembered the prior arrangement.

She looked apologetically at Alexander.

"Is that Mr. Evans?" Alexander smiled.

She nodded.

There was a brief silence on the other end of the line.

Sebastian's tone was light. "Since you ran into each other, why not join us for dinner? We can have our meeting. He can do his own thing."

He added the last part deliberately.

Alexander responded calmly. "Sure. I don't want to intrude."

Sebastian: "..."

Sometimes he really felt like slapping himself.
###Chapter 307

The small restaurant outside the school gates was still bustling.

Sophia Sullivan and Alexander Laurent pushed the door open and entered.

Sebastian Evans was already waiting by the window.

"Sophia..." He stood up to greet her, his gaze intensely fixed on her face.

He completely ignored Alexander standing beside her.

Sophia gave a slight nod. "Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Evans."

The address "Mr. Evans" made the corner of Alexander's lips curve upward.

Sebastian seemed to notice him only then. "Professor Laurent. We meet again."

Alexander maintained his smile. "It seems fate keeps bringing us together."

Sebastian gestured with his hand. "Please, have a seat."

He guided Alexander to the seat next to his own, then pulled out the chair opposite for Sophia.

With this arrangement, the seating order became—

Alexander Laurent, Sebastian Evans, Sophia Sullivan.

"That spot faces the door directly. There's a draft. Sophia, you'll be warmer sitting here by me."

Alexander pulled out the chair next to his own.

Sophia readily agreed and smoothly took the seat.

The seating order instantly changed to—

Sophia Sullivan, Alexander Laurent, Sebastian Evans.

"Still cold?" Alexander asked gently, ignoring Sebastian's suddenly darkening expression.

"Much better." Sophia nodded.

Sebastian narrowed his eyes. "There is a draft over here. I'll move as well."

The final seating order was set—

Sebastian Evans, Sophia Sullivan, Alexander Laurent.

The Professor: "..."

Sebastian smiled at the girl. "I've already ordered. All your favorites."

Sophia thanked him, then suddenly remembered Alexander. "Professor, would you like to look at the menu? See if there's anything you'd like to add?"

Alexander shook his head. "No need. I'm easy."

"Please don't stand on ceremony. Order anything you'd like."

"Alright."

A sour feeling churned in Sebastian's chest.

Why didn't she ask him?

He completely forgot he was the one who had ordered all the food in the first place.

Naturally, Sophia assumed Sebastian would have considered everyone's tastes.

The dishes arrived one after another.

Even Alexander noticed Sebastian's gloomy expression.

Sophia, however, remained completely oblivious, focused solely on serving food to Alexander.

"Thank you. You should eat more yourself."

"Alright."

Watching their interaction, Sebastian's jaw tightened. His expression grew colder.

When had Sophia ever been this attentive to him?

What was so special about Alexander Laurent?

"Mr. Evans, why aren't you eating?" Sophia finally noticed him.

Sebastian's tone was flat. "Not hungry."

Sophia turned the steamed pork ribs plate to face him. "You like these. Try some."

The man's eyes lit up. "You remember I like these?"

"Of course."

Sebastian's heart leaped with sudden joy.

The next second—

Sophia: "Charlie likes crystal shrimp dumplings. Julian doesn't eat fish but loves the spicy fish head. I remember everyone's preferences."

Sebastian: "..."

There was no need to remember quite that comprehensively.

But the fact she remembered his preference was enough to brighten his mood.

Alexander chuckled lightly. "Sophia is always so thoughtful, considering everyone's tastes."

The implication: You are not special.

Sebastian smiled, not angered. "Yes, she's been like that all these years."

The subtext: I knew her long before you were even on the scene.

Sophia focused on her meal, completely missing the underlying tension.

She had been busy in the lab all afternoon and was starving.

Right now, her eyes were only for the food.

"Mr. Evans, Professor, you should eat too."

Sebastian and Alexander responded simultaneously.

They glanced at each other, coldness flashing in both their eyes.

Sebastian suddenly raised his cup. "Sophia mentioned you helped find the lab. Let me thank you on her behalf, with tea instead of wine."

Alexander didn't reciprocate. "It was a small matter. Not worthy of your thanks, Mr. Evans."

"If thanks are due, Sophia should give them. You doing it on her behalf... isn't quite appropriate."

Sophia immediately picked up her teacup. "I really should thank you, Professor. For helping us find such a great lab."

Alexander waved his hand. "You would have found one without me. It was just a matter of time."

Sophia said seriously, "Time is the most precious thing. This cup is to you."

Alexander raised his cup solemnly and gently clinked it with hers. "You're too kind."

Sebastian sighed with feeling. "The Professor went to such trouble for his students. Truly commendable. This cup, Sophia and I toast to you together."

His tone was like a junior respectfully toasting a senior, placing Alexander on a very high pedestal.

Alexander: "..."

His knuckles tightened slightly.
###Chapter 308

Sebastian Evans began reporting on the week's construction progress.

The main structure was currently under construction.

Sophia Sullivan listened attentively.

She even slowed her chewing.

The Kung Pao chicken rotated to Alexander Laurent.

He scooped a spoonful, preparing to place it in her bowl.

Sebastian simultaneously picked up a piece of fish to offer her.

Both men's movements halted at the same time.

They looked up and locked eyes.

The air instantly froze.

Sebastian curled his lips into a smile. "The Professor is quite considerate."

Alexander remained expressionless. "Not as attentive as Mr. Evans."

Sophia looked at the spoon and chopsticks before her.

She spoke softly. "I'll take both."

The two men withdrew their hands.

Sebastian placed the fish in her bowl. "For protein."

Alexander set down the Kung Pao chicken. "It's not spicy. You should like it."

Sophia nodded in thanks. "Thank you, Mr. Evans. Thank you, Professor."

She maintained absolute fairness.

"Please, eat. There's no need to look after me."

The atmosphere remained subtle.

The restaurant door suddenly swung open.

Ryan Sullivan entered, bringing a chill with him.

He apologized repeatedly. "The traffic was terrible. I'm late."

Sophia looked up, surprised. "Brother? I thought you weren't coming this week?"

The three had agreed to meet five days prior.

But Ryan had to go to Zhejiang Province to select materials.

He had entrusted Sebastian to report the progress on his behalf.

So they hadn't waited for him and started the meal directly.

Ryan took off his coat and sat down. "The materials are all ordered. I returned last night. Visited the site today and thought face-to-face communication would be better."

Sophia called for the server to bring another set of utensils.

She also ordered two more dishes.

Ryan was starving.

He buried his head in his food, only looking up after slightly alleviating his hunger.

His gaze swept over Sophia before landing on Alexander.

A puzzled expression appeared on his face. "And this is...?"

Sophia immediately introduced him. "Professor Alexander Laurent, my professional course teacher and corresponding author. We happened to run into each other today and decided to have lunch together."

She then introduced Ryan to Alexander.

The two men shook hands in greeting.

Ryan had an ordinary educational background and held a natural reverence for academic giants.

He secretly searched for Alexander's name on his phone.

His eyes instantly became fervent.

He nodded emphatically at every word Alexander said.

He looked every bit the admiring fan.

Sebastian's face was expressionless.

Sophia understood her cousin's reaction.

Who wouldn't respect a god-level academic figure?

The four continued their meal, and the atmosphere eased considerably.

Sophia asked softly, "Brother, would you like to order more dishes?"

Ryan quickly waved his hand. "No need. I've eaten the most."

He seemed a little embarrassed.

"Did Mr. Evans already cover the project progress?"

Sophia nodded. "He just finished."

"At this rate, by the beginning of next month we can…"

Sophia listened carefully.

A voice suddenly interrupted. "What a coincidence. We meet again."

Ethan Roscente and Fiona Valentine stood at the entrance.

The same place. A second chance encounter.

Sebastian crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow. "Mr. Roscente has refined tastes. Dating in a small place like this every time. Don't you think it's beneath your girlfriend?"

Before Ethan could speak, Fiona smiled and replied. "I chose this place. It's near the school. Convenient, simple, and the food is good too."

Sebastian let out a meaningful "Oh." "Mr. Roscente is fortunate."

He always found such considerate partners.

Fiona's smile didn't falter as her eyes swept over the table. "Professor Laurent is here too? We're all acquainted. Why don't we join you?"

She looked at Ethan for his opinion.

Ethan's expression was indifferent. "As you wish."

Ryan suddenly stood up. "Excuse us, but we've finished."

Fiona was taken aback.

"You want this table? It's all yours." Ryan picked up his coat.

Alexander and Ethan stood up simultaneously.

Sophia also rose to her feet.

Ryan gestured. "Please, have a seat."

Fiona's expression stiffened.

Ethan's eyes turned cold.

Sebastian walked toward the cashier. "I'll get the bill."

Ryan followed. "I'll join you."

Sophia spoke softly. "Let's all go."

The four of them filed out of the restaurant.

Leaving Ethan and Fiona standing where they were.

Fiona looked down. "Sorry. It seems I messed up."

Ethan sat down expressionlessly.

He pushed the menu toward her. "Order."

Fiona carefully selected three dishes. "What would you like?"

Ethan shook his head. "Nothing."

While waiting for the food, he smoked three cigarettes in a row.

Amidst the swirling smoke, his eyes were gloomy and hostile.

…

Monday morning classes ended.

Sophia, Hannah Morse, and Marcus Lawrence hurried to Stanford University.

They changed into lab coats and began their busy work.

At noon, the three went to the cafeteria together.

Every serving station had long lines.

The line for Duck Blood and Vermicelli Soup was particularly exaggerated.

Sophia and Marcus frowned simultaneously.

Only Hannah was eager to try it.

A longer line meant better food.

Sophia chose the BBQ Pork Rice. "I'm going to the shorter line."

Marcus initially intended to follow.

Hannah grabbed her sleeve. "Little Mo~ Are you sure you don't want to try the Duck Blood and Vermicelli Soup? It's especially delicious!"

Marcus looked at the long line, her face full of refusal.

But meeting Hannah's expectant gaze, she inexplicably nodded.

Hannah jumped for joy.

The corner of Marcus's mouth lifted slightly.

Sophia got her food first.

Hannah and Marcus sat down shortly after.

"See! It didn't take long! Only a few minutes later than Sophia."

Marcus murmured in agreement. "Mhm."

"Huh? You're not eating the duck intestine?"

Marcus shook her head. "I don't eat offal."

"Then give it to me. Don't waste it."

She pushed her bowl over.

Marcus lowered her head and carefully picked out the duck intestines.

At twelve-forty, the three finished eating and prepared to leave.

Before they could exit the cafeteria, a boy suddenly rushed over and blocked Sophia's path.

He took a deep breath, his face turning red.

"U-um, miss, could you tell me what your major is? I've noticed you for a while. Could I get your WeChat?"
###Chapter 309

Hannah blinked, a look of complete understanding on her face.

Her eyes darted around rapidly.

She turned her head and found Marcus Lawrence staring right at her.

Hannah swallowed. "Why... why are you looking at me?"

Marcus's voice was low. "You weren't the one getting hit on. Why are you nervous?"

"I'm worried for Sophia. Getting stopped every day is such a hassle... Speaking of which, Marcus, she's so amazing. Don't you have any thoughts about her?"

Marcus shot her a glance. "Stop imagining things."

"Isn't it true?"

"No."

"...Then there's something wrong with your taste."

Marcus stared at her and suddenly laughed. "I think there's something wrong with my taste too."

Hannah: "?"

Meanwhile, Sophia Sullivan turned to the boy. "Sorry, I'm not a student here."

"No problem! Can I get your WeChat?"

"That's not convenient."

"Why?"

Sophia replied, "I have a boyfriend."

"Ah... I see..." The boy's face flushed red instantly. "My apologies for bothering you!"

He turned and ran away.

Sophia let out a sigh of relief.

The students who had been watching the spectacle gradually dispersed.

On the way back to the lab, Hannah suddenly asked, "Sophia, did you really get a boyfriend?"

"No. I was just brushing him off."

It was the most direct and effective reason.

"Are you going to handle all your admirers like that from now on?"

"Uh... Admirers? Isn't that an exaggeration? This is only the first one..."

"You're thinking too simply! A beautiful woman is popular wherever she goes. One today, a whole group tomorrow. Just you wait."

"...It can't be that bad, right?"

"Hmph."

At that time, Sophia didn't take Hannah's words seriously.

It wasn't until the next day, when another boy stood in front of her and asked the same question, that she realized how naive she had been!

For three days straight, every time she went to the cafeteria at noon, Sophia was stopped.

Although it was a different face each time, the opening line was always the same—

Can I get to know you?

Can I have your WeChat?

Your gaming ID works too!

The most outrageous time was when she was about to leave after finishing her meal, and two boys surrounded her simultaneously.

They both asked for her contact information at the same time.

Before Sophia could even open her mouth to refuse, the two started arguing.

It began as a war of words, but then someone threw the first punch, and they started brawling.

Finally, a faculty advisor who was eating in the cafeteria stepped in to break it up and prevent the situation from escalating.

From start to finish, it took less than ten minutes, but it drew spectators from all three floors of the cafeteria. Even the lunch lady serving food stuck her head out to see.

"What's going on?"

"Just to get her number?"

"That's insane! Anyone would think they were fighting over a girlfriend, but in the end..."

"I heard this girl has been getting stopped in the cafeteria for several days in a row. Today, someone actually fought over her. Impressive!"

"Who is she? Which department?!"

"No idea."

"Huh? Such a big scene, and no one even knows who the main character is? The gossip game this year is weak!"

"How would we know? She's not from our school."

"From another school?"

"A grad student from MIT next door. I think she's here to use the labs."

"..."

Discussions buzzed through the crowd.

The faculty advisor first lectured the two boys and sent them on their way. Then he called Sophia over to understand the situation.

"...So, did you give them your contact information?"

Sophia: "No."

"Neither of them?"

"No."

Right!

The truth was out. The girl hadn't paid either of them any attention. They had started fighting on their own.

The advisor was reasonable. This had nothing to do with Sophia. It was his own students who were lacking.

"It's fine. You can go."

After that, Sophia never went to the cafeteria at noon again. She either ordered takeout or asked Hannah to bring her food.

Finally, she had some peace.

But the incident became a topic of conversation for the Stanford students during their free time.

None of that concerned Sophia, however.

She closed her door and focused on her experiments, organizing data and writing her paper.

Any noise from the outside world fell on deaf ears.

...

The annual National Science Awards Ceremony was held at the Kyoto Convention Hall.

Alexander Laurent alone took home two major awards.

This drew the attention of everyone in the room.

Everyone present was a top figure in their field, but even among the best, there were gradients.

Alexander was undoubtedly among the few standing at the very pinnacle of the pyramid.

"Congratulations, Alexander. This is the third year in a row you've won an award, right?"

"You flatter me, Professor Feng. You won awards for five consecutive years back in the day, a record that still stands unbroken. My achievements are nothing in comparison."

"Haha... Alexander, you're still so modest!"

The awards he had won back then were far less prestigious than Alexander's.

But his words were gracious. Even if it wasn't true, it was pleasant to hear.

"The new generation surpasses the old. The future belongs to you young people. We old fossils are just doing our part by giving you a push, making the most of what's left, completing our journey."

"New generation or old, I only believe one thing—experience trumps youth."

"Hahaha... I'm no match for your silver tongue, no match at all." Feng Yuchun waved his hands repeatedly.

"But," he changed the subject, "speaking of the new generation, that MIT girl you recommended last time... Su... Su something..."

"Sophia Sullivan." Alexander subconsciously straightened his posture and supplied the name.

"Yes, yes. That girl's academic ability is truly outstanding. I asked and found out she's Professor Watson's student. No wonder she's so exceptional."

"How do you know she's capable?"

"I went to the lab to pick up an instrument once and happened to see her leading her team through an experimental procedure... Her thinking was clear, her reasoning is logically tight, and crucially, she considered every detail thoroughly, with corresponding verification methods for each step. I haven't seen such meticulousness and rigor in any other student."

"You said before... she's only a first-year master's student?"

"Yes." Alexander nodded.

"That makes it even more remarkable. She puts my second and third-year master's students to shame!"

A slight curve touched Alexander's lips, a trace of imperceptible pride flashing in his eyes.

"She has always been that outstanding."

"However," Feng Yuchun's tone shifted again, "with a seedling this promising, we must be even more careful. We can't let her be led astray."

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "You seem to be implying something else?"

"Ah," Professor Feng sighed. "You really don't know?"

Alexander said, "Please, tell me."

"Well, a few days ago, a faculty advisor from the department came to me. He said Miss Sullivan has been getting confessed to by boys in the cafeteria repeatedly. There were even two undergraduate students who came to blows over her..."
###Chapter 310

"Alexander, you recommended her. What's your take?"

Feng Yuchun finished speaking and tossed the question to him.

Alexander Laurent was silent for a moment.

"First, I don't believe Sophia did anything wrong."

"A flower blooms on a branch. It doesn't attract bees or butterflies, yet people still want to pick it. Can you blame the flower?"

"Second, the student quality at Stanford needs improvement."

"Fighting in public over a trivial matter will damage the school's reputation if it gets out. So—"

"Improving the quality of both faculty and students is urgent."

He emphasized the quality of both teachers and students.

"Finally, I trust Sophia. She is not a frivolous girl. No one considered her feelings in this matter. She is also a victim."

Feng Yuchun was hearing Alexander speak so much for the first time.

"Yes, yes, Miss Sullivan is not at fault. Being beautiful and attractive isn't her problem. How can we blame her?"

Alexander's expression softened slightly. "I'm glad you understand."

Feng Yuchun glanced at him, surprised. So protective?

"These boys at Stanford, they see a pretty girl and get all worked up, falling over themselves to impress her. Times are different now. If you like someone, just pursue them boldly!"

"If Sophia doesn't have a boyfriend, perhaps she could consider someone from our school? MIT and Stanford are close. Dating would be convenient. She could also use my lab long-term..."

Feng Yuchun found the idea more plausible the more he talked about it.

A marriage between the two schools would be a great story, wouldn't it?

Alexander's face darkened. "You called them monkeys yourself. Let's drop it."

Feng Yuchun: "?"

I was just being polite. Did you take it seriously?

Feng Yuchun wanted to say more, but Alexander had already stood up and left.

A voice came from the stage—

"Now presenting the winner of the National Special Prize for Scientific and Technological Progress, Alexander Laurent..."

Feng Yuchun was momentarily dazed.

In these three years, Alexander had won the Nature Prize, the Progress Prize, the Invention Prize... Next would be Academician, right?

The youngest Academician in history.

...

Night fell. Sophia finished her experiments and returned to her residence.

The cold wind was biting. She pulled her scarf up, covering half her face.

Just as she reached her door, before she could take out her key, the neighboring door opened.

Alexander stood behind it.

"Sophia."

"Professor!"

"Just finished your experiment?"

"Yes."

"Have you had dinner?"

She shook her head sheepishly. "Not yet."

"Come eat at my place."

"Ah?" Sophia was stunned. "You cooked?"

"Just made a couple simple dishes. Learned from you. Care to try them?"

"Learned from me?" She didn't remember teaching him how to cook.

"It's cold outside. Come in first."

"Okay." Sophia stepped inside. Warmth enveloped her.

She took off her scarf and removed her down jacket. Alexander naturally took them and hung them on the coat rack.

Sophia noticed a deep black suit hanging next to the coat rack.

It was impeccably straight, almost severe.

Alexander usually wore suits, but none looked as dated as this one.

She walked to the dining table.

On the table were two meat dishes, one vegetable dish, and a soup, all still steaming.

Alexander: "The braised pork ribs and shredded pork with green peppers, I learned from you. The stir-fried cabbage, I learned from a video. The tomato and egg soup, I already knew how to make."

He clearly explained the origin of each dish.

Sophia laughed. "Did I really teach you? I don't remember."

"No. But I observed secretly."

Alexander filled two bowls with rice. "Sit."

He then handed her the chopsticks.

"Thank you."

Sophia picked up a piece of rib. Under the man's expectant gaze, she put it in her mouth.

"This taste..."

She noticed the man's back was straight, his expression tense.

Sophia: "It's very fragrant. Even better than how I make it!"

The man visibly relaxed. A smile reappeared. "It's not as good as yours."

"Professor, don't be so modest!"

Sophia wasn't just being polite. It really did taste good.

"You just watched while helping and learned?"

Alexander: "I memorized the steps."

Smart people learn everything quickly.

The shredded pork with green peppers and the stir-fried cabbage were also delicious.

"Really?" Professor Laurent also had moments of insecurity.

Sophia couldn't help laughing. "No."

"?"

"Just kidding."

"..."

After eating, Sophia moved to collect the bowls. The man firmly refused.

"Go rest on the sofa. Play on your phone or watch TV. I'll handle the kitchen."

Sophia blinked. "At my place, we always cleaned up together."

Alexander: "That was your place. This is my place. My rules."

"? What logic is that?"

"Then next time you're at my place, I won't let you do anything either."

Hearing this petulant remark, Alexander couldn't help but curve his lips. He wasn't in a hurry to clean up. He sat back down. "Do you know why a research group needs a leader?"

Sophia: "?" What does this have to do with the current topic?

Alexander: "Everyone works on the same project. They do the same work. They get the same pay. So why have a leader? Sometimes the leader might even do less than the members."

"Why?"

"Because a team needs a core. A project needs a leader. This person doesn't need to do everything. They just need to steer the direction at critical moments. Like on a ship. The sailors work. The captain steers."

Sophia raised an eyebrow. "So... I'm the captain?"

Alexander nodded. "Good. The sailor is going to work now!"

He stood up and walked into the kitchen.

Sophia was stunned for two seconds, then couldn't help but laugh. She called out towards the kitchen:

"Professor—You're too modest! How could I possibly be your captain? You are the captain. You should be the one giving orders!"

"Mm, okay. Then I order you not to do any work. Next time we eat at your place, you cannot stop me from working." The man's voice came from the kitchen.

Sophia: ???

Somehow, he always has the last word.
###Chapter 311

Alexander finished cleaning the kitchen.

He walked into the living room.

Sophia had already prepared a plate of sliced fruit.

"You just can't stop finding things to do, can you?" He shook his head.

Sophia speared a piece of apple with a toothpick and offered it to him.

"Life is about movement. I don't want to be a couch potato."

Alexander took the apple.

"I need to take the trash out. Want to head down together in a bit?"

"Okay."

After disposing of the trash, Sophia remembered the fridge was empty.

She suggested going to the supermarket.

Alexander nodded.

They had just left.
Sylvia's car arrived at the mouth of the alley.

"Stop here. You can't drive in."

The driver responded, "Yes, ma'am."

Sylvia pushed the car door open.
She swapped her heels for a pair of flats.

She climbed all seven flights in one go.
This time, it was less taxing.

She took out her spare key.
After a moment's thought, she put it away.
She chose to knock instead.

Knock, knock, knock—
"Alexander, are you home?"

No one answered.
She used her key to open the door.

"Where is he?"

Her phone rang.
She answered it.

"Hello?"

Frederick: "You really went to our son's place?"
"Yes."

"What time is it? Disturbing his rest so late, what's the point?"

Sylvia searched every room.
"Strange... Alexander isn't here."

"He's not there?"
"I don't see him."

"A wasted trip. Why all the fuss?"

"He called tonight asking about star anise and bay leaves. He must be cooking."
"So he's cooking. What's the big deal?"

"Have you seen him cook since he returned? What's so special about today?"
"What's so special?"

"The National Science Awards Ceremony! I suggested booking a table to celebrate. He said he had something more important. More important than celebrating is cooking?"

"Is that so wrong?"
"What's the fun in cooking alone? It must be a celebration for two!"

Frederick: "You overthink everything. Our son makes one meal and you get suspicious."

"I'm not discussing this with you. You don't understand."

A triple blow.
Frederick fell silent.

"Struck out. When are you coming back?"
"I'll wait a little longer."

"Wait for what? Our son is dating, and you're acting like you're catching him in the act. Is that appropriate?"
"..."

"Alexander has good judgment. He'll tell us when the time is right."
"...That makes sense."

"It's the middle of winter. Aren't you cold? Come home now. I'm waiting for you to sleep."
"...Oh."

Sylvia walked out of the alley.
The driver pulled the car over.

"Ma'am."
Sylvia got in the car and sighed. "Let's go home."

The moment the car drove away.
Alexander and Sophia crossed the street, carrying shopping bags.

They passed each other, unseen.

Alexander took all the bags.
"Let me carry those."

Sophia didn't argue.
It was pointless.
They were indeed heavy.

As they reached the alley entrance, Alexander suddenly asked, "Are you settling in okay at Stanford?"

Sophia nodded.
"The lab equipment is comprehensive. Professor Feng is very kind. The senior students are thorough too; they even helped us register for supplies."

But she had paid for everything.
Borrowing the lab for free was already generous. She couldn't use the consumables without paying.

Alexander paused.
"Have you run into any trouble?"

Sophia thought for a moment.
The experiments were going smoothly. She had caught up on the progress.
She was keeping up with her major courses. Her last pop quiz was an A-, only because there was a problematic question nobody in the class got right...

She was about to shake her head.
Then she remembered something.

Alexander: "You hesitated. Is it about the cafeteria incident?"
Sophia turned her head sharply. "How did you know?"

"I ran into Professor Feng at a meeting this morning."

Sophia's mind raced.
Her eyes filled with apology.
"I'm sorry it reached Professor Feng. Did he... complain about me?"

She lowered her head.
Embarrassed and ashamed.

Borrowing the lab was a favor to Alexander.
Causing trouble that led directly to accountability...

"I'm sorry, Professor, I..."
"Why are you apologizing?" Alexander stopped walking.

Sophia looked up and met his deep gaze.
"...I've caused you trouble."

He sighed softly.
"You did nothing wrong. No need to apologize or feel burdened. As for causing trouble, do I look like someone who's afraid of trouble?"

Sophia studied him.
"No. Trouble should be afraid of you."

Alexander smiled.
"Good. Remember this for next time. If something like this happens again, refuse if you need to, walk away if you must. Remember—"

He spoke deliberately, word by word.
"If the sky falls, I'll hold it up. You have nothing to fear."

Sophia's heart skipped a beat.
Her eyes and nose tingled with emotion.

She blinked and rubbed her nose.
"Okay. But Professor Feng..."

"Don't worry about it. I reminded him to focus on improving the overall quality and ethos at Stanford."
It's simply outrageous!

Students who casually get into fights.
And a counselor who loves to tattle and make snide remarks.

It's time for a shake-up.

Sophia was silent.
Was this really okay?
Was it too brazen?

Alexander told her firmly.
"It's perfectly fine. Did they consider the consequences when they bullied you? Did they really think you had no one to back you up?"

Sophia was stunned.
He...
Was he standing up for her?
###Chapter 312

"Why are you looking at me like that?"

Sophia Sullivan said softly, "It's nothing."

"I just suddenly think you're really great, Professor."

He truly was.

So great it made her heart feel warm.

"Don't just stand there. Aren't you cold?" He smiled slightly.

Sophia rubbed her hands together. "A little cold."

...

Saturday morning.

Sophia got up early.

She made herself a sandwich.

And heated up some soy milk.

She timed it perfectly for Alexander Laurent's usual departure.

She handed him a paper bag with breakfast.

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "Breakfast?"

"Yes."

"Perfect timing. I haven't eaten yet. Thank you."

Alexander was heading to the lab.

Sophia was going too.

But she had to clean the apartment first.

She hadn't finished mopping the floor.

Her phone suddenly rang.

"Hello?"

"Sophia! It's Jade! You need to come to the hospital to see Professor Watson..."

The hospital room door was pushed open.

Sophia hurried in. "Professor?!"

Eleanor Watson lay in the hospital bed.

An IV drip was attached to the back of her hand.

Jade was pacing anxiously nearby.

Seeing Sophia, Jade let out a long sigh of relief. "Sophia, you're finally here!"

"Jade, what happened? Weren't you supposed to be at the retreat in the mountains?"

Every year, the university offered staff retreat spots.

Eleanor was certainly senior enough.

But she had always declined in previous years.

This year, Sophia had persuaded her to go.

Saying everything at the university was fine.

That she could handle Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence.

Only then did Eleanor agree.

Jade sighed. "We were supposed to leave yesterday. The Professor got a call in the morning. I don't know who it was from. Right after, this happened. I rushed her to the hospital."

Sophia frowned. "What did the doctors say?"

"Severe emotional distress. She needs to be observed in the hospital. But she was demanding to be discharged first thing this morning. The IV wasn't even finished. Her complexion was terrible, like she was ready to go fight someone."

Sophia was taken aback.

She walked to the bedside.

Eleanor happened to wake up.

Seeing her, Eleanor immediately became agitated. "Do you all think I'm dead?!"

Jade was startled. "Professor! What are you saying! This is Sophia!"

Sophia lowered her head silently.

So she had found out after all.

"Jade, could you go get some hot water? I'll help the Professor clean up later."

"Okay, you two talk." Jade picked up the thermos and lowered her voice. "The doctor said she mustn't be agitated again."

Sophia nodded.

Jade left the room.

The door closed.

Sophia looked at her fuming teacher.

She gently sat on the edge of the bed.

Eleanor glared. "Who said you could sit?! Stand up!"

"Professor, I ran all the way from the hospital entrance. I'm sweating in the middle of winter. Can't I sit for a moment?"

Eleanor saw the beads of sweat on her forehead.

Sophia took off her scarf and coat.

She felt a little more comfortable.

Eleanor patted the edge of the bed. "Sit then. But don't think this means I've forgiven you."

"Yes, yes. You're still angry. Of course it's not that easy to earn your forgiveness."

Eleanor snorted.

"So, who called yesterday morning? The one that made you so angry you ended up here?"

"Hmph!"

Sophia remained calm. "Let me guess... The Dean? No, he wouldn't bother with such trivial matters. Vice Dean Cunningham? I heard he's been getting complaints from sponsors lately, keeping his head down..."

She paused.

Her eyes shifted.

"Neither of them. Then the only person in the entire School of Life Sciences who could anger you like this must be—Victoria Lowell?"

Hearing that name, Eleanor's eyes immediately widened.

"Don't mention her to me!"

Sophia nodded. "Yes, she's the only one who would do something like this."

"Boring? If she hadn't said anything, I'd still be in the dark! A major fire safety overhaul in the lab, and you kept it from me?!"

"If I hadn't, you would have flown back from the conference, confronted the administration, only to find out we were indeed non-compliant and had to undergo the overhaul anyway. How long would that take? At best, two or three months. At worst, a year or more?"

"We'd still face the penalties. And you'd be absent from the conference, leaving without authorization, facing disciplinary action from the university."

"Who do you think would be happiest about that?"

"Wouldn't it still be Victoria Lowell?"

Eleanor let out an angry laugh. "So according to you, I'm a useless advisor?"

Sophia sighed softly.

Her voice softened.

"Professor, this was an inspection organized by the district, not an internal university one. If it were internal, I would have asked for your help immediately. But this was different. The district fire marshal's office was in charge. The university was just cooperating."

Eleanor snorted coldly. "You think my connections are only within the university?"

"Of course not! The name Eleanor Watson commands respect everywhere. But—"

Sophia's tone shifted.

"Our lab genuinely failed the inspection. If you used your connections, what if someone with ill intentions reported it?"

"Or, thinking even worse, what if this was a trap designed to lure you into action, just to slap a 'favoritism' charge on you—"

Eleanor had lived a life of integrity and honor.

Would her spotless reputation be ruined over something like this?

"Even if it was eventually cleared up, the facts remain: we were non-compliant, and you showed favoritism. There would be no defense."

Eleanor's expression changed.

From anger to shock.

Then to contemplation.

Finally, to complete calm.

Sophia took her hand.

She said softly, "Professor, trust me. I will handle this."

"How? By waiting for the overhaul?" Eleanor shook her head. "Impossible. Knowing Victoria Lowell, even if we pass the overhaul, she'll find another way to cause trouble."

"As long as you're still in the university lab, she will always find a reason..."

A slight smile touched Sophia's lips. "What if we're not?"

Eleanor jolted.
###Chapter 313

Sophia Sullivan calmed Professor Eleanor Watson and helped her freshen up.
She insisted the IV must finish before discharge.

Before leaving, she pulled the housekeeper aside.
"I've arranged with the sanatorium. A car will come for you tomorrow."
"Please take good care of the professor until then."

The housekeeper beamed. "You always know how to handle her, Sophia. She listens to you."
"Thank you for your patience."
"Don't worry. I'll look after her."

After Sophia left, the housekeeper reentered the room.
Professor Watson glanced past her. "She's gone?"
"Just left. She asked me to take good care of you. She's very thoughtful."
Professor Watson sighed softly. "She is a good girl."
"It's my age. I can't help them. I only make things harder with Professor Victoria Lowell targeting them."

"Sophia would never blame you. She's resourceful. If she says she has a plan, she does."
"She does. But I can't just do nothing..."
The housekeeper paused, surprised.
Professor Watson reached out. "Give me my phone. I need to make a call."

...

Time flew. It was time for their weekly meeting.
Sebastian Evans arrived first at the off-campus diner and had already ordered.
Ryan Sullivan came from the construction site. Sophia came from the lab. They arrived together.

"Brother!"
"Sophia, where's your scarf? It's freezing. You'll catch a cold."
"I left it at the lab. It's fine. I'll just zip my coat up high. See? It blocks the wind."
Ryan shook his head helplessly.

They entered the diner and spotted Sebastian immediately.
He wore a crisp suit. Even seated, his posture was impeccable. Broad shoulders, narrow waist. He stood out.
"Mr. Evans," Ryan greeted.
Sebastian's eyes were on Sophia. "Sophia, sit here."
He stood and pulled out a chair for her.

Ryan: "?" Am I invisible?
He pulled out his own chair and sat down, annoyed.
The food arrived promptly, perfectly timed.
A server brought their drinks.
Ryan saw his usual brand and immediately felt better.
This was Sebastian's particular talent.
He could make anyone feel attended to, if he wished.

"Mandarin Duet Pork?" Sophia was surprised. "Is this on the menu? I've never seen it."
They knew the menu by heart after so many visits.
Sebastian said, "It wasn't. It is now."
"Huh?"
"I suggested it to the owner last time. She learned how to make it."

Ryan gave him a thumbs-up. "Impressive, Mr. Evans."
"Sophia, you loved this as a kid, especially the fried kind..."
He stopped mid-sentence.
His eyes darted between them. Understanding dawned on his face.
Sebastian's lips curved slightly. "Let's eat while we talk."
"Oh!" Ryan remembered the agenda. "All floors are done this week."
"We consulted the elder for an auspicious date. The topping-out ceremony is next Wednesday..."

"That fast?" Sophia was stunned by the progress again.
"Thanks to Mr. Evans's two construction crews..."
They were initially borrowed for foundational work. But Ryan soon realized he'd underestimated them.
They were also experts in interior finishing and material selection.
So after the foundation, Ryan decided not to return them to Sebastian just yet.
They continued with the interior decration and smart system installation.

"...Is that alright with you, Mr. Evans?"
Sophia looked at Sebastian along with Ryan.
He met her gaze and smiled. "No problem."
If she asked, he could mobilize any number of crews.
"Thank you, Mr. Evans!"
"Call me Sebastian."
Sophia: "..." Here we go again.
Ryan grinned. "Heh... Thanks, Sebastian."
Sebastian: "?"

The meal concluded. Ryan went to settle the bill.
Sebastian stood first and walked to the counter. "Check, please."
"All done, Mr. Evans? How was the Mandarin Duet Pork?"
Sebastian looked back at Sophia. "Ask her."
The owner smiled over at her.
Sophia answered honestly. "It was delicious."
"Glad you liked it! It's been a hit lately. More popular than our signature dishes. Business is better."
"Really, thanks to Mr. Evans's suggestion."

Sebastian scanned to pay and put his phone away. "Don't thank me. Thank her."
The owner's smile widened, her eyes shifting between Sophia and Sebastian. "Of course! Of course! Thanks to both!"

They stepped outside. A cold wind hit them, rushing into their collars.
Sophia quickly zipped her coat all the way up but still shivered.
The next moment, Sebastian took off his own scarf and wrapped it around her neck.
Sophia was startled and tried to remove it. "No, it's fine. My coat is zipped up high..."
Sebastian ignored her protests. "Keep it on."
Sophia: "..."

...

At Stanford University's gate, Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence just left the lab, deep in discussion.
Hannah: "How about barbecue? I know a place with amazing potato skin and tofu skin skewers!"
"Stir-fried noodles are good too. Ever had dry-fried beef hor fun? A Cantonese classic!"
"Or maybe oden? Scallion pancakes? Congee with century egg and pork..."
She got hungrier listing options, patting her stomach.
It was flat.
Marcus: "..." Is this midnight snack absolutely necessary?
Hannah: "Decided yet? What to eat?"
"..."
"Don't tell me you're not hungry, Marcus!"
Marcus said seriously, "Eat. We must eat."
"Yes!"

As they headed for the food street, they ran into Alexander Laurent.
"Professor Laurent!"
Alexander nodded slightly. "Good evening. Just finished at the lab?"
"Mm-hmm!"
"...Is Sophia not with you?"
"Sophia had her weekly meeting with Mr. Evans. She left already."
Alexander's gaze fell on the bag in her hand. A corner of something familiar peeked out. "What's that?"
"Oh! Sophia's scarf. She forgot it. I was going to take it to her."
Alexander asked, "Where to?"
Hannah named the small diner.
Alexander said, "I'm heading that way. I can take it to her."
"Really? That's great!"
###Chapter 314

The streetlights cast a dim, yellowish glow.

Sophia Sullivan walked side by side with the two men.

A cold wind howled, their breath forming white puffs that vanished instantly.

"Clara, want some bubble tea? My treat." Ryan Sullivan offered with a bright smile.

Sophia was about to answer.

A young man suddenly stopped right in front of her.

All three of them froze.

Like magic, the boy produced a bouquet of roses from behind his back.

"Hi! I'm a third-year grad student at Stanford... I've noticed you for a while... these are for you..."

His cheeks flushed, his voice trembled.

"Could we exchange numbers? It was love at first sight..."

Sophia hadn't expected to get confessed to off-campus.

So this was why she hadn't run into Ethan Roscente or Fiona Valentine tonight.

Ryan's first instinct was to look at Sebastian Evans.

Sure enough, his expression was frighteningly dark.

His sister was too popular. Even a simple dinner out led to a confession.

Interesting.

Sophia looked at the roses and spoke softly. "The flowers are beautiful..."

The boy's eyes lit up. "Then you'll accept—"

"But I can't."

"Why not?"

"We're strangers. I can't accept gifts for no reason."

"You don't need a reason. I just wanted to give them to you."

"Roses symbolize love. Accepting them would send the wrong message."

"I'm not asking you to agree to anything right now..."

"But the ultimate goal is the same, isn't it?"

The boy was speechless.

He still refused to give up. "Can I at least get your WeChat?"

"No—" Sebastian stepped forward, pulling Sophia firmly into his arms.

The boy stared. "Who are you?"

Sebastian raised an eyebrow. "Isn't it obvious? I'm her boyfriend."

"What?!" The boy's eyes widened.

"Surprised?" Sebastian's lips curved. "Or do I not look the part?"

The boy's gaze darted between them.

Seeing Sophia offer no denial, he instantly deflated.

"I asked around... They said you didn't have a boyfriend..."

"Just started dating. Your intel is outdated, pal." Sebastian chuckled lightly.

The boy's face burned crimson. He muttered "Sorry" and fled.

He didn't even stop to pick up the roses he'd dropped.

Ryan watched him go, shaking his head with a sigh.

"Poor guy... Mustered all his courage to confess, and this happens..."

Sebastian shot him a glance. "Speaking from experience? Been rejected too?"

Ryan bristled. "Nonsense! I've never even confessed!"

"Oh, so you were about to, but found out she was already taken."

"!"

Sophia frowned. "Sebastian, you can let go now."

Not only did he not release her, he held her tighter.

He could feel the bones of her slender shoulders even through her down jacket.

A faint, sweet scent drifted into his nostrils.

Sebastian's body stiffened slightly.

Sophia twisted away deftly, breaking free from his arm.

Sebastian quickly reached out to grab her.

One dodged, the other pursued.

Sophia was annoyed. "Sebastian! Will you stop!"

A smile finally reached the man's eyes. "Finally not calling me 'Mr. Evans'."

"..."

As they tussled, Alexander Laurent stood under a streetlight not far away.

He held a paper bag.

Half his face was hidden in shadow, his expression unreadable.

"Professor?" Sophia noticed him first.

Alexander walked over slowly, his gaze sweeping over the man's scarf around her neck.

It wasn't Ryan's.

Sebastian wore an overcoat and suit—no scarf.

"Professor Laurent!" Ryan greeted with a smile. "What a coincidence!"

"Not a coincidence. I came specifically."

Alexander took a scarf from the paper bag and stepped forward, replacing the man's scarf around Sophia.

He carefully wrapped it for her.

"Met your classmate at the campus gate. Brought it along since it was on my way."

"Thank you, Professor!" Sophia snuggled into her own scarf, warmth spreading.

Her own was always the most comfortable.

Alexander offered a faint smile. "It was nothing."

Sebastian took back his scarf, leisurely retying it around his own neck.

"Delivering a scarf. Such a trivial matter required a personal trip, Professor Laurent?"

Alexander's expression remained neutral. "I said it was on my way."

He turned to Sophia. "I'm heading home. Coming?"

"Sure! Ryan, I'm heading off!"

"...Be careful on the road."

The two walked away side by side.

Sophia asked quietly, "Professor, what brought you to Stanford?"

Alexander replied, "Had some matters to discuss with Professor Feng."

"This late?"

"...He's a night owl."

"I see..."

Their conversation faded into the distance.

Sebastian stood rooted to the spot, his gaze deep and unreadable.

Ryan finally caught on. "Sophia and Professor Laurent... going home together? What's going on?!"

Sebastian snorted coldly. "Took you long enough."

"I..."

"You didn't even notice your sister getting whisked away! Be more alert!"

With that, he turned and walked off, his scarf fluttering in the wind.

Cold and intimidating.

Ryan: "?"

"Explain yourself! Who's whisking my sister away? I think you're the one trying to—"

One, two, three of them!

Heh... my sister's something else.
###Chapter 315

The second snow of December fell upon Kyoto.

It snowed for two days and two nights.

The entire city was blanketed in white.

Early morning.

Sophia Sullivan stood at Alexander Laurent's doorstep.

She knocked gently.

"Professor..." Her voice was hesitant.

Alexander opened the door in his pajamas.

His hair was slightly disheveled.

"What's wrong?" He looked concerned.

"Nothing, nothing!" Sophia quickly waved her hands.

She glanced at the time.

"Am I too early?"

Alexander rubbed his temples. "I was already awake. What is it?"

"Those snow play tools from last time... can I borrow them again?"

He looked out the window.

The snow had stopped.

"You want to play now?" He sounded surprised.

Sophia's eyes sparkled. "The snow hasn't been touched yet."

Alexander chuckled. "Like a little child."

"Is there an age limit for playing in snow?" She pouted.

"Only the distinction between southerners and northerners."

"Wait a moment."

He turned and went inside.

Soon he returned carrying a small bucket.

Inside were duck-shaped molds.

Along with little bears and dinosaurs.

Shovels and rakes were all included.

"Thank you, Professor!" Sophia took the bucket.

She quickly ran downstairs.

Ten minutes later.

Alexander appeared downstairs fully dressed.

Sophia was playing with a group of children.

Her white down jacket.

And red knit cap.

Stood out vividly against the snow.

"Professor! Come play with us—" She waved with a smile.

Alexander stood at a distance. "You play."

Sophia humphed softly.

She crouched down to make a snowball.

Suddenly she turned.

The snowball flew straight toward Alexander.

He stood frozen in place.

The snowball hit his shoulder.

Shattering into powder.

"Professor, why didn't you dodge?" Sophia ran over.

"I didn't react in time."

"I'm sorry..."

"It's fine." He smiled faintly.

The children pulled at Sophia. "Sister! The snowman isn't finished yet!"

She was dragged back to the snow pile.

Carefully she placed the nose on the snowman.

"Done!" She patted her hands with satisfaction.

"Sophia Sullivan!"

Alexander suddenly called her name.

She instinctively turned around.

A snowball flew past her neck.

"Professor!" Her eyes widened.

Alexander curved his lips. "Almost."

"I thought you weren't playing?" She stamped her foot.

"Suddenly felt like it."

"Sneak attacks don't count!"

"Learned from you."

...

The monthly departmental symposium arrived.

All faculty and students gathered in the auditorium.

Administrators sat on the podium.

Each research team presented their reports.

Caleb Watson from Professor Victoria Lowell's team published an SCI paper.

Ashley Lowell also had a paper published.

Though not SCI.

It was still in a core journal.

"Professor Lowell's team is too strong."

"Caleb is always so outstanding."

"Didn't Ashley just publish an SCI last month?"

"The speed is incredible."

"And she still participates in club activities regularly."

"Truly capable people excel at everything."

Blake Cunningham tapped the microphone. "Next group."

Sophia Sullivan stood up.

"Laboratory fire safety renovations."

"No research achievements this month."

As she was about to sit down.

Shane Holloway snorted dismissively.

"Zero output for a whole month."

"Is it really about renovations or capability issues?"

Hannah Morse jumped to her feet.

"You know exactly why we're doing renovations!"

"What does that have to do with us?" Shane raised an eyebrow.

"Your own fire safety failures are someone else's fault?"

"Does being fat make you talk nonsense?"

Hannah's eyes burned with anger.

Ashley crossed her arms with a cold smile.

"Your own incompetence affects results."

"But shifting blame comes naturally."
###Chapter 316

Sophia Sullivan remained silent.

The lab restructuring was a fact.

The lack of output was also a fact.

She didn't need to argue.

She sat back down.

Amelia Roscente's seat was right next to hers.

Amelia couldn't hold back a light laugh. "Sophia Sullivan, so this is your day."

"Life has its ups and downs," Sophia said calmly. "The wheel of fortune turns."

"Still so stubborn!"

Sophia looked straight ahead.

Not a trace of anger showed on her face.

Amelia was infuriated by her composure. "Do you really think you can outmaneuver Professor Lowell? Eleanor Watson is old. She can't compete for resources or influence anymore. Being her student, you're isolated and vulnerable. You're just a target."

"Back then, we fought tooth and nail to become Eleanor Watson's graduate students. You won. I lost. But who could have predicted things would turn out like this?"

"So winning isn't always winning, and losing isn't always losing. You probably didn't see this coming either, did you?" Amelia's lips curled into a smug smile.

What did it matter if she was first in the entrance exams?

What did a stellar interview mean?

She bought that CPRT Dynamometer with her own money, and in the end, she still had no lab to use it in.

"Sophia, after you broke up with my brother, how did you manage to sink even lower? Did you think getting into grad school was your big comeback? That it would make my brother see you in a new light? That it would make my mom regret losing you as a daughter-in-law? You're delusional!"

Sophia smiled.

Her eyes and the curve of her lips were full of genuine amusement.

"From what you're saying... it sounds like my getting into grad school was a successful comeback. Your brother did see me in a new light. And your mother does regret losing me. Is that right?"

"You—"

"But unfortunately," Sophia's smile vanished, "I pursued graduate studies because I wanted to learn. Any 'comeback' in your eyes was merely incidental. As for what your brother or your mother thinks, it's irrelevant to me. Because—"

"No matter how highly your brother might think of me now, no matter how much your mother might regret it, I would never go back."

"You're ungrateful!" Amelia snapped.

"Oh."

"Hopeless! Shameless!"

Sophia: "You're just raging impotently. Your entire family is projecting their own nonsense."

"?!"

Caleb Watson sat next to Amelia.

He hadn't caught every word of their exchange, but seeing Amelia's gritted teeth and furious expression told him it wasn't a friendly chat.

Jude Granger nudged his shoulder. "Caleb, why do Amelia and Ashley always have it in for Sophia?"

"This world has its share of strange people," Caleb said quietly. "They themselves are lacking, so they can't stand to see others succeed. In the end, they fail in both character and capability."

Jude looked slightly confused.

He took a few seconds to process it. "Exactly! But I think Ashley is actually very capable. I hardly ever see her in the lab, yet she quietly published another paper. I wish I could be that good someday…"

A look of yearning crossed Jude's face.

He hadn't officially started his research project yet.

Professor Victoria Lowell didn't pay him much attention.

Amelia and Shane Holloway already had their own research directions and projects.

Ashley Lowell went without saying.

Any good resources Professor Lowell had were funneled her way.

Only Jude, the earnest one.

He didn't come from a wealthy family like Amelia.

He wasn't as smooth-talking and ingratiating as Shane.

He certainly didn't have Ashley's innate luck.

So he could only tough it out patiently.

The only silver lining was that his fellow townsman, Caleb, was willing to lend a hand.

Blake Cunningham spoke. "...All the groups have reported, correct? Are there any other matters to declare?"

It was standard procedure.

After each group's report, time was allotted for announcing formal declarations within the school.

These weren't trivial matters worth bringing up in a meeting.

They involved major issues like personnel changes, reports of misconduct, or expulsions.

A representative from the oversight committee would publicly read the declaration to ensure fairness and transparency.

Usually, this segment was mentioned and quickly passed over.

Because there was nothing to declare.

Everyone assumed today would be the same.

But then—

The oversight committee representative on the stage stood up. "There is one item."

The room erupted in murmurs.

Even Blake Cunningham raised a surprised eyebrow.

"The specific matter is a notification letter regarding the application from Sophia Sullivan's research group to establish a self-funded laboratory off-campus. We have received it and are currently verifying the relevant procedures. Further developments will be reported promptly to the school and university administration."

His words landed like a thunderclap.

"Self-funded lab? What does that mean?"

"Did I hear that correctly?"

"Who's building a lab? Another university-enterprise collaborative research studio? Those aren't called labs…"

"Key point—notification letter, not application. That means Sophia's group has already taken action. This declaration is just a procedural formality!"

"Wow—the news lately always feels so surreal. First, someone spent a fortune on a CPRT Dynamometer. Now someone's building their own lab?! Is a lab like a cabbage you can just plant wherever you want?"

"Uh! Is it possible the people who bought the CPRT and are building the lab are the same group?"

"Huh?!"

"…"

The crowd buzzed with discussion.

The members of Professor Victoria Lowell's team were stunned into wide-eyed silence.

Shane looked utterly bewildered. "Wh-What are they saying up there?"

Ashley murmured, "How is that possible…"

Amelia's eyes were also wide with disbelief. "Sophia is… building a lab?"

Caleb listened, momentarily stunned.

Then, understanding dawned.

What a masterstroke!

They were actually doing something most people wouldn't even dare to imagine.

In that moment, a wave of self-disgust washed over him—

Disgust for himself, content to be trapped in a cage, lacking even the courage to try to spread his wings.

Compared to Sophia, he felt like a complete failure.

Jude was also shocked.

But he recovered quickly. "Sophia and her team are amazing! They're building their own lab?! My god, is that even possible? I heard building a lab takes not just time and money, but the approvals are super difficult. Especially for a bio-lab, the authorities are usually very strict. How…"

They made it sound as simple as eating or drinking?

"But a lab belonging to your own team sounds incredible! No more having to kowtow to the school, no more worrying about being reported or framed…"

Jude was fiercely envious again.

"Country bumpkin! No sense of the world!" Shane snarled viciously.

Jude frowned. "Have you ever seen anyone build their own lab? Name one other person who has."

Shane: "…"

"Can't name one? Then you haven't seen it either, right? So you're a country bumpkin too?"

"You—"

"What about me? It's true!"

Shane: "?" Since when did the pushover talk back?
###Chapter 317

Professor Victoria Lowell's face instantly darkened.

The words "self-funded laboratory" struck her eardrums.

Her pupils constricted sharply.

Her fingernails dug into her palms.

Absurd.

Ridiculous.

How could Sophia Sullivan possibly do this?

Back when she was at her lowest point.

All the institute's resources were towards Professor Eleanor Watson.

She had no funding.

She had no personnel.

She couldn't even secure the most basic lab equipment.

She had also considered building her own lab back then.

But it remained just a thought.

The approval process was as complex as a maze.

Land selection criteria were extremely strict.

Construction standards were stringent down to the millimeter.

Without substantial financial backing.

Without powerful connections to pave the way.

It was pure fantasy.

A sarcastic smirk twisted Victoria's lips.

"Professor Lowell?" Ashley Lowell leaned in and whispered.

"Some people are delusional," Victoria scoffed coldly. "It's just an application. Completion is still a long way off."

Ashley's eyes lit up. "You mean they can't possibly build it?"

"A pipe dream," Victoria said, lifting her chin. "When they wake up, we'll see how they handle the fallout."

Ashley snickered. "Should we do something about it?"

"Unnecessary." Victoria's gaze was dismissive. "They boasted themselves. Let them fall on their own faces."

"You always see things so clearly," Ashley flattered.

"Mind the occasion," Victoria glanced at her briefly.

"Yes, Professor Lowell~"

The monthly research symposium adjourned.

But the discussion only grew louder.

It was all doubts and sarcasm.

Blake Cunningham returned to his office and immediately summoned the oversight committee.

"Who submitted the application? Was it Professor Watson's idea or did the students act on their own?"

The head of the oversight committee remained expressionless.

"No comment."

Blake frowned. "Lao Zheng, after over a decade of friendship, can't you share even a little information?"

Mr. Zheng looked serious. "This time is different."

"How is it different?"

"A self-funded lab is a first for the institute. The higher-ups are watching. Would I dare speak carelessly?"

Blake's heart tightened.

It had actually reached the upper management.

He softened his tone. "Just a hint. Who proposed the application?"

Mr. Zheng was silent for a moment.

"Sophia Sullivan's team themselves."

Blake immediately breathed a sigh of relief.

As long as Professor Watson wasn't involved.

Three students couldn't possibly make waves.

He hummed a tune as he sat back in his office chair.

The entire institute was waiting to see them become a laughingstock.

However—

Early January.

The winter wind was bitingly cold.

Sophia Sullivan's laboratory was quietly completed.
###Chapter 318

It took two months and three days.

The cost was eighteen million.

A fully intelligent control system.

A dual biosafety protection system.

The laboratory was officially completed after the third winter snow stopped.

Ryan Sullivan led the technical team for the final system debugging.

The experimental instruments Sebastian Evans procured through overseas channels arrived one after another.

Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence were incredibly busy.

They had to familiarize themselves with the smart system's operation.

They also had to inventory the instruments and arrange the layout.

From positioning the lab benches to categorizing the equipment.

They personally managed every detail.

Apart from attending classes, eating, and sleeping.

They spent all their time in the laboratory.

In the Lawrence family living room—

"Marcus, going out again?"

"Yes, Grandma."

"No classes on Saturday, why are you always running out? Got a girlfriend?" The old lady's eyes sparkled.

"No."

"Then what are you going to do?"

"Big things." Marcus Lawrence tied his scarf and picked up his backpack. "I'm heading out first."

The old lady dismissed it. "What big things could a kid have?"

The grandfather reading the newspaper smiled without a word.

As Marcus Lawrence rushed to the laboratory.

Hannah Morse also got into a taxi.

"Driver, to the eastern suburbs."

"It's all construction sites over there. What are you going for?"

Hannah said seriously, "Big things."

On the way, she received a call from Henry Morse—

"Hey~ Pops! What's up~"

"Such a long time without calling? Dad misses you!"

"I miss you too~ Mwah! Mwah!"

Two flying kisses made Henry Morse beam with joy.

"Miss me but don't contact me? Who are you trying to fool?"

"I've been super busy lately! Spinning like a top!"

"Busy with what? Tell Dad?"

"You'll know very soon!"

"Still keeping it a secret?"

"Hehe…"

Henry Morse suppressed his curiosity. "Don't make Dad wait too long!"

Hannah estimated the time. "Absolutely not! I'm here, gotta go!"

"Hey— sweetie?!"

The call had already ended.

Henry Morse held his phone, feeling a sense of loss.

He suddenly regretted letting his daughter study up north.

Wouldn't studying at a local university have been fine? Why go so far away.

Just as he was feeling sentimental, a shout came from downstairs—

"Landlord! The water pipe burst, get someone to fix it quickly!"

Henry Morse leaned out the window. "Coming!"

…

Marcus and Hannah were running around frantically.

Sophia Sullivan was even busier, working non-stop.

Just fingerprint authorization took a whole day.

Sophia Sullivan sat in front of the fingerprint machine.

Ryan Sullivan operated on his tablet, and she entered each authorization.

Over nine hundred authorizations entered repeatedly.

Her fingers were almost numb from pressing.

In between, she had to answer supplier calls.

Sign for international logistics equipment.

Verify quantities and settle final payments.

She had no time to rest.

Even drinking water was only when Ryan Sullivan reminded her.

After a week of continuous busy work.

The laboratory was finally fully ready.

Everything was set, just waiting for the unveiling!

…

The first to receive the invitation was Henry Morse.

Hannah had sent the express delivery two days early.

When he received the call, Henry Morse was still puzzled.

Did his wife shop online again?

Why was his phone number used?

Could it be a Hermès cash on delivery?!

"That woman!"

Mrs. Morse, who was fumigating with mugwort: "?" What nonsense is this?

Henry Morse ran downstairs to get the package and rushed back up.

Seeing the sender—

It was from his daughter!

He immediately broke into a happy smile.

"Who sent it?" Mrs. Morse asked, waving the moxa stick.

The living room was filled with smoke.

Henry Morse directly tore open the envelope. "From our sweetie."

"What did our daughter send? It's not a bill, is it?"

Henry Morse paused. "It can't be? I just gave her ten million!"

Mrs. Morse immediately got angry. "She asks and you give? If she asks for the national treasury next, will you go rob it?"

"You nag for half a year if I buy a few bags, won't let me change the car, but our daughter's words are so effective? I'm the one who gave birth to her!"

"What did she need ten million for? What if she learns bad habits?"

Henry Morse: "To build a laboratory!"

Mrs. Morse snorted. "Build a laboratory? Doesn't MIT have labs? She needs to build her own? Burning money?"

"Yesterday I saw news about a rich second generation spending millions on male models. What if she's tricked by a man?"

"It's all my fault for not having a son. All the money is spent on our daughter. Once she marries, she'll be part of another family…"

Speaking of her sadness, Mrs. Morse's eyes reddened.

Her life had been smooth sailing.

She was the beloved youngest daughter in her family.

She married Henry Morse, who was in business.

They caught up with demolition and relocation and became landlords.

Her only regret was not having a son.

Which family in their region doesn't have a son?

Not having one means being gossiped about behind your back!

Even though Henry Morse never minded.

And her in-laws never gave her a hard time.

But Mrs. Morse could never get over this hurdle.

"There you go again! Sons, sons when young, still hung up on it when old? How many times have I told you, having Hannah is enough!"

"Our daughter is healthy, has a good appetite, was first in her school, top ten in the province for college entrance exams, got into MIT for grad school. Who doesn't say the Morse family ancestors are blessed?"

"I don't mind, why do you care? You're the one with son preference! My old leader said women hold up half the sky!"

Mrs. Morse pursed her lips. "If we had a son, you wouldn't say that…"

Henry Morse was too tired to argue. "I can't reason with you."

He pulled out a red cardstock from the envelope.

Seeing the content, he immediately beamed with laughter: "Hahaha… That's my girl! Just amazing!"

Mrs. Morse was still wiping tears. "What is it?"
###Chapter 319

Everyone Awaits the Spectacle

Henry Lorenz slid the gilded invitation across the table to her.

"See for yourself."

Mrs. Lorenz took the invitation.

Her eyes scanned the contents.

Her expression gradually froze.

"A laboratory unveiling ceremony? They actually built it?"

"My daughter is in no way inferior to any son. Why must you constantly harp on that? I forbid you from saying such things again... even in private. Understood?"

Mrs. Lorenz turned her face away.

"I'm talking to you!"

"I know! Your daughter is your precious jewel. Not a word against her, not a touch!"

Only then did Henry Lorenz break into a smile.

"That's more like it."

"..."

That afternoon, the couple packed their bags and hurried to the airport.

As their car passed the village entrance—

"Landlord, off for some sea fishing again?"

"Not the coast this time. Heading to Kyoto."

"All that way?"

"Going to see my daughter."

"Did something happen?"

Henry Lorenz: "She's doing big things!"

"??"

...

That same day, both the university administration and the School of Life Sciences received their invitations.

The University President held the invitation, his brow slightly furrowed.

"A first-year graduate student from the School of Life Sciences built her own lab? And is holding an unveiling?"

He looked at the Vice President, his gaze questioning.

The Vice President cleared his throat softly. "I just received the news as well. The School of Life Sciences did not report this beforehand."

"This Sophia Sullivan... is she the one who recently published the paper in 'Science'?"

"That's her."

"Built her own laboratory?" The President found the notion utterly novel.

The Vice President wiped his temple. "Probably just the students dabbling, a small-scale affair..."

"Professor Eleanor Watson sent the invitation personally. Do you still think it's a small-scale affair?"

The President's gaze was sharp.

The Vice President: "But building a lab is no trivial matter..."

"As the university, we should be considering why a student would build a lab off-campus when we have facilities here. Does this suggest academic inequity? Is there suppression at play?"

"Then... what is your opinion?"

The President rubbed the edge of the invitation, pondering for a moment.

"Since the invitation has arrived, we must go and see."

See what these students could possibly pull off!

At the same time, in the School office—

The Dean flung the invitation onto Blake Cunningham's desk.

"Look what you've done! The university knows! Whether Sophia's lab is real or not, this has blown up. If higher-ups investigate, no one will escape blame!"

With that, he stormed out.

Blake Cunningham's fingers trembled.

Sophia Sullivan dared to go straight to the President!

Her audacity knew no bounds!

Building a lab?

What a joke!

This was clearly a ploy to create pressure, to force the School to concede.

What a cunning move!

His assistant glimpsed the invitation's contents—

Unveiling ceremony tomorrow.

"Dean... what should we do?"

Blake Cunningham's face was like dark water.

After a long silence.

"...Send for Professor Victoria Lowell."

The assistant soon returned with her.

"What is it?"

Victoria Lowell stood arms crossed before the desk, her posture haughty.

Blake Cunningham pointed to a chair.

"Sit."

Victoria Lowell frowned. "I'm busy. State your business."

"Sit." Blake Cunningham repeated.

"Dean Cunningham, I said I'm busy, I don't have time—"

"I said SIT! Are you deaf?! Must I crane my neck to speak to you?! Who do you think you are?! I gave you face?! Have you forgotten who built you up?! Who fights for your resources every year?!"

"Without me, could you have snatched funding from Eleanor Watson?! A well-fed dog dares to snarl at its master now!"

Victoria Lowell was stunned by the tirade.

"You... how could you..."

Blake Cunningham had never lost his temper with her like this before.

"I. Said. SIT. DOWN!"

Victoria Lowell dared not be arrogant any longer and obediently sat down.

"What is it?" Her tone was now cautious.

Blake Cunningham sneered, grabbed the invitation, and threw it in her face.

"See for yourself!"

Victoria Lowell, struck, didn't dare make a sound.

She picked up the invitation. Her pupils constricted sharply as she read the contents.

"Lab unveiling?! Impossible!"

"The Dean brought it himself! The university received it too! How could it be fake?!"

"Sophia Sullivan dares to involve the university? She's utterly—"

Victoria Lowell was both shocked and furious.

She knew things would be hard to control once they escalated.

"Anyway," she took a deep breath, "I don't believe they actually built a lab. It must be a bluff, to pressure us into making a mistake!"

Blake Cunningham clearly agreed.

"Now that the university knows, the only way out is to prove Sophia's team is just fooling around. Otherwise—"

The things Victoria Lowell had done couldn't withstand scrutiny.

It was fine only because no one was looking. A deep investigation would expose everyone!

Victoria Lowell: "The unveiling is tomorrow. I don't believe they can conjure a lab out of thin air!"

Blake Cunningham: "Neither the School nor the university believes it. Since Sophia wants to make a scene, we might as well add fuel to the fire."

Victoria Lowell's heart jumped. "...What do you mean?"

Blake Cunningham narrowed his eyes. "If she wants a spectacle, let's give her a grand one. Sophia wants attention? I'll help her get it!"

"Tyler—get in here!"

The assistant pushed the door open. "Dean?"

"Notify the University Communications Office. Have reporters and writers from the 'Campus Gazette' accompany us tomorrow to observe the unveiling ceremony."

When everyone expects to see a lab, and Sophia has nothing to show, the scene will be glorious.

Compared to three students making fools of the university, their own mistakes would pale in significance.

A smirk touched Victoria Lowell's lips. "The older the ginger, the spicier it is."

Tomorrow, they would watch Sophia Sullivan hoist by her own petard.

The thought was exhilarating.

"I'll have the students from my team come too."

Blake Cunningham smiled. "Bring them all. The more, the merrier."
###Chapter 320

The night deepened, moonlight soft as water.

Sophia Sullivan stood at the lab entrance, taking one last look.

"Sweep Cloud, lights off."

"Please perform authorization recognition." A mechanical voice echoed in the air.

Sophia looked up.

"Recognition successful. Lights off."

Three seconds later, the lab plunged into darkness.

The main door automatically closed and locked.

Smart labs were indeed convenient.

She took out her phone to call a ride, but saw the door of a Porsche parked by the curb open.

Sebastian Evans stepped out of the car.

Sophia was surprised. "Why are you still here?"

Sebastian had come by that afternoon to check on the equipment installation.

A simple phone call could have handled it, yet he made the trip personally.

"Just wanted to see your new lab."

Mentioning the lab, Sophia immediately got excited and gave him a tour.

That tour lasted an hour.

Seeing she still had work, Sebastian took his leave.

Sophia thought he had left long ago. She never expected...

Sebastian said, "I was waiting for you."

"You really didn't have to..."

The man interrupted her. "Get in the car first. It's late."

Sophia softly thanked him.

Sebastian smiled. "That's more like it. Say something I like to hear."

He personally opened the car door for her.

On the road—

"What's the name of that smart robot just now?"

Sophia replied, "Sweep Cloud."

"Who named it?"

"My brother."

"Any meaning behind it?"

"'Sweep away a thousand armies, clouds gather and dragons soar.'"

"Didn't expect Ryan Sullivan to be so cultured..."

Sophia picked up her phone. "I'm going to record this and send it to him."

"Go ahead. I'm praising him. You didn't get it just now. Want me to say it again?"

Sophia was speechless.

When it came to thick skin, no one could beat Sebastian Evans.

Twenty minutes later, the car stopped at the mouth of the alley.

"We're here."

Sophia unbuckled her seatbelt. "Thank you, Mr. Evans. Saved me the cab fare again."

"Anytime you want, you can save. Consider me your free driver?"

Sophia shook her head. "Not considering it."

"Why not?"

"There's no such thing as a free lunch. If there is—"

Sebastian raised an eyebrow. "Then what?"

"I'd be the lunch."

The man chuckled lowly. "Getting smarter."

"Got burned once, so I learned my lesson."

"But you can't tar everyone with the same brush."

Sophia thought for a moment. "Better to mistakenly eliminate than to let one slip. Might as well overturn the whole boat."

Sebastian was momentarily speechless.

"...That strict?"

Sophia said, "Scientific research requires meticulousness."

Sebastian fell silent.

"Here." Sophia took an envelope from her bag and handed it over.

"What's this?"

"An invitation. The lab was built so quickly thanks to your help, Mr. Evans. How could we have the unveiling ceremony without the main功臣?"

Those two construction teams had contributed greatly.

They shortened the construction period by a third.

Sebastian took it and opened it. "Red?"

"For good luck."

"People might mistake it for a wedding invitation."

Sophia said, "The completion of the lab is a happy occasion too."

Sebastian nodded. "Good, I'll accept it! I'll be there on time tomorrow!"

Sophia pushed the door open and got out.

Suddenly, he called out to her—

"One more question."

She turned back. "What?"

Sebastian waved the invitation. "Does Ethan Roscente have one?"

Sophia frowned. "Can we not mention him?"

"Well, expected. Just confirming. What about Alexander Laurent?"

Sophia nodded. "Of course, the professor gets one."

"With building the lab, what did he contribute?"

"He helped us find a temporary lab so our research wasn't delayed."

Sebastian was silent.

Sophia said, "If there's nothing else, I'll head in."

"Alright. See you tomorrow."

He watched her go upstairs until her room light turned on before driving away.

...

Sophia finished her shower, changed into fluffy pajamas, and went to knock on Alexander Laurent's door.

"Professor? Are you home?"

No response.

She had knocked once already when she returned.

Forty minutes had passed, still no one...

Just as she was about to leave, footsteps came from downstairs.

"Professor, you're back?!"

Alexander turned the corner and paused slightly.

Under the dim yellow light, Sophia stood at the top of the stairs, smiling at him.

For a moment, he thought his eyes were playing tricks on him.

Only when that "Professor" reached his ears did he believe it was real.

"Sophia? Why are you standing outside?"

"I came to find you, but you weren't in. I was just about to go back."

Alexander climbed the last step and stopped before her. "Something up?"

"I wanted to—" She suddenly stopped, leaning forward to sniff. "Professor, have you been drinking?"

Alexander's ears turned slightly red. "Sorry... Does it smell strong?"

He took a few steps back, creating distance.

"No..." Sophia shook her head. The scent of alcohol couldn't cover the faint woody fragrance he carried.

"An old colleague from my time in the States is in Kyoto on business. We hadn't seen each other for years, so we met for dinner and had a few extra drinks."

"Are you okay?" Sophia wanted to ask if he was drunk.

Alexander nodded. "I'm fine. Not drunk."

"That's good. Wait a moment!" She turned and went into her apartment, soon coming out with an envelope.

"An invitation for tomorrow's unveiling ceremony. Professor, feel free to come if you have time."

Alexander took it. "Good. I'll definitely be there."

"I'll head back then." Sophia pointed to her own door.

"Alright." He nodded with a smile.

The next second, he lost his balance, stumbling backward.

Sophia quickly reached out to steady him.

The girl moved closer, her fresh scent drifting into his nostrils. Alexander felt his cheeks grow hot, as if on fire.

Just a moment ago, he had confidently claimed he wasn't drunk.

Now, he wasn't so sure.

"...Professor? Professor?!"

"...Hmm? What?" Alexander snapped back to attention.

"Are you really not drunk? Drunk people always say they're not."

Sophia sighed softly. "Alright, never mind. It's not可信 anyway."

Alexander fell silent.

She held him with one hand while the other reached into his coat pocket for the keys.
###Chapter 321

Sophia Sullivan helped Alexander Laurent back to his apartment.

She only turned to leave after repeatedly confirming he was conscious and capable of taking care of himself.

Returning to her own home, she was sweating all over from the heat.

As she took off her padded jacket, a faint scent of alcohol wafted towards her.

Whether it was from their close proximity or the fabric absorbing the smell, the coat was saturated with his scent.

Her cheeks felt warm.
She fanned herself with her hand, muttering under her breath, "Why is it so hot…"

Under the same moonlight, at the Lawrence family residence.

The elderly couple was preparing to retire to their rooms when Marcus Lawrence suddenly spoke up.

"Grandma, Grandpa, please wait a moment."

"What is it, Marcus?" The grandmother turned back to ask.

Marcus looked serious.
"Grandma, this is for you.
You must attend tomorrow."

He didn't give it to his grandfather because the elder's current status wasn't suitable for public appearances anymore.

Unless it was a major occasion like a military parade or a disaster relief effort.

"...What is this?"

The moment she took the invitation, the grandmother's fingers trembled slightly.

Red... invitation... must attend tomorrow... and her grandson was being so solemn about it...

This!

"Marcus, don't do anything foolish.
Our family isn't some feudal household that interferes with the younger generation's marriages.
There's no need for you to act first and ask for forgiveness later... if there's a girl you like, would we really stop you?!"

Marcus: "?"

The grandfather's mouth twitched.
"What nonsense! I told you to watch fewer of those TV dramas.
You're always letting your imagination run wild!"

The grandmother looked bewildered.
"Did I guess wrong?"

The grandfather said, "Open it and look first!"

Only then did Marcus realize, both amused and exasperated.
"Grandma, this is an invitation, not a wedding announcement!"

The grandmother hesitantly opened it.
"An... invitation letter?"

So it was a misunderstanding.

"If it's an invitation, why use red... it's easy to misunderstand..."

She tried to save face while lowering her head to read the contents.

"Laboratory unveiling?" The grandmother looked puzzled.
"What laboratory?"

Marcus enunciated each word clearly.
"A laboratory we built ourselves."

"What? You built a laboratory?!"

"Yes."

The grandmother was stunned for a full half minute before barely processing this information.
"...Is this the big thing you mentioned?"

"Mmhmm!"

"But... you can't just build a laboratory on a whim, can you? What does it look like?"

Marcus said, "You'll see when you visit tomorrow."

He turned to his grandfather.
"Grandpa, Grandma will take photos for you live tomorrow."

"Alrighty."

"So you knew all along?" The grandmother suddenly turned her head.
"You kept it from me?"

The grandfather cleared his throat lightly.
"Well... it's getting late.
Time for bed!"

"?"

The next day was unexpectedly clear.
The soft sunlight spilled onto the earth, coating the snow on roofs and tree branches with a layer of pale gold.

The first to arrive were naturally their own people.

"Sweetie—hehe—"

Henry Lorenz, bundled in a thick down jacket, approached his daughter with his wife on his arm.

"Pops—"

Hannah Morse's eyes lit up as she threw herself into her father's arms.

"Weren't you supposed to arrive this afternoon?!"

Henry staggered from the impact, his chest aching, but he laughed happily.
"I tricked you! We arrived yesterday afternoon, wanted to surprise you!
Surprised?"

"Mmhmm! Super surprised!"

"Mom—" Hannah called out with a laugh, "You look so beautiful today.
Truly the universe's number one beautiful, rich lady!"

Although Brianna Lowell had wanted a son, her daughter was also dear to her heart.
And since she only had this one, she naturally doted on her.

She just sometimes got stuck in her own thoughts, overthinking things.

Brianna smiled, her eyes curving, and even struck a curvaceous pose.
"Of course~"

Her days were spent either collecting rent or researching skincare.
Of course she was young, beautiful, and fashionable.

Hannah's words hit right at her sweet spot.

"Come, Mom, Dad, let me introduce you.
These are my classmates, and also my comrades!"

Sophia Sullivan had been observing Henry since he appeared.

This was the lab's biggest benefactor.

It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say he paid for half the bricks and tiles here.

Sophia: "Hello, Uncle, Auntie."

Marcus: "Hello, Uncle.
Auntie, you look so young…"

Sophia couldn't help but glance at him out of the corner of her eye.

"Hey! Hello, hello!" Henry shook their hands warmly.
"Sophia! Little Marcus! Haha... I often hear my sweetie talk about you.
Finally get to meet you today!
Uncle doesn't have anything great, just a little token of appreciation—"

With that, he directly pulled two thick red envelopes from the inner lining of his down jacket.

He shoved one into each of their hands.

Before Sophia and Marcus could refuse, Mr. Lorenz waved a large hand.
"Don't say no.
You can't refuse a gift from your elders.
Take it, take it!"

The two exchanged a look.

"Thank you, Uncle."

"Hey~ that's more like it!"

Suddenly—

A booming voice rang out.
"Well! Guests are here already? I thought I'd be the earliest!"

Sophia went to greet him.
"Professor Murphy!"

Benjamin Murphy walked up to the lab's main entrance, looked up at the five-story building that had sprung from the ground, and was eager to go inside and explore.

But before that—

"I brought a few friends along.
You don't mind, do you, Sophia?"

As soon as he finished speaking, several cars pulled up.

Two minutes later, a group of elderly professors got out.

All in black down jackets, temples slightly gray, exuding an academic aura.

Sophia's eyes widened in surprise.
"This…"

He'd invited the entire Computer Science department's "old guard"!

Benjamin Murphy said, "We've lived most of our lives and have never seen a fully robot-controlled smart bio lab.
Came together today to broaden our horizons."

Sophia's eyes grew warm.

She knew Professor Murphy was bringing all his connections to back her up!

"Benjamin, how did you beat us here?" Eleanor Watson laughed as she got out of the car.

With her came the Chair and Vice-Chair of Caltech's Biology department, the molecular science authority Professor Wei from Tech, Vice Principal Pan from another prestigious university, Professor Wang from the Information School of a top youth academy…

Any one of these people pulled out at random was a heavyweight in the academic world.

And now, they had all gathered here!

Hannah was usually bold, but seeing this scene, she couldn't help but swallow.
"Soph—Sophia, are we… playing too big?"

Every single one of these people was a walking SCI publication, bona fide research giants.

"What? Scared?"

Hannah straightened her back.
"How could I be? The bigger the play, the more exciting it is.
I love this heart-pounding feeling—it's awesome!"

Not long after, Alexander Laurent and Sebastian Evans arrived one after the other.

Sebastian: "Well, Professor Laurent, we meet again.
You're really honoring us with your presence."

Alexander replied indifferently, "Naturally, I have to give Sophia face."

Their eyes met, then quickly separated.

Sparks flew in the air.

Next to arrive were MIT's President, Shawn Hanning, Vice Principal Charlie Wilson…

The two looked at the five-story building rising before them, their faces identical masks of shock and disbelief.

They… really built a lab?!

At eleven in the morning, Blake Cunningham and Professor Victoria Lowell arrived late.

Caleb Watson, Jude Granger, Amelia Roscente, Ashley Lowell, Shane Holloway, and Fiona Valentine followed closely behind.

"Are you sure this is the place?" Blake Cunningham frowned, looking around.
###Chapter 322

A brand new five-story building stood before them.

Its exterior walls were smooth and clean.

The glass panels were crystal clear.

The surrounding area, however, was barren and desolate.

In the distance, a construction site was still active.

Professor Victoria Lowell scoffed.

"Building a lab in a place like this? Sophia Sullivan certainly knows how to put on a show."

Blake Cunningham's initial anxiety completely dissipated.

It was just a cheap trick, after all.

"Let's go," Victoria said. "No point wasting our time."

They turned to get back into their cars.

A voice called out from the distance.

"Blake?" An elderly man smiled and waved.

Blake froze, then looked surprised. "Professor Zhou? What are you doing here?"

Professor Zhou Dingxian was a founding member of the Computer Science department.

He had long since retired.

Blake had been his student and later his colleague.

They had a close relationship.

They had just spoken on the phone last week.

Zhou had said he was vacationing in Hainan.

"Didn't you go south to escape the cold?"

Zhou chuckled. "I prefer Kyoto. Old Benjamin invited me to join the fun, so I came along."

"Fun?"

"The lab's unveiling ceremony."

Blake's heart tightened. "A student's foolishness shouldn't trouble you. How inconsiderate..."

He assumed Sophia had invited him.

He hadn't expected her to have such connections.

Zhou frowned. "Foolishness? The first fully autonomous, student-built smart bio-lab in the country. A first in MIT's history. How is that foolish?"

Blake was incredulous. "This barren land? A lab?"

A smart bio-lab, no less.

Such exaggerated claims!

"Barren land?" Zhou pointed at the building. "Five full floors. Fully equipped. State-of-the-art facilities. Almost all imported..."

His tone held a hint of envy by the end.

He had never worked in such a well-equipped lab himself.

Blake was stunned. "Sophia Sullivan built this?"

"Of course. The front is even livelier. Just walk around from here to see."

Zhou, full of curiosity about the lab, had explored the interior and then wandered to the back looking for more surprises.

That's when he ran into Blake and his group.

Blake walked around to the front entrance in a daze.

The noise of a crowd filled the air.

Congratulations could be heard everywhere.

Victoria's jaw dropped in astonishment.

She blinked hard.

It was all real.

Sophia had actually built a laboratory.

How was this possible?

Shane Holloway was completely dumbfounded.

The prepared taunts stuck in his throat.

Not a single word could come out.

Amelia Roscente's eyes widened in shock.

She suddenly remembered Sophia's words—

What goes around comes around...

Ashley Lowell panicked and grabbed Victoria's arm. "Auntie, what do we do? If the President finds out about what we did..."

"Shut up!" Victoria snapped sharply. "We did nothing! Watch your mouth!"

Jude Granger and Caleb Watson were carefully examining the building.

The more they looked, the more excited they became.

"Caleb, five floors... how big must it be?"

Caleb stood with his arms crossed, pure admiration in his eyes.

This was so like Sophia.

Go big or go home.

"Let's go in and find out."

Jude's eyes lit up. "But we don't have invitations..."

They had come using Blake's invitation.

Caleb smiled slightly. "Says who?"

He opened his jacket, revealing a corner of red paper in an inner pocket.

Jude was shocked. "Caleb, you—"

"Shh. Keep it down."

Jude suppressed his excitement, his heart pounding.

"Sophia gave it to you?"

"Yeah."

"You're close?"

Caleb thought for a moment. "Not really."

"Then why—"

"Maybe... she wanted us to see the show?"

Just then—

Professor Eleanor Watson approached with a smile. "Dean Blake, what an unexpected honor!"

Blake forced a smile. "You flatter me. In the presence of such esteemed seniors, I dare not claim to be an 'honor'."

He glanced around and gasped.

The Head of Biology from Caltech.

A renowned luminary from the tech institute.

The Vice-President of another major university.

A professor from a prestigious academy...

Half the academic elite had gathered here!

He was insignificant compared to these people.

Eleanor pretended not to notice his discomfort. "I don't recall sending an invitation to Dean Blake? Sophia, come here—"

Sophia stepped forward. "Professor?"

"Dean Blake specially brought Professor Lowell and students to offer congratulations. But I'm sure I didn't invite Dean Blake?"

"No, you didn't," Sophia nodded. "When we sent the invitation to the President, we included one for Vice-Dean Blake. Perhaps the Dean didn't wish to come, so the invitation went to the Vice-Dean instead?"

"I see," Eleanor said, as if suddenly understanding. "I thought Dean Blake had come to watch the spectacle."

Their back-and-forth made Blake break out in a cold sweat.

He could only offer an apologetic smile. "I wouldn't dare..."

All his earlier arrogance had vanished.

Eleanor said "make yourselves at home" and took Sophia to greet other professors.

Blake was completely ignored.

Victoria was even more overlooked.

Blake suddenly remembered something, his face changing dramatically.

He hurriedly pulled out his phone—

"Tyler! Stop the reporters from the Campus News! Send them back immediately!"

On the other end, Tyler was startled. "Dean Blake, what's wrong?"

"Don't ask questions, just do it!"

"But... but... it's too late!"

Blake stood frozen on the spot.
###Chapter 323

The words had barely left her mouth.

Reporters and a photographer from the Campus Gazette appeared on the scene.

"Hello everyone, we're from the Campus Gazette. We'd like to conduct a quick on-site interview. Is that alright?"

Sophia Sullivan and Professor Eleanor Watson exchanged a glance.

"Of course," Sophia said with a smile. "But may I ask who invited you?"

"Dean Blake Cunningham from the School of Life Sciences. He said students built their own lab and even invited the President to the unveiling. Very newsworthy."

"The Dean is too kind."

Blake Cunningham, not far away, wished the ground would swallow him whole.

The reporter asked a few questions about the laboratory.

Then, abruptly, he changed the subject.

"...Is the President not here yet?"

No sooner had he spoken.

Xiao Ninghan and Charlie Wilson arrived.

"Eleanor, congratulations." Xiao Ninghan got out of the car, smiling and cupping his hands in a gesture of respect.

That single gesture alone spoke volumes about his high emotional intelligence.

Charlie Wilson was not nearly as composed.

He was first stunned by the five-story building.

Then shocked by the lineup of distinguished guests.

By the time he collected himself.

Xiao Ninghan was already speaking with Sophia.

"Truly a student of Eleanor Watson's. The new generation surpasses the old. As President, nothing makes me happier than seeing students grow and the future of academia secured!"

"I heard you single-handedly set up this lab, Miss Sullivan. You are remarkable."

Xiao Ninghan gave a thumbs-up.

But Sophia pulled Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence forward.

"President, that's not entirely accurate. The three of us built this lab together. So the remarkable ones are us."

"Haha... Right! It's all of you!"

Hannah and Marcus were completely dumbfounded.

Sophia had moved too fast.

They hadn't processed it.

Only after Xiao Ninghan and Charlie Wilson moved away did Hannah snap out of it.

"Sophia... did the President just... praise me?"

"Yes."

"Oh my god, I wouldn't even dream of this."

It was Xiao Ninghan!

The head of MIT!

The internet-famous President!

And he had praised her?

"Marcus, quick, hold me up. My legs are jelly."

Marcus's mouth twitched.

"Really?"

Even as he said it, his hand reached out to steady her.

...She was surprisingly heavy.

"Yes! Absolutely yes!" Hannah gazed at Sophia with shining eyes. "Sophia, you're the best..."

She hadn't forgotten to include them, even at a moment like this.

Sophia shrugged.

"I just told the truth."

Marcus also shot her a look of gratitude.

As Xiao Ninghan passed Blake Cunningham.

Cunningham nearly bent his waist at a ninety-degree angle.

His head practically buried in the ground.

Xiao Ninghan walked straight past without a glance.

Cunningham just began to relax.

The next second—

Xiao Ninghan turned back.

He stopped in front of him.

"School of Life Sciences? Blake Cunningham?"

"Y-yes! President!" His heart, just settled, leapt back into his throat.

He was on the verge of tears.

If he'd known Sophia could actually build a lab.

And invite so many academic heavyweights.

He never would have come!

And bringing the Campus Gazette reporters and photographer...

Cunningham desperately wanted to slap himself.

The regret!

Xiao Ninghan looked him up and down.

He seemed oblivious to the other man's discomfort.

He spoke calmly.

"I heard Sophia Sullivan's group built this lab off-campus because their on-campus lab was required to undergo fire safety renovations?"

At the words "fire safety renovations," Cunningham's heart skipped a beat.

Victoria Lowell behind him also felt her scalp prickle.

Shane Holloway, Ashley Lowell, and Amelia Roscente instantly turned into quailing quails.

They didn't dare breathe too loudly.

Cunningham forced himself to answer.

"Y-yes, that's correct..."

"Was there something particular about the circumstances?"

"Th-this..." Cunningham's eyes darted around. "I'm not too familiar with the details. It requires further investigation..."

"Not familiar?" Xiao Ninghan's tone was cool. "As the Dean, you're not familiar with the only lab in the entire school ordered to undergo renovations? Who communicated with the district fire department? Who signed off on the renovation plan? Was the situation properly communicated? How was it explained to the students involved... Aren't these things you should have overseen?"

With every sentence Xiao Ninghan uttered.

Cunningham's head drooped lower.

Finally.

He was bent over facing the ground.

As if in apology.

Charlie Wilson, never one to miss a chance to stir the pot, spoke up languidly.

"Judging by Dean Cunningham's reaction, there seems to be more to this story?"

Xiao Ninghan's gaze sharpened.

"Since there seems to be more to it, submit a written report. Furthermore, Professor Watson deserves an explanation. Her students were essentially thrown out and ended up spending their own money to build a lab."

"Those who don't know might praise MIT students for being exceptional. Those who do know will say the nation's top university can't even provide a proper lab!"

"The School of Life Sciences receives national funding, university funding. Not much academic output, but incident after incident. Some people have grown too comfortable. The rot starts from the root."

Xiao Ninghan finished and walked away.

Cunningham was drenched in a cold sweat.

He could barely straighten his back.

"Dean Cunningham..." Victoria Lowell ventured tentatively.

Cunningham whirled around.

He glared at her viciously.

"Fools! Fools! Who told you to make trouble for Sophia Sullivan, to deny her a lab?!"

"You already did this once with the CPRT equipment! You dared to do it again with the fire inspection?! Where did you get the nerve?!"

Victoria was stunned by the outburst.

Coming to her senses and realizing students were present, she flushed with humiliation.

But the more pressing matter was—

"What did the President mean just now? Did he notice something? Did Eleanor Watson complain?!"

She was frantic.

She wanted some reassurance from Cunningham.

But Cunningham had his own problems.

He was in no mood to soothe her!

"What do you think?! The mess you made will be dug up sooner or later!"

That offhand remark.

Nearly scared Victoria out of her wits.

No... This can't happen...

She couldn't just wait for doom!

Suddenly.

She remembered something.

She turned sharply towards Sophia.

She plastered on a smile and walked over.

"Miss Sullivan, you're truly impressive! Building a lab just like that! I just wonder, did it pass the relevant official inspections?"
###Chapter 324

Professor Victoria Lowell  suddenly spoke.

All eyes instantly focused on her.

Bai Jiangbo's face darkened. "What are you trying to do?!" He reached out to grab her.

Professor Victoria Lowell  shook off his hand.

She walked directly up to Sophia Sullivan. "Why aren't you answering? Feeling guilty?"

"This laboratory of yours has no legal permits. It was built in violation of regulations!"

Sophia Sullivan gave a light laugh.

Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence also exchanged a smile.

Professor Victoria Lowell  immediately panicked. "What are you laughing at?!"

Hannah Morse stepped forward. "Sophia anticipated someone would cause trouble. All the permits are in order. Which document would you like to see, Professor Xu? I'll fetch it for you now."

"According to the latest regulations, a BSL-3 lab must be approved by the National Environmental Protection Agency. Did you obtain the permit?"

Professor Victoria Lowell  lifted her chin.

This regulation was only introduced last year, and the approval process was extremely strict.

Professor Lin from Caltech had been applying for six months without success.

How could Sophia Sullivan's team possibly have gotten the permit in just two months?

"Hannah," Sophia said.

Hannah immediately walked into the lab and soon returned with a file folder.

"Show Professor Xu properly, so no one can spread rumors."

Hannah smiled as she handed it over. "You should look very carefully."

Professor Victoria Lowell  took the folder, her fingers trembling slightly.

She pulled out the documents.

Half a minute later—

"Impossible! This must be forged!"

Hannah snatched the file back. "Some people are just blind, refusing to recognize the real thing even when it's right in front of them."

Sophia's gaze turned cold. "Professor Xu, this isn't the first time."

"From the CPRT Dynamometer to the fire safety rectification, and now openly slandering us."

"Three strikes. We won't tolerate it anymore."

Sophia succinctly exposed their past grievances.

Bai Jiangbo inwardly cursed. Professor Victoria Lowell  had walked right into a trap.

Just then, a bus pulled up.

The doors opened, and a swarm of reporters rushed out.

Education Channel, Academic Daily, Science Weekly...

All were authoritative media outlets.

Even a reporter from Kyoto News was there.

Bai Jiangbo stared, dumbfounded. "Wh-What is this?"

Sophia looked at Hannah and Marcus.

They both shook their heads.

They hadn't invited them.

The reporters quickly surrounded Professor Victoria Lowell .

Microphones were thrust in her face.

"Can you explain the CPRT incident?"

"What happened with the fire safety rectification?"

"Is this academic suppression?"

"Are you deliberately targeting these students?"

The questions grew increasingly sharp.

Trapped in the middle, Professor Victoria Lowell  turned pale.

"St-Stop filming..." she stammered incoherently.

Ashley Lowell tried to push through to help her.

But she was blocked by the reporters.

She cried in frustration. "I'm sorry... I didn't mean to... Auntie..."

Bai Jiangbo grabbed her arm. "What did you just say?! What did you do?!"

Ashley trembled with fear. "I... I sent a tip to the media..."

She had only wanted to get some reporters to expose the situation.

She never expected so many legitimate media outlets to show up.

She certainly never expected Sophia Sullivan to have actually built the lab properly.

Bai Jiangbo roared, "Who told you to take matters into your own hands?!"

Tears streamed down Ashley's face. "Didn't you say the more commotion the better?"

Bai Jiangbo was rendered speechless.

Whispers rose around them.

"So there's more to the story."

"The students were pushed to this point. The school has serious problems."

"MIT really needs an overhaul."

Xiao Ninghan and Charlie Wilson looked furious.

This farce was a massive loss of face for them.

Xiao Ninghan shot a cold glare at Bai Jiangbo. "Haven't you embarrassed us enough?!"

Bai Jiangbo finally snapped out of it and hurriedly ushered Professor Victoria Lowell  and the students away.

Jude Granger looked at Caleb Watson. "Brother, should we leave?"

Caleb Watson shook his head. "Don't you want to go inside and see?"

Jude Granger's eyes lit up. "Yes!"

At that moment, a celebratory cannon suddenly fired.

Floral baskets were carried one by one to the lab's entrance.

Drones performed a formation in the sky.

They finally assembled into a line of large characters—

Congratulations on the completion of the lab!

Sophia looked at Alexander Laurent and Sebastian Evans.

Alexander wouldn't do something like this.

That left only...

Sebastian Evans met her gaze.

His lips moved silently.

He said: Like it?
###Chapter 325

The Boundaryless Lab!

Everyone present was stunned by the magnificent sight.

They all looked up in awe.

Exclamations of wonder rose and fell around them.

Sophia Sullivan thought for a moment, then walked toward Sebastian Evans.

Noticing her approach, a flicker of surprise passed through Sebastian's eyes.

"Thank you," Sophia said, stopping before him with sincere gratitude. "Were those journalists also arranged by you?"

"Blake Cunningham contacted two media outlets," Sebastian explained. "He originally intended to blow things out of proportion and shift blame onto the university administration. I merely redirected the current, amplifying the momentum to ensure the counterblow would be all the more resounding."

Sebastian held back another layer of his reasoning.

He had warned Blake Cunningham multiple times before, but his warnings were ignored.

Under those circumstances, he couldn't be blamed for his severe response.

Some people only learn through harsh lessons.

If they still don't learn after being struck, it means they weren't struck hard enough.

Nearby, Professor Benjamin Murphy clapped while nudging Professor Eleanor Watson's shoulder. "Feeling reassured now? Our little Sophia isn't some pushover. She said she'd build a lab, and she did. I was truly shocked when I received the invitation!"

Professor Eleanor Watson nodded with relief. "Sophia is indeed decisive and knows how to fight back…"

She sighed softly. "She's much stronger than I am."

Hearing the self-reproach in her tone, Professor Murphy laughed heartily. "No matter how strong she is, she's still a student we mentored. A mighty leader commands strong troops—we're not so bad ourselves!"

Professor Watson shot him a look. "I don't share your thick skin."

The performance concluded right on time.

Sophia invited Professor Watson to inscribe the lab's name.

Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence brought out a table and set up ink, brush, paper, and inkstone.

Professor Watson stood before the table, pondered for a moment, then wielded the brush with flowing strokes:

Scientific research is vast, exploration knows no bounds.

Thus, the lab was named—

The Boundaryless Lab!

…

Blake Cunningham left with Professor Victoria Lowell.

Aside from Caleb Watson who stayed, Fiona Valentine also remained.

Since her arrival, she hadn't uttered a single sarcastic word.

Despite Blake and Professor Lowell's constant pessimism, Fiona had stayed silent throughout.

She glanced at the man beside her, her tone laced with regret and chagrin. "I never imagined Professor Lowell would be such a person…"

Yes, Ethan Roscente had come.

He arrived incidentally as Fiona Valentine's boyfriend.

He lacked Alexander Laurent's prestige in academic circles, nor had he contributed significantly to the lab's establishment like Sebastian Evans.

He hadn't even received an invitation from Sophia.

When he signed the informed consent form, he had asked her to send him an invitation for the lab's opening.

But she… truly seemed unwilling to see him again.

She couldn't even be bothered with superficial courtesy.

Sophia didn't want to see him, yet he couldn't stop himself from coming.

Perhaps he wanted to witness her success, or see her proud and triumphant.

In any case, he saw it—

Sophia, surrounded by well-wishers, her smile radiant, vibrant with life.

Her confident composure while introducing the lab on stage, her articulate ease while mingling with guests—she shone as brilliantly as the sun.

Ethan was reminded of her university days, equally confident, graceful, and dazzling.

He had fallen for her at first sight.

But after they got together, especially during the years the company went public, she was confined at home. 
###Chapter 326

Her smile gradually turned bitter, her vitality slowly faded.

It was only after leaving him that she rediscovered her purpose and regained her former brilliance.

Realizing he had ultimately lost this woman, the infatuation in Ethan's eyes was replaced by profound regret.

Fiona, observing the man's changing expressions, remained composed. She proactively linked her arm with his.

Ethan looked at her, puzzled.

Fiona smiled. "Since we came to offer congratulations and brought a gift, it's only polite to present it to the host personally."

With that, she led Ethan forward. "Sophia, congratulations! We weren't sure what you'd like. This gift is from both Ethan and me. We wish your lab abundant achievements and a fruitful harvest."

"Thank you." Not one to reject a friendly gesture, Sophia calmly accepted the gift. Her gaze remained fixed on Fiona, not sparing Ethan a single glance.

Ethan's hand, hanging at his side, clenched into a tight fist.

Caleb and Jude Granger seized the opportunity to step forward and offer their congratulations.

Caleb, clutching his item, wasn't as eloquent as Fiona. He awkwardly presented his gift. "Congratulations. These are sachets. Not valuable. My mother made them. They can refresh your mind and repel insects and mosquitoes."

There were three sachets in total.

Not just for Sophia; Hannah and Marcus each received one too.

As he handed them out, he was nervous, worried the gifts were too shabby. He couldn't afford anything expensive.

Unexpectedly, Sophia and her two friends showed no disdain. They actually liked them.

Hannah held hers, examining it curiously.

The sachets contained mugwort and other herbal spices. The initial scent was strong, but the refreshing effect was excellent.

After smelling it for a while, the fragrance mellowed, becoming rounded and harmonious.

It was amazing!

A simple herbal sachet even had top and base notes.

"Thank you, we all really like this gift," Sophia said, carefully examining the sachet. She noticed the embroidery on the outside was hand-stitched.

Hers featured a white cat, Hannah's a golden cicada, and Marcus's three stalks of wheat.

To express their thanks, Hannah personally poured a glass of water for Caleb. "I never properly thanked you for helping me pick up my things last time. Now we've received your gifts. Let me at least pour you a glass of water!"

Caleb waved his hands hurriedly, his cheeks flushing. "N-no need to be so polite. They're not valuable…"

"It's the thought that counts," Hannah said.

Caleb's face turned even redder.

To ease his embarrassment, he coughed lightly. "...Would it be possible to tour your lab?"

Marcus, having safely stored his sachet, stepped forward to lead the way. "I'll show you around."

"Thank you."

…

Marcus led the two men, explaining as they walked, occasionally demonstrating how to use the smart systems himself.

The expressions on Caleb and Jude's faces shifted from shock to utter disbelief.

A private, independent laboratory…

Just the name alone was thrilling.

The further they went, the more they saw, and the greater the excitement in their eyes became.

The lab benches were equipped with various precision instruments. The date labels indicated they were all updated within the last two years. Some, Caleb recognized, he had only ever seen in scientific journals.

If his memory served him correctly, a single one of those instruments cost at least a hundred thousand US dollars. And in this lab, with just a quick glance, he spotted three of them!
The lounge door swung open.

Sophia Sullivan's meticulously designed space was revealed.

Eight private suites stood in neat rows.

Each suite featured a comfortable bed and a spacious wardrobe.

Full-length mirrors and washbasins were fully equipped.

The common area was designed to be warm and practical.

The coffee station emitted a rich aroma.

Bookshelves were filled with various genres.

A swing gently swayed.

A ping pong table stood ready for use.

Pots and pans were neatly arranged in the small kitchen.

A smart system completely separated this area from the lab zone.

Jude Granger couldn't hold back his amazement. "Is this a lab? It feels like a resort!"

Marcus Lawrence smiled faintly. "Hannah said the same thing."

"And hot showers too? We can just stay overnight after pulling all-nighters for experiments. So convenient." Jude touched the doorframe, his eyes full of envy.

Caleb Watson also showed a longing expression.

Marcus noticed his look. "Sometimes resistance is easier than endurance. Many just don't dare to try."

Caleb was silent for a moment. "What if we fail?"

The corner of Marcus's mouth lifted slightly. "Nothing in this world is guaranteed. If you fail, just start over. As long as you're still here, there's nothing to fear."

Caleb fell into thought again.

Jude, completely oblivious to their conversation, looked around curiously.

...

The unveiling ceremony finally concluded.

After seeing off the last guest, the three of them could finally catch their breath.

Hannah Morse rubbed her calves complaining. "Standing for so long, my legs are about to give out."

Marcus collapsed onto the sofa. "Finally done."

Sophia Sullivan remained standing by the bookshelf. "Marcus, were the reporters all taken care of?"

Marcus sat up straight. "My grandmother personally handled it. She used to work in the press office and is very experienced with these matters."

"Good." Sophia nodded. "There's something else I need to tell you."

"What is it?" Seeing her serious expression, they both paid close attention.

Sophia lowered her voice. "Professor Eleanor Watson just told me our future academic achievements will be credited to the Boundless Lab, separate from the School."

"What does that mean?" Hannah's eyes widened.

Marcus understood immediately. "A complete separation from the School?"

Sophia nodded affirmatively. "You could put it that way."

Hannah frowned. "Would the School agree? They're not stupid."

"The Professor said she'll handle it. We just need to focus on our research."

"Amazing! So we're basically working for ourselves now!" Hannah happily stuffed a biscuit into her mouth.

So delicious.

"It would be perfect if we had some hot bubble tea right now..."

Before she finished speaking, Sophia's phone rang.

"Hello?"

"Lytuan delivery. Please come out to get your bubble tea. I can't get in."

Sophia was stunned.

Bubble tea?

She didn't order any.

The delivery guy urged again, so she went to retrieve it.

Three cups of hot bubble tea, from their usual shop.

Hannah cheered. "Sophia, you're so thoughtful!"

Sophia shook her head. "It wasn't me."

Hannah paused. "Marcus, was it you?"

Marcus immediately denied it. "Not me."

"Then who was it?"

Alexander Laurent entered from outside just then. Seeing the bubble tea, he raised an eyebrow slightly. "The delivery arrived already?"

Hannah was surprised. "Professor, did you order this?"

Alexander nodded faintly. "I didn't know your preferences, so I ordered the same for everyone."

Hannah praised repeatedly. "It's delicious!"

Just then, Sophia's phone rang again.

"...Okay, coming right away."

Three minutes later, she came back in carrying another bag of bubble tea.

Hannah was dumbfounded. "Another three cups?"

Alexander shook his head, indicating he didn't know.

"Then who ordered these..."

"Did the bubble tea arrive?" Sebastian Evans walked in smiling, but his smile soon froze.

He noticed the cups in their hands weren't from his order.

His gaze swept over Alexander, finally landing on Sophia.

"Looks like I'm a step too late?"

The air suddenly grew quiet.

Hannah and Marcus exchanged glances.

Hannah: What's going on?

Marcus: No idea.

Hannah: Seems tense?

Marcus: Agreed.

"Great!" Hannah quickly tried to smooth things over. "Professor Laurent and Mr. Evans both ordered bubble tea. Thank you both!"

She took the bubble tea Sebastian ordered. "Perfect, I can have two cups!"

Marcus also picked up a cup. "Thank you, Mr. Evans."

Alexander looked at Sophia. "Sophia probably can't drink two cups, right?"

Two cups of bubble tea now sat in front of Sophia.

Sebastian smiled. "I ordered the hot kind."

Alexander replied casually. "What a coincidence. So did I."

Sebastian: "I chose Sophia's favorite flavor."

Alexander: "She won't dislike what I chose either."

Sebastian: "Low sugar, milk tea base swapped for a tea base. Healthier."

Alexander: "Another coincidence. I did the same."

They both looked at Sophia.

So—

Which one will she choose?
###Chapter 327

Hannah Morse stood to the side, blinking.

She didn't dare make a sound.

This scene...

Tsk.

Sophia Sullivan's gaze shifted between the two men.

Sebastian Evans' peach-blossom eyes held a smile, appearing casual yet undeniably forceful.

He would not take no for an answer.

Alexander Laurent was much calmer, his gaze gentle.

Sophia understood. It was acceptance and encouragement.

Like the ocean accepting all rivers, nourishing silently.

Both were waiting for her answer.

Sophia was silent for a moment.

Suddenly, she noticed something and stood up, walking to the water dispenser.

She opened the cabinet above and retrieved a mug.

"I think water is better."

Alexander Laurent and Sebastian Evans' eyes met, then they each looked away.

Sebastian smiled carelessly.

"You've had a tiring morning. Get some rest. I should head back to the office."

Work was waiting for him. Taking the entire morning off was already pushing it.

"Alright, I'll see you out."

A hint of pleasure appeared at the corners of Sebastian's eyes.

"Sure."

He shot Alexander a challenging look.

Sophia walked him to his car.

Before he left, she thanked him sincerely again.

Sebastian detected the apology in her tone and gave a faint smile.

"Everything I do, I do willingly. Don't feel pressured. Between friends, too much politeness creates distance."

Sophia paused, then said nothing more.

She watched Sebastian drive away.

Turning around, she found Alexander standing under the eaves.

The man was tall and stood with perfect posture.

His calm gaze was fixed on her, clearly waiting for her to turn back.

For some inexplicable reason, Sophia suddenly felt a pang of guilt.

But then she thought, what did she have to feel guilty about?

Before she could trace the source of this emotion, Alexander was already in front of her.

"The lab is newly established. It attracted significant attention today. Your every move might be scrutinized now. At a time like this, a single misstep could lead to trouble..."

He stopped mid-sentence, noticing her slightly dazed expression, and wondered if he had been too stern.

As he considered how to lighten the mood, Sophia had already processed his words.

She nodded seriously and spoke with gravity.

"Thank you for the reminder, Professor. I understand. Everything has two sides. Building our own lab seems glamorous, but it's also like being cooked over a high flame."

The results could go either way—

It could bring honor, or it could be a case of "uneasy lies the head that wears a crown"...

Hearing her words, Alexander couldn't help but laugh softly.

Why did he think his seriousness would intimidate her?

She was more clear-headed and far-sighted than he had imagined.

Alexander's tone softened.

"Your capabilities are beyond doubt. But I want to say, if you encounter any difficulties, you can always come to me... or Professor Eleanor Watson. You don't have to shoulder everything alone. We will always be your strong support."

Sophia's heart stirred, her eyes flickering slightly.

She lowered her gaze and gave a soft "Mm."

...

Meanwhile, Ethan Roscente and Fiona Valentine had long since left with the other guests.

In the car, the driver gripped the steering wheel nervously, breathing cautiously.

The two in the back seat did not speak, the atmosphere eerily quiet.

Fiona looked at Ethan.

Since getting in the car, he had been staring out the window, silent, his expression detached.

Fiona smiled, her gentle voice breaking the silence.

"Sophia is truly remarkable. To find a way out of such a difficult situation and checkmate Professor Victoria Lowell and Dean Blake Cunningham so decisively... impressive! No wonder Professor Eleanor Watson values her so highly."

Her words weren't empty praise; Fiona genuinely admired Sophia.

How many people had the courage to build their own lab like Sophia?

She certainly couldn't do it herself.

Ethan didn't speak, but the slight uplift at the corners of his eyes showed he was pleased to hear this praise.

Even proud, by association.

Fiona continued casually.

"Half the big names in the research world were there today. I had no idea she had such connections. Not to mention how effortlessly she held her own among all those luminaries. If it were me, I'd be a nervous wreck..."
###Chapter 328
Playing It Safe?

"That's just how she is. The more pressure she's under, the calmer she gets," Ethan Roscente said suddenly.

Fiona Valentine's lips curved slightly. "During the tour earlier, I noticed the lab wasn't just designed with workspaces. There's a lounge area, and they even included a kitchen…"

Ethan's gaze flickered. He spoke a few more words without thinking. "Because Sophia enjoys cooking. She has a real talent for it. Whenever she tries a dish she likes at a restaurant, she'll spend days figuring out how to make it. If a recipe and a video tutorial don't match up, she'll make both versions to see which one tastes better…"

"She must be very meticulous," Fiona remarked.

A faint smile touched Ethan's lips. His eyes grew distant with memory. "Yes. She's not just meticulous, but incredibly thoughtful too. She's always the first to notice if someone isn't feeling well… She knows where every single thing in the house is, down to the smallest decorative item or dish…"

"The medicine cabinet is impeccably organized by her. Fever reducers, anti-inflammatories, stomach medicine, cough syrup… you name it, it's there."

Fiona watched the man, a smile on his lips as he lost himself in the past. She unconsciously bit her lower lip.

"It sounds like… you had a wonderful past together…"

Ethan seemed not to hear her. He continued softly, "...She's neat, likes the slippers lined up perfectly. I'm more casual, not big on tidying. We argued about it a lot. But she always found a way to make me apologize. Sometimes with logic, sometimes by being coy, sometimes by just launching herself at me to shut me up…"

The light in his eyes grew brighter, but his voice cut off abruptly.

The sweetness of those memories constantly reminded him of what he had lost.

The flood of recollection brought a surge of regret with it.

Ethan felt a tightness in his chest, almost suffocating.

He looked up sharply and met Fiona's inquisitive gaze. He snapped back to reality.

Realizing he had said too much, he immediately fell silent.

Fiona watched as the man withdrew from his memories, rebuilding his defenses, transforming back into the unapproachable Mr. Roscente.

"...My apologies."

"Why are you apologizing?" Fiona asked.

"For talking too much."

"It's fine. I'm happy to listen, as long as you're willing to talk."

Ethan was silent for a moment before changing the subject. "Thank you for today."

"We agreed I'd help you reconcile with Sophia Sullivan. The lab unveiling was a chance to meet, but… it doesn't seem to have had much effect?"

Ethan lowered his gaze, his profile stern.

"Even if it didn't work—" Fiona's tone shifted, becoming playful, "I still put in the effort. Is a simple 'thank you' really enough?"

Ethan looked up. "I'll have my assistant transfer—" the money to you.

"I don't want money."

He frowned.

Fiona sighed softly. "You've already given me more than enough. I should be the one saying thank you. How about a meal this time? I skipped lunch, and I'm absolutely starving now."

Ethan was puzzled. "With money, you can get anything to eat."

"It's not the same!" Fiona insisted. "Right now, I can hitch a ride with you straight to a restaurant. If I take the money, I have to figure out what to eat, where to go, how to get there… It's a hassle!"

Ethan didn't understand, but he respected her choice. "Alright. But think it through. A meal versus a sum of money. The latter is worth more."

"I've thought about it. I want the meal!"

Ethan instructed the driver, "Turn around. Head to The Galleria."

"Right away, Mr. Roscente."

…

The meal proceeded pleasantly enough, largely due to the relaxed atmosphere Fiona deliberately cultivated.

During it, however, Ethan ordered a bottle of red wine.

By the time the bottle was empty, he was long past his limit, his eyes glazed over.

Seeing his state, Fiona had no choice but to help him into the car first.

The driver looked surprised. "Mr. Roscente, he's…"

"He had too much to drink. Please take him home," Fiona said.

The driver suddenly spoke up. "Will you be accompanying him, Ms. Valentine?"

Fiona was taken aback.

"Don't misunderstand," the driver quickly added. "Martha has already clocked out for the day. The mansion is empty. Mr. Roscente will need someone to look after him in this state. If you don't mind…"

"Of course I don't mind. Let's go," Fiona said.

With that, she got into the car as well.

Soon, the driver dropped them off and left.

Fiona helped Ethan inside. Just as the driver said, the house was dark and completely empty.

She settled him on the living room sofa and finally let out a breath of relief.

The man seemed restless in his sleep, eyes closed, brow tightly furrowed.

Seeing his discomfort, Fiona helped him out of his jacket and undid the top buttons of his shirt.

This seemed to make him more comfortable.

His brow gradually relaxed.

Fiona checked the time. It was almost ten. She went into the kitchen. After some soft noises, she came out with a glass of warm water and placed it on the coffee table.

Then, she fetched a pillow and gently placed it under his head.

Finally, she felt Ethan's forehead to confirm he didn't have a fever before quietly taking her leave.

The sound of the door closing was unusually clear in the silent night.

The moment she left, the man on the sofa opened his eyes.

That's right. Ethan wasn't drunk at all.

He had done this to test Fiona.

When she said she didn't want money, his guard shot up immediately.

A woman who doesn't want money only wants something more.

Like feelings?

Or perhaps, marriage or status?

This kind of test might seem excessive, but Ethan felt it necessary.

He didn't want to get entangled with another Isabella Langley.

At least for now, Fiona seemed to be playing it safe.

…

MIT, School of Life Sciences, Deputy Dean's office.

Blake Cunningham looked expressionlessly at the woman before him.

Overnight, Victoria Lowell had gained a haggard look.

Her eyes were half-lowered, none of her usual arrogance remaining.

"...Deputy Dean Cunningham, what did the President say?"

Blake's voice was cold. "You have the nerve to ask?! At an event like yesterday's, in front of so many colleagues and reporters, you actually rushed up to confront Sophia Sullivan! Were you afraid people wouldn't know you were the one behind all the trouble?!"

"I… I didn't think she'd actually gotten the approval…"

"You didn't think?! Did you think they could actually build that lab? And what was the result? Not only did they build it, but everyone came to celebrate! That's when you should have been cautious! You should have realized Sophia Sullivan and her team weren't bluffing; they have real capability!"

"But what did you do? You kept being foolish! You kept causing trouble! You kept making problems for me! Now you've messed up so badly the President knows about it. Something that could have been swept under the rug is now public knowledge. There's no protecting you now!"

Victoria's expression tightened. "What do you mean? What did the administration say?"
###Chapter 329

A cold smirk curled at the corner of Blake Cunningham's lips.

"Do you think this can be easily brushed aside?"

He grabbed the documents from his desk and flung them at her.

The papers grazed Victoria Lowell's cheek.

She bent down to pick them up.

Her fingers trembled violently the moment they touched the pages.

A disciplinary reprimand…

A fifty percent cut in research funding…

Disqualification from applying for national-level projects next year…

Each line hit her heart like a sledgehammer.

Victoria nearly had to lean against the wall to steady herself as she left the Dean's office.

Blake wasn't faring any better.

Even though he had pinned all the blame on Victoria.

The university still gave him a formal warning for managerial negligence.

It was valid for six months.

The faculty leadership spoke to him immediately.

On the surface, they suggested he take a leave for rest and recuperation.

In reality, it was a temporary suspension of his administrative power.

In six months, everything would have changed.

Blake slammed his fist on the desk.

He never would have worked with her if he'd known Victoria was this foolish.

Now it was all ruined.

...

"Auntie! What did Dean Cunningham say? We won't be implicated, right?"

Ashley Lowell had been waiting anxiously outside the office and rushed up to her.

Slap—

A sharp crack echoed through the hallway.

Ashley covered her cheek, stunned.

"A-Auntie?"

"Were those media outlets yesterday called by you?"

Ashley's eyes darted nervously as she swallowed.

"Dean Cunningham said making a big scene was better… I only contacted two outlets…"

"Two?" Victoria's eyes narrowed sharply. "Are you sure?"

"I swear! It was only two! I don't know why over a dozen showed up…"

"We've been played."

"You mean Sophia Sullivan…"

"Who else? She staged this entire show herself!"

Ashley hastily raised her hand to swear. "I really only contacted two!"

Victoria let out a cold laugh.

The hunter finally hunted by the goose.

Well played, Sophia Sullivan!

Well played, Eleanor Watson!

"Auntie…" Ashley ventured cautiously, "Will the university punish us?"

Victoria gave her a cold glance. "You're expelled."

Ashley's face instantly lost all color.

She swayed, nearly collapsing.

Seeing her thoroughly frightened, Victoria felt a sliver of satisfaction. "I was joking."

Ashley stared, bewildered.

"See for yourself." Victoria tossed the document to her.

Ashley quickly scanned it and found her name wasn't listed.

She immediately breathed a sigh of relief.

"Don't celebrate too soon." Victoria sneered. "If I go down, you're coming with me!"

"Auntie, how could I think that! We're on the same side!"

"You'd better remember that!"

Ashley's phone suddenly rang.

She answered it.

Her face grew paler and paler.

"A surprise inspection?! Okay… I'll be right there!"

Hanging up, she looked at Victoria, trembling.

"Auntie… something's happened…"

When they arrived at the lab, the fire safety inspectors were just leaving.

Shane Holloway ran over in a panic.

"Professor… both labs were issued rectification orders…"

It was the same scene all over again.

Only this time, they were the main characters.

Victoria couldn't believe her eyes.

But the black-and-white rectification orders were right in front of her.

"Why another inspection? And why only our labs?"

She stopped the head inspector.

"First, we have the right to conduct random spot checks."

"Second, we received a report at nine this morning that your labs failed to meet fire safety standards."

"Our inspection did indeed find problems."

"Last time the facilities were complete. This time they're severely lacking?"

The inspector's few words left Victoria speechless.

But she seized on a key piece of information.

"A report? Who reported it?"

"No comment."

The fire safety team quickly departed.

Victoria stood rooted to the spot, her face livid.

She pulled out her phone and dialed Eleanor Watson's number.

"You coward! Was it you who reported us?!"

Eleanor was momentarily taken aback when she answered.

Then she let out a light laugh. "Your lab was reported?"

"Stop playing dumb! It was you!"

"Interesting? You started it. I'm just finishing it."

"You—"

Eleanor's voice turned icy. "Victoria Lowell, harm set, harm get."

The call ended abruptly.

Victoria was shaking with rage.

Her nails dug deep into her palms.

Eleanor immediately dialed Sophia Sullivan.

"Hello, Professor?"

"Was it you who reported Victoria Lowell's lab?"

Sophia was recording experimental data.

Her fingers paused slightly at the question.

"The district fire department moved that fast? You already know."

Eleanor was silent for a moment.
###Chapter 330

Professor Victoria Lowell had just received the disciplinary notice.

Two of her labs were immediately sealed with closure orders.

Ashley Lowell's face turned pale.

Shane Holloway was pacing anxiously.

Their final project was forced to halt.

They couldn't submit their phase achievement.

Their GPAs and graduation were all affected.

Amelia Roscente stood frozen.

Everyone knew it was Sophia Sullivan's doing.

They had used underhanded tactics first.

Now they were getting a taste of their own medicine.

Fiona Valentine remained the calmest.

She had no real interest in research.

Graduate school was just for disguising.

Lab closures didn't affect her.

She had recently met Ethan Roscente.

As long as she could secure this man.

Her future would be guaranteed.

Shane's voice was strained.

The rectification deadline was indefinite.

It could drag on for months.

Sophia's lab had been closed for almost two months.

Should they build their own lab?

Victoria suddenly looked at Amelia.

Amelia felt a chill down her spine.

She forced a weak smile.

Building a lab requires land and permits.

Money is the least of the problems.

Shane, do you have any land?

Ashley, do you have the connections?

Shane's expression darkened.

It was just a thought.

Ashley lowered her head, avoiding eye contact.

Victoria looked away.

Amelia breathed a sigh of relief.

She wasn't going to be the sucker.

Sophia built her lab for herself.

Why should she spend money for Victoria?

Caleb Watson had seen this coming.

He only regretted the project's pause.

It meant he could finally rest.

And think about his future path.

...

The Dean's office.

Charlie Wilson was stunned by the news.

Who reported it?

His secretary shook his head.

It's hard to say.

Han went to find Xiao Ninghan.

Victoria Lowell's lab got reported.

Xiao put down his newspaper.

I know.

The district fire department gave a heads-up.

Han frowned.

Why didn't you stop it?

Xiao chuckled lightly.

Couldn't be stopped.

Anyone can make an anonymous call.

Han sighed.

This is retaliation.

Xiao remained calm.

Victoria struck first.

Sophia's counterattack is justified.

Han hesitated.

Victoria has good academic output.

Xiao shook his head.

Good academics don't mean good character.

She needs to learn a lesson.

Han relaxed.

Should we soothe Professor Eleanor Watson?

No need.

Eleanor only focuses on her research.

Han looked at the newspaper on the desk.

It featured an article on Sophia's self-built lab.

Xiao was silent for a moment.

Let them be.

Building a lab is a skill.

But producing results will take time.

Han laughed.

What could three first-year grad students possibly achieve?

Sophia published a commentary in Science.

But that doesn't carry much weight.

He was soon proven wrong.

Half a month later.

The No-Boundaries Lab published a paper.

The paper was published in Nature Biotechnology.

The entire university was shaken.

NBT is a Nature sub-journal.

A top-tier journal in biotechnology.

With an impact factor of 33.1.

Far surpassing Ashley's Chinese journal publication.

The paper was signed No-Boundaries Lab.

The acknowledgments made no mention of MIT.

Han was shocked and sought confirmation.

It's really NBT?

The secretary nodded.

It's already searchable online.

Han's legs went weak.

They're only first-years.

The secretary remained silent.

They are indeed first-years.

Han suddenly felt pleased.

Outstanding students bring glory to the school.

Notify them to register the academic output.

The secretary spoke with difficulty.

The paper didn't list the school's name.

Charlie Wilson was stunned.
###Chapter 331

"This is impossible!"

Charlie Wilson shot to his feet.

Sophia Sullivan and the other two were students at MIT.

Their advisor, Professor Eleanor Watson, was also a tenured faculty member.

"If not under the university's name, then under whose?"

His assistant replied quietly, "The Boundless Laboratory."

Charlie Wilson suddenly remembered something.

He grabbed his mouse and frantically scrolled through the paper.

He searched for a long time but couldn't find Eleanor Watson's name.

He muttered to himself, "...No corresponding author? That can't be..."

The assistant said, "According to regulations, if there's no corresponding author, the first author is defaulted as the corresponding author. Their procedure is correct."

The procedure was correct.

But why would Eleanor Watson do this?

She could have put her name on it.

She could have enjoyed this honor.

Why...

Nora Frost strode out of the president's office.

Charlie Wilson rarely saw him look so grim.

"Nora—what's wrong?"

Nora Frost said, "Come with me to State A!"

"Now? What for in State A?"

"To find Eleanor!"

After the unveiling ceremony.

Eleanor Watson had taken Miss. Moore back to State A to continue her convalescence.

Charlie Wilson suddenly understood. "...You know too?"

Nora Frost's face was dark.

Charlie Wilson said, "Should we try calling first? Is it necessary to go in person?"

"You still don't understand how serious this is. She did it on purpose—"

Nora Frost was agitated.

His phone suddenly rang.

It was Eleanor Watson calling.

He answered immediately.

His voice was cold and hard. "Eleanor, the university deserves an explanation!"

"Explanation?" Eleanor Watson chuckled lightly. "What explanation?"

"You privately gave up your right to authorship. And you let the students put the achievements under a private lab's name. This damages the university's interests!"

"Heh..." Eleanor Watson laughed.

She had expected the university to demand answers.

But she hadn't expected Nora Frost to be so worked up.

Then again.

It wasn't just any journal.

It was Nature Biotechnology.

A top-tier global biology journal.

So it wasn't that he didn't care.

The benefits just weren't big enough before.

Now the benefits were substantial.

And he couldn't sit still anymore.

Eleanor Watson said, "Nora, what right do you think you have to question me?"

Nora Frost was stunned.

"When Sophia Sullivan and the others were being bullied. Where was the school? Where was the university? 
###Chapter 332

All these years of Victoria Lowell's actions. Did you really not know?

"You didn't offer support. But you chose silence. Silence is a form of indulgence.

"My students. Three kids. Bullied since they enrolled. The school didn't protect them. The university turned a blind eye. What? You thought because I'm sickly, I couldn't jump up and fight you?!

"I remember you loved to say when you were young: sooner or later, everyone pays their dues. Now it's time for the university to pay up!"

Nora Frost was shaking with anger. "If you're resentful, we can talk. Is it necessary to ensure mutual destruction? What good does giving up authorship do for you, besides spiting the university? They are your students. Their output should rightfully be under your name!"

Eleanor Watson said, "I don't need any benefits. I don't need the achievements either. I've had enough in this lifetime. But the kids' roads are just beginning. Forget authorship. Even if it cost me my life, I would fight for their dignity!"

"You—"

Eleanor Watson enunciated each word clearly. "You look after your own. I'd rather forgo empty fame than let those who hurt them benefit from it! That's it. This time I didn't put my name. I never will in the future. The university better be prepared. Don't make a fuss."

Nora Frost: "..."

He could already foresee the future.

No matter how many academic achievements Sophia Sullivan and the other two produced.

None of it would be related to the university.

Charlie Wilson saw his livid expression.

He spoke cautiously. "Well? Is there any room for negotiation?"

"Not a damn bit! Extend Blake Cunningham's punishment to 12 months!"

Nora Frost turned and went back into his office.

He slammed the door shut.

Charlie Wilson was terrified.

He had never seen Nora this angry before.

...

Thwack!

In the lab's lounge area.

Marcus Lawrence hit the bullseye again.

He simply threw the remaining darts all at once.

Thwack, thwack, thwack—

Fast and accurate.

All tens!

"Wow—" Hannah Morse was dumbfounded. "Marcus, have you practiced? That's so accurate!"

Marcus Lawrence said, "Practiced for a few months."

"..." A few months? Was he humblebragging?

Hannah Morse said, "Do you think the school has gotten the news yet?"

Marcus Lawrence unscrewed his water bottle. "Probably."

"Then why is there no reaction at all?"

Sophia Sullivan put away her phone.

She looked up. "It's Professor Watson. She has already dealt with the school."

"What did the school say?" Hannah Morse's eyes widened.

"Nothing to say."

"Serves them right. They didn't help when we were being bullied. Now they see benefits and want to get close. How can such a good thing exist in the world? Today is a good day. I've decided to have a cheat meal."

Marcus Lawrence frowned. "I thought you weren't dieting anymore?"

Hannah Morse said, "I'm not. But last week's physical showed fatty liver disease. I need to control it."

Marcus Lawrence: "..."

"What's that expression for?! Looking down on me!"

"No..."

"Yes, you are!"

"I wanted to say... let me help you with your diet."

"You?" Hannah Morse looked skeptical. "Can you? You've never dieted."

"Who said I haven't—"

Hannah Morse: "Hmm?"

Marcus Lawrence: "...Anyway, I can help. Don't believe me? Let's try."

"Come on!"

"Okay. Tomorrow morning at six. I'll wait for you downstairs."

"Wh-what for?"

"Morning run."

Hannah Morse: "You know... I suddenly think dieting is my own business. I better not trouble you!"

Evening.

Before leaving the lab.

Marcus Lawrence had already walked out.

He came back to Hannah Morse. "Remember. Six tomorrow morning."

"Wait... I didn't agree! Come back—"

Marcus Lawrence turned a deaf ear.

He walked straight away.

Hannah Morse: "?"

...

January 29th.

Marcus Lawrence's birthday.

It happened to be a Saturday.

His family wanted to invite relatives and friends to gather.

Not public.

No big fuss.

Just a regular family dinner.

Liam Lawrence called his son over.

He said he could invite a table of his own friends.

Marcus Lawrence immediately invited Sophia Sullivan and Hannah Morse.

On the day of the birthday.

Sophia Sullivan and Hannah Morse set out from the lab.

Headed to the Lawrence residence.

Before coming.

They had thought Marcus Lawrence's family was unusual.

But when they really arrived at the door.

And saw the patrolling security team with their own eyes.

They realized just how "unusual" it was.
###Chapter 333

The Lawrence family estate stood near the historic city center.

Its dark bricks and gray tiles spoke of timeless elegance.

Two stone lions guarded the entrance in silent vigilance.

The vermilion doors opened to a spacious courtyard.

Seasonal vegetables grew along the bluestone pathways.

Tender spinach and vibrant chives thrived in the winter sun.

Hannah Morse’s eyes widened.

“A vegetable garden in the city center?”

Marcus Lawrence greeted them with a warm smile.

“Come inside, it’s cold out.”

His red sweater made him look especially spirited.

Mr. Lawrence, Jingsheng, waited under the corridor’s eaves.

Dressed in a dark gray suit, he carried an air of refined intellect.

Mrs. Lawrence, Lihua, approached with a fruit platter.

An emerald cheongsam and cashmere shawl complemented her gentle smile.

They welcomed the girls warmly.

Hannah nervously twisted the hem of her coat.

Sophia Sullivan gave her hand a reassuring squeeze.

In the main hall, an elder sat in a traditional armchair.

His presence commanded respect and authority.

Hannah inhaled sharply.

Sophia remained composed as she presented her gift.

It was a set of fine calligraphy tools.

Marcus accepted it with delight.

“How did you know I’d love this?”

Sophia simply smiled.

Hannah offered a limited-edition gaming console.

Marcus’s eyes lit up even more.

“Thank you both.”

The birthday dinner was held in the east wing.

Only two tables were set.

One for the Lawrence family and their relatives.

The other for Marcus’s friends and classmates.

Sophia and Hannah were seated at the second table.

Several other young guests were already there.

Marcus made the introductions.

“These are my childhood friends.”

A young man in a black sweatshirt extended his hand.

“I’m Zachary.”

Sophia shook it lightly.

Hannah, mid-bite with a pastry, offered an apologetic smile.

The man beside Zachary spoke up.

“You look familiar.”

Sophia glanced up.

It was Benjamin.

Ethan Roscente’s business partner.

She recognized him.

Zachary asked curiously, “You know her, Ben?”

Benjamin smiled suggestively.

“Aren’t you Mr. Roscente’s—”

Marcus cut him off.

“It’s my birthday, Ben.”

His tone held a clear warning.

Benjamin immediately backtracked.

“My mistake, sorry.”

He raised his glass in apology.

But his eyes lingered on Sophia.

She lowered her gaze to her tea.

Noise erupted from the main table.

A painted screen separated the two groups.

Benjamin took his drink and moved behind it.

An enthusiastic voice carried over.

“Professor Shaw, I’ve heard so much about you…”

Sophia’s hand stilled.

Professor Shaw?

She looked toward the screen.

Silhouettes moved behind the ink-wash painting.

Their features were unclear.

Marcus placed a osmanthus cake on her plate.

“Try this, our chef’s specialty.”

Hannah leaned in and whispered.

“That Professor Shaw… could it be…?”

Sophia shook her head gently.

She signaled not to ask.

Halfway through the dinner, a chair scraped behind the screen.

A familiar figure stepped into view.

A charcoal gray overcoat. Gold-rimmed glasses.

Alexander Laurent approached with a glass in hand.

His gaze fixed directly on Sophia.

“What a coincidence.”
Sophia Sullivan lowered her gaze, quietly picking at her food.

The Lawrence family banquet was of the highest standard.
It was said they had specially hired a former White House executive chef.
Every dish was as exquisite as a work of art.

Even the dessert was the famously delicate almond tofu.

Hannah Morse's eyes sparkled as she ate.

"Sophia, this is incredible… that one is amazing too… you have to try it…"

Her cheeks were stuffed full, but she still remembered to recommend dishes to Sophia.

Sophia chuckled softly. "Okay, I'm eating it."

Marcus Lawrence suddenly stood up. "Sophia, Hannah, come with me for a moment."

They both looked up simultaneously.

Hannah: "What for?"

Her face was a mask of reluctance that clearly said, "Don't interrupt my meal."

Marcus: "To go greet the elders at the main table."

Hannah really wanted to refuse.

They weren't familiar with those people.
There would be nothing to talk about.

It was better to just eat a few more bites.

But Marcus had personally come to get them.
And they were the Lawrence family elders.
It would be impolite to decline.

They picked up their drinks and followed him to the main table.

Behind the screen, Sophia immediately spotted Alexander Laurent.

Her steps faltered slightly.

The elder Mr. Lawrence sat at the head of the table.
On either side were Mrs. Lawrence and Liam Evans.

Alexander Laurent sat next to Liam Evans.

What surprised her even more was that Sebastian Evans was also there, seated right beside Alexander.

"Marcus—" The old lady beamed upon seeing her grandson. "Are these your two classmates?"

Sophia and Hannah said in unison, "Hello, Grandma."

"Good, good, such good girls."

Liam Evans walked over to Marcus, smiling as he gestured to Sophia and Hannah. "These are Marcus's classmates. Comrades from the lab."

He introduced everyone at the table one by one.

Neglected to the side, Zachary Wang watched this scene, grinding his teeth in frustration.

After the introductions, Liam smiled at the three of them. "You brought your glasses, right? Go offer a toast to your uncles."

He then looked at the others. "The kids are still students. They'll use drinks instead of alcohol. The sentiment is what matters."

Someone immediately chimed in. "Of course we can't let the kids drink. Drinks are fine. We're family; we don't stand on ceremony."

Sophia and Hannah exchanged a look.
They had no choice but to follow Marcus and offer toasts to each person in turn.

When it was Alexander's turn, Sophia couldn't bring herself to call him "Uncle."
She only softly addressed him as "Professor."

Alexander's expression darkened slightly.
As he picked up his glass, he shot a glance at Liam Evans.

Liam: "?"

Why did it suddenly feel cold?

Alexander's presence today was purely accidental.

The elder Mr. Laurent and the elder Mr. Lawrence were old friends of many years.
But the two families hadn't interacted frequently in recent times.

For this Lawrence family banquet, Frederick Laurent had originally planned to attend himself.
But he was suddenly hospitalized for an asthma attack.

The eldest son, Mr. Roscente, was to represent him.
But his status as a businessman was sensitive.
It wasn't suitable for him to associate closely with the Lawrence family.

The second son, Mr. Winston, was a lawyer.
His status was even more sensitive.

In the end, only Alexander could go.

When Mr. Roscente made the suggestion, he was fully prepared to be refused.

To his surprise, Alexander actually agreed.

"…You're really going?"

Alexander nodded. "Yeah. Your jaw's hitting the floor."

Mr. Roscente silently closed his mouth, his expression one of sheer disbelief.

He immediately went to find Sylvia Laurent. "Mom, I think something's wrong with Alexander."

Sylvia: "?"

Mr. Roscente: "Should you find a mystic to check on him?"

"Check what?"

"I suspect he's been possessed."

Sylvia: "…"

Alexander offered no explanation.

He just wanted to see if she would come.

Now, facing Alexander, Sophia could still get away with calling him "Professor."
But when it was Sebastian's turn…

Calling him "Uncle" was absolutely impossible.

Marcus and Hannah also looked extremely awkward.

During the lab's establishment, they had dealt with Sebastian frequently and were quite familiar with him.

They usually called him "Mr. Evans."
How had he suddenly become "Uncle"?

Liam, unaware of the situation, urged, "Marcus, lead the way. Greet him."

Marcus: "…"

Sebastian smiled and raised his glass. "Don't. I'm not that much older than them. Calling me 'Uncle' makes me feel ancient."

His gaze swept over Sophia, the corner of his mouth quirking up. "Just call me Sebastian."

Marcus breathed a sigh of relief. "Sebastian, a toast to you."

"Thanks. But… 'Sebastian' doesn't sound right. I prefer 'Bash.'"

Hannah readily adapted. "Bash."

Finally, it was Sophia's turn…

She felt a laugh bubbling up.
This man really never missed a chance to gain an upper hand.

Fine, he won this round.

Just as she was about to open her mouth and call him "Bash," Alexander suddenly spoke—
###Chapter 334

A Good Match?

Wait.
I remember the Evans and Lawrence families are distantly related.
By that reckoning.
Marcus should call you... Cousin?

Sebastian Evans became a welcome guest at the Lawrence house.
It was all thanks to this distant family connection.

Alexander Laurent's lips curved slightly. "Marcus's classmate.
Naturally, she follows his lead.
Calling you 'Cousin' isn't out of line."

Sebastian's face darkened instantly.

The Evans and Lawrence families were indeed connected.
But the relation was extremely distant.
Alexander deliberately dragged this connection out.
And put it right out in the open.

Sophia Sullivan's eyes sparkled with mischief.
She called out sweetly, "Hello, Cousin~"

She almost burst out laughing.

Sebastian: "..."

Infuriating.
Who wants to be her cousin?

Alexander Laurent—
He'd remember this.

...
Dinner ended.
The cake was wheeled out.

Liam Lawrence patted his son's shoulder. "Marcus.
Happy birthday.
May you be like this cake.
Always maintaining your edges.
Never smoothed by time.
Never spoiled by age."

"Thanks, Dad."

Linda Lawrence stood nearby. "Make a wish, sweetie."

Previous birthdays were never big affairs.
This was the first time.
Family and friends were all here.
Marcus felt a warmth in his heart.

He closed his eyes.
He was silent for a moment.
He didn't clasp his hands.
But his gaze was firm.

He blew out the candles.

Hannah Morse led the applause.
Everyone joined in.

When cutting the cake.
Marcus handed the first piece to Sophia.

She was stunned.
The elders were all here.
Why give it to her first?

Marcus said slowly, "I rarely admire anyone.
But you are an exception."

Fighting in desperate situations.
Surviving through hardships.
Going all out once a goal is set.

Intelligent, strong, calm personality.
She possessed everything he aspired to.

Marcus: "To our three musketeers.
Charging forward fearlessly.
Unstoppable!"

Sophia took the cake.
A surge of emotion warmed her heart. "Yes.
Breaking through thorns and thistles.
Riding the wind and waves."

Hannah smiled, her eyes crinkling. "The Boundless three musketeers.
Hearts aligned, swords pointed forward!"

The three looked at each other.
Full of passion and ambition.

Years later, sitting in his office at the National Academy of Sciences.
Marcus would still smile at this memory.

They were full of dreams back then.
Brimming with lofty aspirations.
Marching forward courageously.

Striving and climbing were the themes of youth.
The most memorable recollections.

Liam and his wife exchanged a glance.

Linda said hesitantly, "Has our son finally noticed girls? It's the first time I've seen him actively cut cake for one."

Liam lowered his voice. "What's the big deal? When I was twenty, I made you a cake with my own hands.
And fed it to you with my mouth..."

"Ugh! Don't talk nonsense here..." Linda pinched his waist, her cheeks flushing.

They were childhood sweethearts from similar backgrounds.
They dated young and now their son was grown.
Their affection remained as sweet as ever.

Liam grinned through the pain. "Our son's growing up, it's normal for him to develop feelings. What young woman doesn't harbor secret dreams? What young man doesn't feel attraction?"

Linda looked Sophia over. "Lovely figure, great posture, excellent气质 (poise)! She took the lead in building the lab. So capable!"

The more she looked, the more pleased she was. "MIT was unfair. She kept her cool in a crisis, came up with a solution, and made it work! Outstanding and visionary. I don't object if our son likes her."

Liam seemed thoughtful.

The Lawrence family was already at its peak.
No need for a political marriage.

If the daughter-in-law were Sophia Sullivan...
It seemed rather good.

Liam's eyes lit up. "I don't object either. I listen to my wife~"

Alexander Laurent and Sebastian Evans stood nearby: "..."

Were they invisible?

Alexander's gaze turned cool.
Sebastian's face was expressionless.

Liam nudged Alexander's shoulder. "Alexander.
Sophia is your student?"

"Yes."

"You seem to get along well?"

"What are you getting at, Liam?"

"Hehe... Just asking. Are Sophia's parents from Kyoto? Do you know them? Can you introduce us sometime? Make friends?"

Alexander: "Don't know. Don't know them."

"I see..." Liam wasn't disappointed. "What do you think of Sophia? Would she and Marcus be a good match? Our son is sunny and handsome. Sophia is smart and beautiful. A perfect pair!"

He was already calculating the number of tables for the wedding banquet.

Alexander: "..."

"Alexander, why so quiet?"

"About what?"

"Whether they're suitable!"

"Oh.
Not suitable."

Liam was taken aback. "Why? They seem perfect to me!"

Alexander remained silent.

Liam turned to Sebastian.
Asking the same question.

Sebastian's gaze traveled through the crowd and landed on Marcus.

Handsomer than his father.
Tall enough.
But too young, lacking experience.
His steadiness was just a facade, not mature enough.

Sophia wasted six years on a failed relationship and a persistent ex-boyfriend.
Why would she be interested in a greenhorn like Marcus?

Someone who could grow with Marcus would have to be his own age.

He thought... that plump girl seemed nice.

Liam pressed: "...Well? A good match?"

Sebastian shook his head. "In my opinion.
He's not worthy."

Liam waved his hand. "Outsiders might think Miss Sullivan comes from an ordinary family.
But go back a few generations, who wasn't a farmer? We live in a harmonious society where everyone is equal. Free love. 'Marrying within one's social class' is a outdated concept! Miss Sullivan is sweet, beautiful, a good student. Professor Watson speaks highly of her. A promising future..."

Sebastian interrupted: "When I said not worthy.
I meant your son is not—" worthy of her!
###Chapter 335

Sebastian Evans hadn't even finished speaking when Alexander Laurent cut in.

"Old Lin, you've had too much to drink."

"They're still students. Their studies come first."

"Don't talk about these baseless things."

"It won't be good for anyone if this spreads."

Lin Jingsheng paused, suddenly realizing his mistake.

"Look at me, a few extra drinks and I start talking nonsense…"

"Students should focus on their studies."

"As for other matters… let nature take its course!"

He turned to attend to other guests.

Alexander remained standing there, his gaze calm.

"You shouldn't have said that earlier."

Sebastian raised an eyebrow.

"Does Professor Laurent have an opinion?"

"No parent wants to hear someone speak poorly of their child."

"Mr. Evans can do as he pleases."

"But next time before you speak, consider whether it might implicate others."

Sebastian frowned.

"You think I didn't consider Sophia Sullivan?"

"Was that consideration?" Alexander turned to look directly at him.

"Mr. Evans is a smart man. Some things don't need to be spelled out."

"Don't act so thoughtful."

"You're not the only one in this world who cares about Sophia Sullivan."

"I care about her more than you do."

"Fine. Since you care, don't put her in dangerous situations."

"Dangerous? It was just a sentence. No need to be so tense, Professor."

"Today it's a sentence. What about tomorrow?"

"People who are used to acting on impulse also act without considering consequences."

"The Lin family is magnanimous."

"If it were another family, or another person, what do you think it would bring her?"

Sebastian's expression faltered slightly, his gaze deepening.

"If you truly want what's best for her, you should consider every aspect."

Having said that, Alexander turned and left.

…

After eating cake, Sophia had cream on her hands.

Even after using a tissue, they still felt sticky.

She told Hannah Morse and went to the restroom.

She ran into Sebastian on her way out.

He handed her a bottle of mineral water.

"The cake is very sweet. Have some water."

During the dinner, Sebastian noticed she took one sip of her drink and never touched it again.

Clearly, she didn't like it.

Sophia was正好 thirsty and reached out to take it.

"Thank you."

The two walked together from the restroom back to the main courtyard.

They had to pass through a connecting corridor and make two turns.

The Lawrence family's courtyard was very large and complex.

Two courtyards, corridors connected to corridors, many similar small paths.

They obviously got lost.

Sophia looked at Sebastian.

He spread his hands.

"Don't look at me. I don't know the way either."

"Aren't you a relative of the Lawrence family?"

"So distant we're in different genealogy books."

Sophia was speechless.

"But my sense of direction is pretty good. Follow me and let's try."

Sebastian led Sophia through countless twists and turns until they arrived at a small courtyard.

The courtyard had a bamboo fence serving as an exhibition wall, hung with photos of Marcus Lawrence as a child.

From birth to full month, then first birthday, five years old, ten years old…

Sophia picked up one photo.

It showed Marcus just born, crying with snot and tears all over his face, wrinkled like a little monkey.

There were also several from when he was three years old.

A little boy the size of a radish, wearing a furry onesie and a girl's headband with two Teletubby-like antennae.

His nose and eyes were red, tears not yet dry from crying.

Ten years old…

"So fat?!" Sophia blurted out.

In the photo, Marcus had lost his childhood cuteness and was fat like a little black bear.

Not only fat, but also dark.

The fat on his face squeezed his eyes into two slits.

He wore a summer shirt and shorts, revealing stout and plump limbs.

Sophia cleared her throat and said sternly to Sebastian, "Don't look. It's not good to peek at privacy."

"Didn't you look too?"

"I did it unintentionally. I'm not looking now."

Sebastian said, "Isn't displaying it here meant for people to see?"

"Wow! Is this little chubby ball Marcus Lawrence?"

"How is he like an inflated balloon?"

Sophia: "...You're really mean."

Sebastian retorted, "You're not mean? Then stop laughing."

Sophia quickly pressed her lips together but still couldn't hold back.

Thinking of the usually disciplined Marcus, who avoided carbonated drinks, having such a sad history.

The corners of her mouth were harder to suppress than an AK.

No wonder he was so disciplined; he had suffered from being a chubby kid.

Sebastian saw her struggling to hold back and laughed too.

Suddenly—

"What's so funny?" Alexander's faint voice sounded behind them.

Sophia's smile vanished instantly.

"P-professor, why are you here?"

Sebastian turned to look at the newcomer.

Alexander's gaze swept over the two, lingering on Sophia's not yet retracted smiling face.

He paused, his tone slightly softer.

"Something good? Can you tell me?"

Before Sophia could speak, Sebastian spoke first.

"Sorry, this is between us... a secret~"

Alexander ignored him, only asking Sophia, "Is that so?"

Sophia rolled her eyes at Sebastian.

"What secret? You make it sound so exaggerated..."

"Professor, come look."

Alexander stepped forward, positioning himself between the two, separating someone.

Sebastian: "..."

Sophia pointed to a photo.

"Professor, guess who this is?"

Alexander glanced at it.

"Do you think Marcus Lawrence knows you're doing this?"

Speak of the devil.

Hannah: "Sophia, so you're here—"

"Marcus and I have been looking for you everywhere—"

"What are you all crowded together looking at? Let me see too..."

Then...

"HAHAHAHAHA..." After a burst of wild laughter, Hannah couldn't straighten up.

"Marcus, why didn't you tell me you used to be fat?"

"Even fatter than me! So huge!"

She gestured with her hands just how huge.

Marcus, who was a step too late to stop her: "..." Doomed!

…

Marcus led the way, and the group returned to the main courtyard.

Lin Jingsheng and Omelas Lihua were seeing guests off.

The elder Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence had left early after cutting the cake.

"Marcus is back?" Lin Jingsheng smiled and waved.

But...

Why did his son look so upset?

He didn't think too much of it.

"Arrange for the driver to take the classmates back..."

Sebastian: "No need. I'll take Sophia Sullivan."

Lin Jingsheng was stunned.

"You?"

"Yes, is there a problem?"

"MIT isn't on the way to your place, is it? Did I remember wrong?"

Sebastian: "..."

Alexander: "I'm on the way."

He took out his keys and said to Sophia, "Let's go."
###Chapter 336

Sebastian, do you know the author?

Sophia Sullivan smiled and nodded.

"I'll head out first. Goodbye, Uncle, Auntie."

Hannah Morse immediately moved closer.

"Take me with you! I'm going the same way!"

Marcus Lawrence held her back.

"Stop inviting yourself. I'll drive you."

Hannah hesitated.

Mainly because she had laughed too loudly earlier.

She was afraid this petty guy would settle the score on the way.

Marcus's tone was firm.

"I think it's a good idea."

Hannah had no choice but to give up.

Sebastian Evans watched Alexander Laurent and Sophia Sullivan leave side by side.

He narrowed his long, fox-like eyes.

As she got in the car, Sophia took off her scarf.

Alexander naturally reached out and took it.

She actually handed it to him.

Linus walked over and patted his shoulder.

"You still want to give her a ride? You drank quite a bit just now. Can't break the law."

Sebastian frowned.

"What about Alexander? Did he drink?"

"No." Linus waved his hand.

"So sure?"

"He was sitting right next to me. I saw clearly."

Sebastian raised an eyebrow.

"Then why was there a glass by his hand? With clear liquor in it?"

"That was Sprite."

Sebastian fell silent.

Well played, Alexander Laurent!

Another mark against you.

The driver brought the car over.

Sebastian got in and left.

He watched the scenery flash by outside the window.

His fingers lightly stroked his chin.

He considered buying a place near Sophia.

Next time, Alexander wouldn't be the only one going her way.

But he quickly suppressed the thought.

Getting too close would scare the little rabbit.

Once scared, she would hide.

Never letting him get close again.

Ethan Roscente was a cautionary tale.

He couldn't make the same mistake.

Alexander Laurent got off lightly!

The night was deep, the starry river twinkling.

The city's noise gradually quieted.

Usually, the driver would take him back to the Evans residence.

But Sebastian suddenly remembered the matter from this morning.

The Atlante family's housekeeper had called.

He was in a meeting at the time.

When he called back, another housekeeper answered.

He asked about the old master and mistress.

The housekeeper said everything was fine.

Probably not a health issue.

Must be some other non-urgent matter.

He hadn't visited the two elders in a while either.

Sebastian instructed the driver to change course to the Atlante residence.

The Atlante villa had a somewhat European style.

Located within the third ring road.

It was the old master and mistress's temporary residence.

Entering required passing through a small garden first.

Large swathes of wisteria climbed over the glass greenhouse.

The entire sunroom looked like a giant purple flower basket.

Emilia had loved wisteria since she was little.

Wherever they lived, the old mistress demanded a garden.

They specially built a sunroom.

Atlante Gardens also had large stretches of wisteria.

Swing sets were arranged among the trees.

It was said to be Emilia's secret base.

Sebastian looked at the meticulously maintained wisteria.

He sighed softly.

Wondering if he could make up for the two elders' regret in his lifetime.

"Grandpa! Grandma!"

Sebastian called out loudly as he entered.

Isaac Atlante smiled as he came to greet him.

"Sebastian?! What brings you here?"

Sebastian changed into slippers.

He took off his coat and hung it up.

"Not welcome me?"

"This time… doesn't seem like your style."

Sebastian supported him as they walked towards the living room.

"I come when I want. Do I need to pick a time?"

"Sounds like a routine duty visit."

"Of course? You're a very busy man."

"Grandpa, are you making fun of me or praising me?"

The old master laughed heartily.

Sebastian sat down on the sofa.

Something poked him.

He reached under and pulled out a book.

He looked at the cover after closing it.

"Seven-Day Talk"!

"Isn't this the book from my car?"

He habitually folded page corners as markers.

The creases were still there.

"Yes! I took it from your car last time. Didn't expect it to be so gripping!"

Sebastian raised an eyebrow.

"You read it?"

The old master nodded.

"Read half of it."

"So before I came in, you were sitting here reading this book?"

Isaac pushed his reading glasses up.

"What? Can't I?"

"Can your eyes handle it?"

The old mistress in the rocking chair suddenly spoke.

"That's what I told him! Told him to download a reading app, using the audiobook function is much more convenient."

Sebastian was surprised.

"Grandma, you're listening to this book too?"

Florence Atlante nodded.

"Yes! Sebastian, come here, this book is so interesting!"

"Interesting?"

"Listen to these two descriptions at the beginning. Close your eyes and imagine the scene…"

Sebastian took the headphones and put them on.

"…Lin Quan was soaked through, the rain still falling. A villa appeared ahead, the car was broken, and it was dark. He wanted to go in to take shelter from the rain… Approaching, he saw two huge wrought iron gates. Directly above was a bauhinia design, painted silver. In the middle was a row of winged angels, golden. Further down were scattered thornbirds and bushes…"

"…After entering, he first saw two crystal chandeliers. The lamp pendants were sea blue… That pure blue was enticing, yet also seemed unnatural…"

Florence asked.

"Hear anything?"

Sebastian was astonished.

"This wrought iron gate, and the crystal lamp with aquamarine pendants…"

"Very familiar, right?!"

He nodded.

Florence pressed further.

"Think about real life. Have you seen it somewhere before?"

Sebastian suddenly looked up.

The crystal chandelier above hung with blue lamp pendants!

That blue was exactly like the one described in the novel.

"Deep, rich, crystal clear and translucent, like the tranquil point where sea and sky meet in the ocean's depths, smelling the profundity and mystery of death."

Sebastian said softly.

"Our family's crystal chandelier?"

Florence nodded excitedly.

"Isn't it amazing? Other places in the book also have shadows of our home. It's simply unbelievable!"

Sebastian held his forehead.

"Probably just a coincidence. The book describes two lamps. We only have one."

The old mistress knew, but still found it marvelous.

"By the way, Sebastian, do you know the author?"
###Chapter 337

The elderly woman gently traced the book's spine with her fingertip.
"Isabella Sullivan… that name sounds so familiar."

She murmured to herself, a flicker of confusion in her eyes.

The author's name on the cover made her pause.

The elderly man sighed softly, clearly also drawn in by the name.

They had only intended to browse casually, but found themselves increasingly engrossed.

The woman casually asked Sebastian Evans if he knew the author.

To her surprise, he nodded without hesitation.

Sebastian briefly explained his connection to Isabella Sullivan.

Isaac Atlante suddenly understood, recalling the girl he had met at Kinokuniya Books.

So, a book signing had been happening upstairs that day.

He couldn't help but smile. "What a remarkable coincidence."

Florence Atlante remembered the girl's gentle and refined manner of speaking, her heart stirring slightly.

"That child has excellent manners. So soft-spoken and polite."

She thought to herself, how wonderful it would be to see her again.

…

Nina Moore, as was her custom, flew to Australia to escape the winter cold.

Her studio employees were long accustomed to her annual disappearance at this time.

After all, the boss made good money; she deserved to enjoy herself.

But no one knew the exact source of Nina Moore's wealth.

They only knew it was a cultural publishing studio.

Nina Moore signed established authors every year.

Then these authors would simply vanish without a trace.

Once bestselling writers seemed to have run out of talent.

If they couldn't produce new work, why did Nina Moore keep signing them?

How did the studio actually make money?

"Stop overthinking it. We're just employees, why worry about that?"
"Just coasting along. The pay isn't great, but it's easy. But aren't you curious?"
"Curious about what?"
"Director Moore never produces hits. Signing authors costs a fortune. Where does her income come from?"
"Why ask? I don't know."
"Sister Omelas, you're in finance. The cash flow goes through you. Don't hide it from me. I promise I won't tell anyone!"

Sister Omelas hesitated for a moment, but her desire to share ultimately won out.

She lowered her voice. "Signing famous authors is definitely profitable."
"What do you mean?"
"These authors hold the copyrights to their bestsellers. Director Moore signs them and gets full copyright agency rights. Then she turns around and sells them for film and short dramas."
"Without the authors' consent?"
"The contract terms are all written clearly! When a signature is needed, they just get someone to forge it. The buyers never check."
"So all the money goes into Director Moore's pocket? The authors have no idea?"
Sister Omelas took a sip of her coffee. "How else could she afford luxury cars and designer goods? I heard one of her bags costs hundreds of thousands."
"Hermès."
"Tsk tsk... The worst case is that suspense author. The copyrights for her two early hits were sold off completely. They still bring in a five-figure income for the studio every month."
"A suspense author? There's an Isabella Sullivan who wrote 'Seven Day Tales' that's really popular lately."
"Isabella?!" Sister Omelas jolted. "The author who got fleeced was also named something like 'Min'."
"It couldn't be the same person, could it?"
"Impossible. Director Moore would never let her publish a new book." Sister Omelas relaxed.
"True." The colleague nodded.

Her finger secretly pressed the stop recording button under the table.
"Thanks for the coffee. This place is really hard to get."
"Glad you like it, Sister Omelas. Share more gossip next time!"
"Sure, sure!"

…

Nina Moore was in Australia, enjoying the sun and sand.

Her plan was to stay until spring before returning home.

Then one day, while shopping, she walked into a bookstore.

The English version of "Seven Day Tales" was prominently displayed in the window.

The author's name on the cover was in bold Chinese characters—

Isabella Sullivan!

Nina Moore's first thought was that it must be a different person with the same name.

She immediately logged onto domestic websites to search.

The results made her blood run cold.

It wasn't a different person. Her operation had been exposed!

She had been too absorbed in her vacation, neglecting to keep up with domestic news.

Isabella actually dared to betray her!

Nina Moore booked a flight home that very night.

After landing, she went straight to the high-speed rail station, heading for the neighboring city.

She had someone find Isabella's new address.

Staring at the impressive villa before her, Nina Moore smirked coldly.

So, she's making real money now?

Living in a detached house already
###Chapter 338

David Sullivan had gone to school to teach.

Only Isabella was left at home.

Since returning from Kyoto, she had begun brainstorming her new book.

This time, she planned to write a horror novel centered around campus legends.

Her daughter called to invite them to the laboratory's completion ceremony.

Both husband and wife politely declined.

David had classes and couldn't get away.

Isabella needed to seclude herself for writing and couldn't be disturbed.

The story was mostly finished.

The final volume was nearing its conclusion.

She had been secluded recently, rushing to complete the manuscript.

A knocking sound interrupted her deep immersion in the plot.

She walked while still thinking about the storyline.

"You're back early today, don't—"

Editor Moore stood outside the door, smiling.

"Long time no see, Isabella."

Isabella frowned.

"It's you?"

"Aren't you going to invite me in?" Moore Qian glanced inside nonchalantly.

Luxuriously decorated.

It seemed they had truly struck it rich.

Without waiting for Isabella's refusal, she walked in wearing her high heels.

Isabella didn't want to see her.

But the other party wasn't making a scene and was all smiles.

It would be impolite to kick her out.

She also wanted to see what Moore Qian's purpose was today.

"Have a seat." Isabella poured a glass of water and placed it on the coffee table.

After sitting down, Moore Qian looked around.

She carefully examined the villa.

"Isabella, why didn't you tell me you moved? I had to search all over your old place. Your phone is always off. It took a lot of effort to find you here."

Isabella didn't respond to that.

She got straight to the point.

"What do you want?"

"Our contract is almost up. We've had a good partnership these years. Renewing is just a formality. I brought the contract today. It'll be quick, just sign here."

Moore Qian took documents and a pen from her bag.

Isabella laughed.

It was a laugh of anger.

"Editor Moore, that's absurd. First, the contract isn't almost up. It has already expired."

"Second, how good our partnership has been, we both know. Let's skip the pleasantries."

"Knowing all this, you still want me to sign a renewal? Do you really think I'm a fool?"

The Isabella in Moore Qian's memory had always been non-confrontational and serene.

Even during arguments, she was restrained.

She had never been this sharp before.

"Isabella, what do you mean?" Moore Qian looked shocked and hurt. "All these years, we..."

"Editor Moore, I'm not as stupid as you think. You came today because you saw 'Seven-Day Talk,' right? But you were too slow."

It had been almost four months since 'Seven-Day Talk' was published and distributed.

During that time, Moore Qian had only called twice, and both calls were automatically blocked by Isabella's phone.

There had been no other contact.

Isabella said, "I guess you were waiting for me to come begging you to renew, right?"

That's why Moore Qian had calmly left her out in the cold.

If 'Seven-Day Talk' hadn't been a smash hit, Moore Qian would still be ignoring her.

Moore Qian's eyes flickered as she forced a smile.

"Isabella, that's not what I meant. You must have misunderstood me..."

"Drop the act. Let's be frank. I've already signed with another publisher. 'Seven-Day Talk' was published by them. I won't be renewing with you. For the sake of our ten-year history, let's part on good terms."

"Part on good terms?" Moore Qian let out a cold laugh, finally dropping the pretense. "You say 'part' and we part? Who's going to compensate me for my losses?"

"What losses?" Isabella's expression was incredulous.

"I spent so much money to sign you for ten years. For a whole decade, you didn't write a single good book. Then you turn around, sign with someone else, and immediately have a bestseller. Isabella, were you deliberately trying to spite me?"

"Was it that I didn't want to write? You were the one who kept rejecting my ideas and refusing to publish them. How many book outlines did I submit to you over those ten years? Have you counted? They were all rejected! How was I supposed to produce a bestseller? A quality work?"

"You—"

"As for the initial signing fee, you did pay a lot. But you also tied me down for ten years. For those ten years, you were managing the copyrights of my old books, right? You know exactly how much money you made."

Moore Qian's eyes darted around, a guilty look flashing across them.

How did she know about the old book copyrights?

Isabella said, "You must be wondering how I found out? I had a lawyer review the contract. You secretly added a clause authorizing you to represent and manage the copyrights of my old books. You didn't explain it clearly when I signed and just had me sign it."

"Heh... So you're digging up the past now? Even had a lawyer look it over? Seems you've been guarding against me for a while."

"Think what you want. I can let all that slide. But from now on, please don't bother me anymore."

Isabella stood up to see her out.

Moore Qian stood up with a cold laugh.

"Oh, so you're cutting ties with me completely? Too bad, I don't agree!"

"What right do you have to disagree?! Our contract has expired."

"Then we'll renew it."

Isabella said, "You're being unreasonable! You're not welcome in my home. Please leave—"

She turned to walk towards the study.

Moore Qian followed her.

"You think just because you've found a better branch, you can shake me off?! Dream on!"

"I said, please leave—"

"I'm not leaving today! What are you going to do about it?!"

Isabella had never seen someone so shameless.

Furious, she took out her phone.

"You won't leave? Fine, then I'm calling the police!"

She was going to dial 911.

"What are you doing?!" Moore Qian tried to grab the phone.

In the struggle, they pushed open the study door.

Moore Qian's eyes immediately fell on the computer open on the desk.

The screen clearly showed a writing program.

Her eyes narrowed. She pushed Isabella aside and strode towards the computer.

She wanted to see what masterpiece was being written!

Why couldn't she write it under me, but can write it for another editor?

Isabella's face changed.

"What are you doing—"

"A new book? What, can't I see it?"

Isabella rushed over, trying to grab the computer first.

But Moore Qian was faster.

"Put my computer down!" Isabella panicked.

All her manuscripts were on that computer.

She hadn't uploaded what she wrote this morning to the cloud yet...

Seeing her panic, Moore Qian immediately lifted the computer high overhead.

"Writing a new book, are you? Let's see you write now!"

"No—"
###Chapter 339

In Kyoto, at the Aeterna Labs.

Sophia Sullivan stood before the lab bench.

She was modifying the data for the third time.

Marcus Lawrence and Hannah Morse exchanged a glance.

Both sensed something was off.

Hannah spoke softly. "Sophia, didn't you rest well last night?"

Sophia rubbed her temples.

She frowned slightly. "My eyelids have been twitching all day. I feel uneasy."

"Left or right?"

"Both."

Hannah was momentarily speechless.

At noon, Sophia managed to take a short nap.

She had hoped it would ease her discomfort.

But her eyelids continued to twitch relentlessly.

It felt like an omen of something bad.

By evening, the experimental data was finally verified.

Sophia stretched her stiff body.

Hannah came over. "I'm done here too. How about you, Marcus?"

Marcus gave a thumbs-up.

Hannah smiled. "No late night tonight. Let's get dinner? My treat."

Sophia shook her head. "You two go ahead. I just want to go home and rest."

She had been pushing herself too hard lately.

All she wanted now was a good night's sleep.

Hannah didn't press further. "Get some rest then, Sophia."

Sophia nodded gently.

The taxi moved through the night.

Sophia leaned against the window, drowsy.

A sudden ringtone jolted her awake.

The screen showed "Dad."

She answered immediately. "Dad?"

David Sullivan's anxious voice came through. "Sophia, your mother is hurt. Come home right away!"

Sophia was instantly alert. "Mom's hurt? What happened?"

"Nina Moore showed up at the house today…"

Isabella had tried to catch a laptop and hit her head on the corner of a table.

She was bleeding profusely.

Fortunately, David returned in time and rushed her to the hospital.

The wound required three stitches. She had a minor concussion and needed to be observed for two days.

Sophia gripped her phone tightly. "Where is Nina Moore?"

David sighed. "...She ran away."

Sophia clenched her jaw.

She booked the earliest flight that night.

She arrived in the neighboring city at 3 a.m.

Early the next morning, Sophia brought freshly made oatmeal porridge and chicken broth, simmered for three hours, to the hospital.

Isabella was surprised to see her. "Sophia?!"

David was also stunned. "Why didn't you say anything? I could have picked you up."

Isabella immediately understood her husband had called. "I'm fine. Why did you call Sophia back? She's busy with the lab…"

Sophia gently interrupted. "Mom, I'm already here. You can't just pack me up and send me back to school."

Isabella shook her head helplessly.

David chuckled sheepishly. "She's got a point."

Sophia opened the thermal container. "See what I brought…"

The aroma of rice and meat filled the hospital room.

She had brought enough for both her parents.

Watching them finish the meal finally put her mind at ease.

After cleaning up, she sat by the bed and carefully asked for details about the incident.

Leaving the hospital, Sophia glanced back at the inpatient building.

Her expression turned cold.

She took out her phone and dialed a number.

The call was answered quickly.

Sophia's voice was calm. "We've prepared long enough. It's time to move."

A firm reply came from the other end. "Understood."

…

The studio employees were surprised to see Nina Moore's sudden appearance.

Lulu whispered, "I thought she was on vacation in Australia?"

Manager Omelas shook her head. "Ms. Moore doesn't look well. Everyone, be careful."

Nina Moore closed the curtains as soon as she entered her office.

Her assistant brought hot tea, which she clutched tightly.

As if trying to draw some warmth from it.

The image of Isabella's bleeding head kept flashing in her mind.

She repeatedly told herself it wasn't her fault.

Isabella was the one who rushed over and grabbed the laptop. She was the one who hit the table.

It had nothing to do with her.

Yes, that was it.

Thinking this, she felt slightly reassured.

She lowered her head and took a sip of hot water.

A commotion suddenly erupted outside.

Nina Moore frowned.

These employees were becoming increasingly undisciplined.

She took a deep breath, ready to go out and reprimand them.

As she opened the door, she heard a clear voice. "We are officers from the Lin City Public Security Bureau. Nina Moore is suspected of intentional assault. Please cooperate with our investigation!"

Lulu looked nervously at Manager Omelas.

Manager Omelas silently pointed toward the office.

Police officers quickly flooded into the office.

They surrounded Nina Moore.

"Nina Moore, you are suspected of intentional injury. Please come with us!"

Nina Moore panicked. "No… I'm not going… It has nothing to do with me!"

"The victim has filed a report. The entire incident was captured on surveillance footage. Please cooperate with the investigation!"

Nina Moore was escorted to a police car.

She finally calmed down. "I want to see my lawyer. I have the right to remain silent until then."

Her lawyer arrived the next day.

Nina Moore asked urgently, "When can I get out?"

The lawyer looked troubled. "You might have to stay here for a while."

"Can't I get bail?"

The lawyer shook his head.

He brought worse news. "Isabella Sullivan has decided to sue you."

"Sue me for what?"

"Copyright infringement."

"What evidence does she have? What can she do if I don't admit guilt?"

The lawyer produced a recording.
###Chapter 340

The recording button was pressed.

"Why does Editor Moore sign so many established authors every year?"

"The copyrights for those older books... the operational flexibility is enormous."

"They don't require the author's consent at all."

"The money all goes straight into her own pocket."

Moore's face instantly drained of color.

She recognized her assistant's voice.

"Those traitors!" Her nails dug into her palms. "Where did this recording come from?"

Attorney Wu replied, "Provided by Isabella Sullivan's daughter. Both employees are willing to testify in court."

"They also submitted crucial evidence. The situation looks very bad for you."

Moore had initially thought it would just cost her some money.

She never expected to be sued for infringement directly.

"I paid to sign her, and she bites the hand that feeds me! Attorney Wu, what do we do now?"

Attorney Wu looked her straight in the eye. "I need the truth—did you privately manage the copyrights of works authors created before signing with you?"

Moore's eyes darted away. "Everything was according to the contract—"

"Did you, or did you not?"

Moore bit her lip. Finally, she nodded.

Attorney Wu sucked in a sharp breath. "Have you lost your mind?!"

"I signed them. What's wrong with managing their work? It's not a charity!"

"Copyrights for pre-signing works never belonged to you! That's basic常识!"

Moore scoffed. "Nothing happened all these years. New books? Who can guarantee they'll make money?"

Attorney Wu took a deep breath. "I'll try for an out-of-court settlement. Pay what needs to be paid. Apologize where necessary."

"凭什么?" Moore shot to her feet. "She wants to sue me? Let her! We'll see who breaks first!"

Attorney Wu fell silent.

She was beyond saving.

Sophia Sullivan was peeling an apple in the hospital room when she received the news that Moore had refused the settlement.

"Mom, I need to make a quick call."

Isabella Sullivan smiled and nodded.

Sophia dialed Stone Macmillan's number. "She refused."

Stone sneered. "She won't admit defeat until she's cornered."

Sophia said, "Proceed as planned."

"Understood."

Three days later, Attorney Wu visited the detention center again.

Moore eagerly approached him.

But the news was冰冷. "Your situation has been exposed online. Dozens of authors are filing a joint lawsuit. The evidence is irrefutable. We will lose this case."

Moore trembled. "How... it was only Isabella Sullivan..."

"When you refused the settlement, did you not consider the consequences?"

Dozens of authors...

Massive compensation...

Moore's legs went weak. "Attorney Wu, go tell Isabella Sullivan I agree to settle! Any amount!"

"It's too late. Isabella Sullivan's daughter has explicitly refused any settlement."

Cold sweat poured down Moore's back. "Why..."

"You only get one chance."

Exposed to the entire internet. Ostracized from the industry.

Massive compensation. Financial ruin.

Moore gripped the bars. "Attorney Wu, save me... I know I was wrong..."

Attorney Wu shook his head. "All we can do now is try to minimize the compensation. Avoid jail time."

Jail?

Moore collapsed to the floor.

She finally felt regret.

...

The weather was beautiful the day Isabella was discharged from the hospital.

Sophia greeted her with a bouquet of purple roses. "Congratulations on your discharge."

"Thank you, sweetheart!" Isabella took the flowers, her smile radiant.

David Sullivan had prepared a lavish meal at home.

There was also a basin of fire and mugwort leaves.

"Step over it. Ward off the bad luck. Smooth sailing from now on!"

Isabella found it amusing. "You're making such a fuss."

"Absolutely necessary!"

After the meal, mother and daughter sat chatting in the living room.

Mentioning Moore, Isabella sighed softly, but felt no pity.

If she hadn't reacted quickly that day, her manuscripts would have been completely destroyed.

"Mom, leave this to Stone and me."

"Stone is involved too?"

Sophia nodded.

Stone had obtained the recording.

He had been planning this since Isabella signed the contract.

If Moore had known when to stop, he wouldn't have gone this far.

But Moore insisted on causing trouble.

She left him no choice.

Stone was famously protective of his own in the industry.

He had contacted each of those jointly suing authors personally.

He also funded the lawyers, preparing for a tough battle.
###Chapter 341

With Isabella's matters settled, Sophia Sullivan flew back to Kyoto.

Final exams were approaching, and classes had been suspended for revision week.

Though she had only been gone two days, her coursework was fine, but her experiments had fallen behind.

Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence were waiting for her to review their data. Sophia went straight to the lab from the airport.

She didn't leave for the next two days. Having her luggage with her was convenient.

After clearing the backlog of data, she remembered she still owed Ryan Sullivan and Sebastian Evans the final payment.

That evening, she called them to meet.

They met at the same restaurant near MIT.

Ryan had heard about Isabella from the family and asked a few concerned questions.

Sophia replied, "It's all resolved. I asked you here today mainly to settle the final payment."

"According to the contract, the project fee is paid in three installments. The first two have been transferred. Ryan, you're still owed the final installment. Please verify, and if everything's correct, I'll transfer the funds."

"Mr. Evans, you two communicated directly for most of it. I'm not entirely clear on the details. After I settle with Ryan, you can work it out between yourselves. Since we're all here, it's best to get it sorted now."

Ryan wasn't particularly worried about errors, but seeing Sophia's seriousness, he carefully checked. "It's correct."

"Good."

Next, Ryan and Sebastian settled their accounts.

They were both efficient and straightforward.

With business concluded, they began eating.

Remembering their help, Sophia raised her teacup in a toast. "Ryan, Mr. Evans, the lab wouldn't be built without you. I won't waste words on formalities. It's all in this tea."

Ryan waved his hand with a sheepish grin. "Don't be so formal. I should be thanking you. My company was almost broke recently. I don't know how much longer I could have lasted without your project."

He knew clearly that if he weren't Sophia's cousin, she likely wouldn't have chosen his company without any prior contact.

Sophia smiled. It had been a fortunate coincidence, but Ryan hadn't let her down.

Sebastian didn't speak, merely curling the corner of his mouth slightly.

His long, distinct fingers traced the rim of his cup. His peripheral vision remained fixed on Sophia's profile. Seeing her so happy and spirited softened his heart.

After the meal, Sebastian went to pay the bill.

Sophia visited the restroom. When she returned, Ryan suddenly solemnly pushed a bank card toward her.

"Ryan?"

"Clara, there's 100,000 dollars in this card. It's not much, just the deposit from the last two orders. Please, you must accept it."

Sophia was puzzled. "It's your hard-earned money. Why give it to me?"

"After the lab was completed, many media outlets came. The online discussion blew up, and our company got popular too. Orders haven't stopped since..." Ryan couldn't stop smiling as he spoke.

Recently, the company's front desk phone hadn't stopped ringing. Orders they once begged for were now coming to them.

He finally understood what "traffic is king" meant.

With visibility came more opportunities.

Ryan knew all of this was because of Sophia.

"...In our industry, there's a standard commission for referrals. This is what you deserve."

Sophia naturally refused. "We're family; this is too formal. I won't take the money. Please keep it."

Ryan's smart home installation company's success was closely tied to its cutting-edge positioning and his own hard work.

Ryan directly shoved the card into her hand. "...Then consider it an investment in your project. Building the lab cost so much, and you'll need significant funding later. Think of this 100,000 as my investment share."

Sophia joked half-seriously, "Ryan, you want to invest in all our lab projects for just 100,000? That's too cheap."

Ryan laughed. "How could I dare dream that big? Investing in one is enough!"

With things put that way, Sophia had no choice but to accept.

Ryan could never have imagined how substantial the returns would be from this casually offered 100,000 dollars in the future.

...

With the move to the new lab, the temporary space at Stanford University was no longer needed.

Professor Murphy had kindly lent the lab, likely out of regard for Alexander Laurent, but Sophia was still grateful.

On Saturday, she bought flowers and fruit, and went to return the keys in person, also to express her thanks.

Professor Murphy's office was on the third floor of the Stanford administration building. Sophia had been there twice and knew the way.

She knocked on the door. "Professor Murphy, are you in?"

A voice came from inside quickly. "Come in."

Sophia pushed the door open.

Professor Murphy's office was like him: simple, bright, and straightforward.

Besides a desk and a coffee table, there was a sofa and bookshelf.

A tea set sat on the solid wood coffee table. The tea was hot, its aroma filling the room.

To her surprise, Alexander Laurent was also there.

The tea was probably brewed for him.

"Sophia, you're here."

"Professor Laurent, Professor Murphy, good morning! Have you both had lunch?" Sophia arranged the flowers and placed the fruit on a nearby table.

"I've eaten. You really didn't need to bring anything."

Sophia said, "It's just flowers and some fruit, nothing expensive. You lent me your lab without charging. I should return the kindness."

"Haha..." Professor Murphy laughed heartily. "You're something else, young lady. Always so quick with words. I can't refuse, I really can't."

"Then please accept them." Sophia nodded earnestly.

"Alex, see how this girl knows how to climb the ladder offered? Not humble at all!"

Alexander curled his lips. "Really? I find her quite懂事 and thoughtful."

This praise immediately made Sophia blush bright red.

Who praises someone to their face like that?

It was awkward to feel either shy or pleased, and refusing would be even more improper. It was just uncomfortable!

If he wanted to praise her, why not do it behind her back...

Sophia couldn't help thinking.

Professor Murphy agreed, "That's true. Otherwise, how could she have all our Stanford young men lining up for her?"

Alexander's smile faded slightly.

Sophia grew even more embarrassed.

Finally, Alexander spoke to change the subject for her. "You came today to...?"

"Oh, I came to return the keys. Thank you, Professor Murphy, for lending us the lab during this time."

She took out the keys and placed them on the table.

"I'll let you two continue your conversation. I won't disturb you further. Goodbye." Sophia tactfully took her leave.

No sooner had she left than Alexander also stood up. "Professor Murphy, if there's nothing else, I'll be going too."

"Wait, weren't we going to discuss the research direction for next year's international joint project?"

Alexander said, "It's too complex to settle now. We'll talk another time."

Professor Murphy stared blankly at his hurriedly departing back. Wasn't that the whole reason for his visit today?

How was it suddenly "too complex"?

...

"Sophia—"

Alexander caught up to her.

"Professor?" Sophia turned around. "You're done already?"

"Yes, we finished talking."

It was fortunate Professor Murphy wasn't there to hear. If he were, he'd surely be baffled: Finished talking? Talked about what?
###Chapter 342

Alexander Laurent set down the file in his hand.

"Have you had lunch?"

Sophia Sullivan shook her head.

"Not yet."

Alexander chuckled softly.

"Perfect. I haven't eaten either."

Their eyes met.

A silent understanding hung in the air.

Half an hour later—

The barbecue restaurant was filled with smoke and sizzling sounds.

Alexander picked up a slice of pork belly.

The fat crackled on the hot grill.

He carefully turned the meat.

Until the edges were slightly crisp.

He wrapped it neatly in a lettuce leaf.

Then offered it to Sophia.

She was typing a message on her phone.

She looked up, slightly startled.

"Professor, I can do it myself…"

Alexander didn't withdraw his hand.

"Open your mouth."

Sophia froze.

Amusement sparkled in Alexander's eyes.

"Your hands just touched your phone. Are you sure you want to handle food with them?"

Sophia immediately put her phone down.

"I'm finished replying."

She reached out to take the wrapped meat.

Alexander placed it on her plate instead.

"Wipe your hands first."

Sophia looked at her fingers.

They had indeed just been on her phone.

She smiled sheepishly.

From then on, Alexander took charge of the grilling.

Sophia focused on eating.

He continuously placed perfectly cooked meat onto her plate.

Sophia finally spoke up.

"Professor, don't just focus on me."

Alexander nodded.

"Alright."

But her plate remained full.

A piece of beef scalded the tip of her tongue.

Sophia inhaled sharply.

Alexander handed her a glass of iced coconut milk.

"Drink it slowly."

The cool liquid soothed the sting.

Alexander asked with concern.

"Feeling better?"

Sophia nodded.

"My tongue is still a bit numb."

"Let me see. Open your mouth."

His tone was so natural.

Sophia instinctively stuck out her tongue.

A few seconds later, she realized what she'd done.

Her cheeks flushed instantly.

She immediately sat up straight.

Alexander examined it carefully.

"The mucosa is a bit red, but not broken."

"Some cold drink will help."

Sophia murmured her thanks.

She gulped down two mouthfuls of ice water to cool her face.

She pointed to some mushrooms on the grill.

"What are these?"

Alexander picked up a few.

"King trumpet mushrooms."

"They look so small…"

Alexander placed them on her plate.

"Hmm."

Sophia looked up.

Alexander was watching her.

"They are indeed very cute."

Sophia was stunned.

She had been talking about the mushrooms.

Yet her face grew warm nonetheless.

…

The meal lasted until two in the afternoon.

Alexander had no urgent matters.

Sophia had been relatively free lately.

They strolled along the street.

The winter sun was unusually warm.

The streets near Stanford University were complex and winding.

Bustling with life.

Besides restaurants and food stalls.

There were also vendors selling handicrafts.

Sophia examined each one with curiosity.

Occasionally picking up a small item for a closer look.

Alexander followed behind her.

His gaze never leaving her.

Time seemed to turn sweet.

Every second made his heart beat faster.

This novel feeling.

Was something he'd never experienced in his twenty-eight years.

He wanted to resist it, yet couldn't break free.

It felt like something was sprouting deep in his heart.

About to break through the soil.

"Professor, look at this—"

Sophia suddenly waved him over.

Alexander collected his thoughts and approached.

Sophia pointed at a clay figurine.

"What do you think this looks like?"

Alexander studied it carefully.

The figurine had only a vague humanoid shape.

Devoid of any details.

He answered honestly.

"Can't tell. It's sculpted too abstractly."

The other clay figures on the stall shared the same style.

Each uniquely ugly.

The stall seemed unattended.

Only a phone on a stand faced away from them.

Sophia pondered for a moment.

"From this angle, it looks a bit like Cupid?"

As soon as she spoke.

A young man suddenly popped up from behind the stall.

"You actually recognized it!"

The man's eyes shone with excitement.

He had finally found a kindred spirit.

Sophia was surprised.

"It really is Cupid?"

The man nodded repeatedly.

"You're the first person to recognize my work!"

Sophia said tactfully.

"Although the shape and features are a bit abstract…"

The man's expression instantly darkened.

"Are you here to cause trouble?"

Sophia was speechless.

Alexander added calmly.

"She's not wrong. It is very abstract."

The man was rendered silent.

But the live stream chat was roaring with laughter.

[This girl is so blunt!]

[Zack's confidence took another hit]

[This couple is so good-looking!]

…

The vendor, Zack, wanted to keep them.

"Let me sculpt a double portrait of you two?"

Sophia declined.

"No, thank you."

"Why not?"

"I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to show my face afterward."

Zack was stumped.

The live stream erupted in laughter again.

Zack refused to back down.

"I'm really good at double portraits!"

Sophia looked at him skeptically.

"Can someone who doesn't eat green onions finish a whole bowl of them?"

Zack had no retort.

[She's a logical genius!]

Zack rolled up his sleeves.

"Today, I'm going to show you my skills!"

"For free!"

Sophia became interested.

"Alright."

Zack directed them to pose.

"Move your heads closer."

"A little closer."

"Turn your heads slightly."

Sophia and Alexander turned at the same time.

Their noses touched.

Their lips brushed lightly against each other.
###Chapter 343

Sorry.

My apologies.

They both stepped back simultaneously.

Their eyes met, freezing the air between them.

Sophia Sullivan pressed her lips together.

Alexander Laurent lowered his gaze.

"Professor, you go first."

Alexander lifted his eyes, his gaze deep and intense.

His Adam's apple bobbed slightly. "Sophia, actually—"

"All done!" The stall owner's booming voice cut in.

Sophia's cheeks flushed hot. She turned away quickly.

"So fast?"

The stall owner puffed his chest out. "Piece of cake."

He held the clay sculpture out to her.

Sophia took one look and froze.

The sculpture had no facial features.

Just two blurry humanoid outlines, their heads pressed together.

Wait.

This pose…

"What… what is this?"

"You two! A kissing pose! Look at the heads, the necks, the lips pressed together…"

Sophia's ears burned crimson.

Alexander turned his face away, clearing his throat softly.

Stall Owner: "Still can't see? Let me show you—"

"No need!" Sophia interrupted hastily. "I see it clearly."

"Really see it?"

"Really."

The stall owner pumped his fist excitedly. "Told you I could do it!"

Live stream comments flooded the screen.

[The lady is visibly panicking]

[Hang, just shut up already]

[She's about to crawl into a hole from embarrassment]

[Help, this is so awkward]

"It's yours." The stall owner offered the sculpture.

Sophia took half a step back. "N-no, thank you."

"Why not? You said it looked like you earlier."

Alexander reached out. "I'll take it."

Sophia grabbed his arm and pulled him away.

The stall owner stood there, sculpture held aloft, bewildered.

He leaned toward his phone. "Why run? Is a ghost chasing you?"

[Hang, wake up!]

[Kissing pose so detailed, yet zero facial features]

[Innocent Hang doesn't understand love]

The stall owner was about to retort when a voice came from behind.

"Give me the sculpture."

Alexander had returned.

He scanned a payment code.

The stall owner was stunned. "Didn't you guys run off?"

"Yes."

"You think I did a good job too?" The stall owner's eyes lit up.

Alexander's lips curved slightly. "Excellent."

The stall owner excitedly packaged it up.

Alexander carefully accepted the box.

"Welcome back anytime!"

The stall owner preened for the camera. "See! The customer is so satisfied!"

[The handsome guy likes the lady, not the sculpture!]

[So he came back specifically to buy it?]

[These two haven't confessed yet, have they?]

[Nailed it]

...

Sophia saw Alexander return, a paper bag now in his hand.

"What's that?"

"Just a small thing I picked up."

She didn't think much of it.

They walked through the pedestrian street.

Sophia checked the time. 4 PM.

Alexander spoke up. "I have a conference in Hainan in a few days. I need a lightweight suit. There's a mall ahead. Could you help me pick one out?"

"Sure."

The men's section was on the fifth floor.

The elevator doors opened. Sophia saw a familiar back.

"Mr. Valdemar?"

Sebastian Evans turned.

His eyes brightened upon seeing Sophia, then dimmed slightly when he noticed Alexander.

"What a coincidence." He smiled. "What brings you two here?"

"Helping the professor pick a suit. And you?"

"Buying shoes for my father, but I'm not great at choosing." He gave a light, helpless laugh. "Could you offer some advice? The old man would be delighted knowing you helped pick them."

Sophia thought of the kind Isaac Atlante and nodded in agreement.

The duo became a trio.

Sophia walked in the middle, flanked by two tall, handsome men, drawing countless glances.

She stopped.

"Suits and dress shoes are from different brands. Why don't you each decide on your usual brands first? Then I can help with the styles."

It would be more efficient.

Alexander and Sebastian exchanged a look, reaching a silent agreement.

Sebastian went to look at shoes. Sophia started helping Alexander choose a suit.

She selected three simple, classic styles.

Alexander changed into the suit. His posture was ramrod straight, more striking than any model.

All three suits fit him perfectly.

Sophia held the jackets up against him, comparing, unable to decide.

The gray was stately, the blue refined, the charcoal sophisticated.

"Which one do you prefer, Professor?" she asked, looking up.
###Chapter 344
Alexander Laurent considered for a moment.

"Gray."

Sophia Sullivan's eyes lit up.

It was just as she had thought!

Alexander nodded to the salesperson. "This set. I'll take it."

He changed back into his own clothes.

Sophia pointed to his collar. "This isn't folded right."

He adjusted it.

It still wasn't lying flat.

Sophia reached out and fixed it for him.

The man was very tall.

She had to rise onto her toes.

The distance between them closed instantly.

They were close enough to feel each other's breath.

The faint scent of her perfume drifted over.

Alexander's heart skipped a beat.

His Adam's apple bobbed slightly.

He could feel it clearly.

Those slender hands were adjusting his collar.

Her warm fingertips occasionally brushed against his skin.

Sending a faint, electric tingle through him.

...

Sylvia Laurent had plans for dinner.

It was still early.

She decided to browse the mall first.

After buying her own things, she had the driver take them to the car.

She went up to the fifth floor alone.

She intended to buy something for Frederick and her three sons.

What else could she do when her husband and sons were all bachelors?

She browsed several stores but didn't see anything suitable.

She was gradually losing interest.

She was walking aimlessly.

Suddenly, a suit in a window display caught her eye.

She stopped to take a closer look.

Then, through the glass, she saw two people inside the store.

Wasn't that her youngest son, Alexander?

And there was a woman with him!

Sylvia stared, frozen in place.

What shocked her even more was when the woman turned around.

Revealing a familiar face.

It was that Sophia Sullivan from the tea ceremony class!

Sylvia instinctively moved closer for a better look.

Her nose smacked hard into the glass.

The pain made her gasp.

Now she had to accept reality.

The woman with Alexander was indeed Sophia Sullivan!

Previous suspicions flooded her mind.

She had seen her in the building where her son rented an apartment.

Her son eating alone but with two sets of utensils.

An extra lunchbox suddenly appearing in the kitchen.

A storm of doubt and alarm rose within Sylvia.

Was her son already dating this woman?

How serious was it?

Did she have ulterior motives?

Countless questions swirled in her head.

A sense of losing control enveloped her.

Sylvia quietly hid to the side to continue observing.

"All done, Professor."

Sophia withdrew her hand and took a step back.

Alexander thanked her quietly.

The salesperson handed over the packaged suit. "Your clothes and card, sir."

Alexander took them.

They left the store together.

"Thank you, please come again—"

Afraid of being seen, Sylvia quickly ducked into a fire stairwell.

When she peeked out again, they were already gone.

She stamped her foot in frustration.

The impact jarred her ankle painfully.

Even her shoes were against her!

...

Sylvia couldn't find them because they had entered a shoe store next door.

Sebastian Evans was waiting on a sofa.

His long legs were crossed as he played on his phone.

He looked up and saw Sophia enter.

A smile immediately appeared on his face.

Sophia carefully selected the leather shoes.

She considered both comfort and style.

Remembering the elderly gentleman with the cane.

Impeccably dressed in a waistcoat.

Exuding a British gentleman's aura.

He likely had exacting tastes.

She chose with extra care.

Alexander went to the restroom midway.

Sophia quickly picked out two pairs.

"I think these two are both good. Which one would you prefer, Sebastian?"

Sebastian directly pulled out his card. "We'll take both. Grandpa will love anything you choose."

Sophia was skeptical. "Is it that simple?"

"You'll know when you meet them yourself one day."

"I'd like to visit. They seemed very kind..."

Sebastian's gaze softened.

While the salesperson was packing the shoes, Sebastian poured Sophia a cup of tea.

Noticing the water was cold, he asked for hot water.

Only then did he hand it to her.

"Have some hot tea."

"Thank you." Sophia took the cup.

Her eyes were still on the shelves.

She wanted to buy a pair for David Sullivan too.

Sebastian watched her. "More water?"

Sophia shook her head. "No, thank you."

He stood up and took the empty cup from her.

This scene was witnessed by Irene Valdemar as she passed by.

She first raised an eyebrow but wasn't particularly surprised.

She knew her son had his fun over the years.

Sebastian had good judgment; he played around but never got serious.

So she, as his mother, never interfered much.

He probably had a new girlfriend again.

Irene paused, then stepped back outside the store.

She didn't plan to disturb her son.

But the next scene surprised her.

Her usually proud son was personally pouring tea for a woman.

He considerately handed it to her.

And took the empty cup from her after she finished.

Such an attentive, gentle attitude.

It was completely unlike the Sebastian she knew!

Irene couldn't help but frown.

Playing was fine, but getting serious was not.

She scrutinized the woman.

Sebastian's body blocked the view, making her features unclear.

But her figure and bearing were outstanding.

Her dress sense was also very tasteful.

Irene checked the time.

Remembering her appointment, she turned to leave.

She trusted her son knew which women were for marrying.

And which were only for fun.

...

Irene arrived at the restaurant.

She found Sylvia was already there.

Staring blankly into space.

She sat down and teased, "Who upset you?"

Sylvia jolted back to reality. "When did you get here? You scared me. It's nothing..."

"That sounds fake. Let's order and talk over food."

The food arrived quickly.

But Sylvia had little appetite. "I just saw my son with a woman."

"What a coincidence? I saw my son with a woman too."

"?"
###Chapter 345
Still Denying She's a Gold Digger?

Irene Valdemar stood up to pay the bill.

The table was still laden with nearly untouched dishes.

Both mothers were preoccupied with their own thoughts.

Sebastian Evans and Alexander Laurent, however, had fruitful outings.

One bought a suit, the other purchased dress shoes.

Sebastian pointed into the distance. "There's a bubble tea shop up ahead."

Alexander spoke at the same time. "That patisserie is quite famous."

Their eyes met, a silent challenge passing between them.

Sebastian smiled. "Sophia, care to join me?"

Alexander asked gently. "Would you like to go in and see?"

Both pairs of eyes turned to Sophia Sullivan.

Sophia froze.

Not again!

"You two go ahead. I need to use the restroom."

Sebastian nodded. "Alright."

He turned to Alexander. "I assume a professor wouldn't drink bubble tea?"

Alexander replied smoothly. "If you're buying, Sebastian, I might try some."

Sebastian gritted his teeth. "Fine."

Alexander smiled. "My treat for the cake then."

Sebastian's expression darkened further.

They went to stand in their respective lines.

When Sophia emerged from the restroom, Sebastian was holding two cups of bubble tea.

A third cup sat on the table.

He was asking a server for a carrier bag.

Sophia reached out. "I can take them."

They walked toward the patisserie, chatting.

"...Sylvia? Sylvia!"

"...What?"

"What has you so captivated?" Irene followed her gaze, seeing only a cake shop.

Sylvia Laurent waved a hand. "It's nothing."

But her face had instantly turned grim.

That scheming girl was with another man.

They were laughing and sharing a drink.

That was clearly something only couples did!

She only saw the man's back, but his clothes and bearing were exceptional.

Just this morning, she was shopping for clothes with her son, and by afternoon she was latching onto another man.

And she still denied being a gold digger!

Her time management was impressive.

The thought of her naive son being deceived by such a woman made Sylvia's heart ache.

"Irene, something urgent came up. I have to go."

"It's fine. I should be heading back too."

Sylvia hurried away.

Inside the patisserie—

"Sophia! Over here!" Alexander waved from in front of the refrigerated display case.

Sophia walked over and handed him a tea. "Professor, this is for you."

"Thank you." Alexander glanced at Sebastian, a slight smile touching his lips. "Thank you for your generosity, Sebastian."

Sebastian snorted. "Don't mention it."

Alexander pointed to the case. "Which one would you like?"

Sophia chose a peach-shaped cake.

"And you, Sebastian?"

Sebastian didn't care for sweets, but since Alexander was paying, he had to have one—

"The same as Sophia."

The clerk looked apologetic. "I'm sorry, each design is unique. We only have one of each."

Sebastian pointed at random.

When the clerk handed it to him, he realized it was shaped like a cartoon butt.

At a glance, it did somewhat resemble a peach.

Alexander chuckled softly. "You have... unique taste, Sebastian."

Sebastian's face fell.

Sophia, distracted by another display, missed their exchange.

After Alexander paid, he found Sophia staring at a fondant cake in the exhibition case.

It was five tiers high, each adorned with intricate figurines.

"Beautiful, isn't it?"

"Exquisite." Sophia pointed to the second tier. "This one, with glasses and a frown, looks a bit like you, Professor."

Alexander studied it. "Not really. I rarely frown."

Sophia blinked. "Maybe you just don't realize it? Like right now."

Alexander paused, feeling strangely flustered.

Sophia couldn't help but laugh. "Professor, you're actually quite cute."

The three left the patisserie. Alexander's phone rang—

"Mother."

"Alexander, come home immediately." Sylvia's voice was stern.

"What's wrong?"

"We'll discuss it when you get here."

"...Alright."

He ended the call, concern etching his features. "Something came up at home. I have to go."

Sophia was about to nod when Sebastian's phone also rang. "...Understood."

He put his phone away. "What a coincidence. Family matter for me too. But I'll see Sophia home first. You go ahead, Professor."

Sophia quickly waved her hands. "No need. It's only a ten-minute walk."

She turned to Sebastian. "You should go handle your business. Don't delay because of me."

Sebastian and Alexander exchanged a look, neither yielding.

Finally, urged on by Sophia, they both left.

Sophia let out a long sigh of relief.

Peace and quiet at last.

Shopping with them was more exhausting than running experiments.

Never getting involved in something like this again.

So draining.

...

Alexander drove home at high speed.

But everything seemed calm.

Knowing his mother's temperament, he patiently inquired.

Sylvia studied him for a long moment.

"...Mother, what is it? Is everything really alright at home?"

Alexander frowned in thought.

His eldest brother was on a business trip abroad.

His second brother had taken on a new case, but it should be fine.

His father was living a life of leisure.

What could have made his mother so anxious?

"Everything's fine at home. Your brothers don't worry me. It's you. Buried in your research all day. Have you given any thought to what we discussed last time?"

Sylvia took a deep breath, choosing a roundabout approach.

Alexander was puzzled. "Discussed what?"

"Your Uncle Jiang's youngest daughter, remember? The one who always followed you around calling you 'big brother' when you were kids. They immigrated over a decade ago and just returned last week. Your Uncle Jiang wants our families to get together. You..."
###Chapter 346

"Mom!" Alexander Laurent cut her off. "I've said I'm not considering that right now."

Sylvia Laurent stared at him. "Are you seeing someone?"

Alexander froze.

Sophia Sullivan's face flashed through his mind.

He shook his head. "No."

Sylvia didn't believe him. "Then what about the suit? You bought it alone?"

Alexander glanced down at the paper bag. "How did you know it was a suit?"

Sylvia's eyes flickered.

"The logo is obvious. They only make suits. Don't change the subject. Answer me."

His tone was flat. "A friend helped me choose it."

"A friend? Male or female? What friend?" Sylvia pressed.

"Mom, is this why you called me back today?" Alexander frowned. "If there's nothing else, I need to return to the lab."

Sylvia studied him for a long moment.

His expression was neutral, giving nothing away.

She was about to speak when Frederick Laurent set down his teacup.

"Enough. Our son is busy. He came back specifically for you. Know when to stop."

Sylvia suppressed her anxiety.

She couldn't let that tea master keep stringing her son along.

It was utterly maddening!

...

The Valdemar residence.

Irene Valdemar had also summoned her son home.

She was more composed than Sylvia.

She got straight to the point. "Changed your companion recently?"

The word "companion" was uttered lightly.

Sebastian Evans raised an eyebrow. "Suddenly interested in my love life?"

Irene devoted most of her energy to her husband and social engagements.

This unusual concern surprised him.

Irene laughed without humor. "Can't I care about my own son?"

"Of course you can," Sebastian nodded. "Whatever makes you happy."

"So it's true?"

"She's not a companion."

Irene paused. "...What does that mean?"

"Exactly what it sounds like. Not a companion. A woman I'm seriously pursuing."

"And she hasn't agreed yet?"

Sebastian shook his head. "Not yet."

Irene was surprised. "There's someone you can't win over?"

"Correction: 'hasn't agreed yet,' not 'can't win over.' Don't jinx me."

Irene's heart sank, but her expression remained light. "You're serious?"

Sebastian: "I'm always serious."

Irene couldn't smile.

Most second-generation heirs in their circle were disappointments. Her son was the exception.

Brilliant and strong-willed since childhood, with a daring streak.

He ventured into investments, finance, and started his own company as an adult.

Though not entirely self-made, he was exceptionally capable.

His only fault was his frequent change of female companions.

Approaching thirty and still not settled.

But it didn't hinder his outstanding career.

Irene never interfered with Sebastian's relationships.

She knew they were just for fun, posing no threat.

Which young heir wasn't a bit wild?

Play was play, but he mustn't get trapped.

Some things were hard for Irene to say directly.

She could only hint vaguely. "Be careful with matters between men and women. Don't take it lightly just because you're experienced. Be careful not to get hurt."

Sebastian was puzzled. "Mom, what are you trying to say?"

Irene didn't elaborate further. Instead, she brought up another matter. "I contacted Dr. Chang a few days ago. He said Grandma's eyes and health have improved significantly. Arrange a time. I want to see them."

Dr. Chang was the head of ophthalmology at the Valdemar hospital, Florence Atlante's primary physician.

Irene had long informed the hospital to notify her when the old lady improved.

"Before, you said Grandma was unwell and couldn't be upset, so I shouldn't visit. Now the doctor says she's better. What reason do you have to stop me now?"

Irene looked at Sebastian, having anticipated this.

Sebastian hesitated, choosing his words carefully. "Grandma's health has improved, but her spirits are still low. Stress could cause a setback. It's best not to disturb her..."

"What stimulation could seeing her own daughter cause?" Irene's agitation flared instantly. "I am her daughter! Her only daughter! Decades have passed. Why can't she understand?!"

"Mom—"

"I think she's not just blind in the eyes, but in her heart too! All these years, who has cared for her? Who has worked tirelessly for her? And her?" Irene spoke through gritted teeth, filled with anger and resentment. "She only remembers Emilia!"

"Dead! That person has been dead for years! Turned to ashes! Why can't the old lady understand?!"

That person, a lingering ghost!

"Mom! You're going too far!" Sebastian's face turned cold.

Whenever Emilia was mentioned, his mother's rationality and elegance vanished.

Her loss of composure was rather unseemly.

"Sebastian, I really don't understand. Help me think? They wanted for nothing. Holidays, calls, gifts—I never missed a thing. I was careful in everything, cautious everywhere, afraid of failing in my duty as a daughter. And the result? Calls ignored, gifts returned, treated like an enemy when we meet! They never truly considered me their daughter! And now you say I'm going too far?!"

Irene grew more agitated as she spoke. She stood up abruptly and paced back and forth in the living room.

She muttered to herself, "Haven't I done enough? Why won't they forgive me after all these years? Was Emilia that perfect? She was willful and spoiled. Where did I fall short? Is it just because of blood?"

"Is an adopted daughter not as dear as a biological one? Then why adopt me in the first place? Why give me a home if the love wasn't equal?"

Sebastian watched calmly as she complained, grew angry, raged, and became anxious.

He remained silent.

Only when she showed pain, nearing collapse, did he speak quietly. "Two went out together. Only one came back. How do you expect Grandfather and Grandmother to accept that? How can they forgive?"

Irene froze completely.
###Chapter 347

Memories flooded back.

Fragmented images flashed through her mind.

Irene Valdemar remembered those tear-filled eyes.

They had appeared in her nightmares countless times.

Her voice was hoarse. "Emilia's kidnapping was done by rivals."

"Why blame me?"

"Just because I went out with her that day?"

"Is that fair?"

Her eyes were vacant. "If I had been the one taken."

"Would I be the one remembered now?"

Tears streamed down continuously.

She sank into deep self-blame.

Sebastian Evans watched his mother.

His heart softened eventually.

Remembering his grandmother's recent interest.

He suggested softly. "Grandma has become obsessed with a mystery novel lately."

"It's called 'The Seven-Day Tale'."

"If we could get a signed copy from the author."

"Especially a personalized one."

"She would be very happy."

Irene's eyes immediately lit up.

He quickly added. "You know Grandma's temperament."

"It's best to take it step by step."

"Tell me first after you get the book."

"I'll arrange it."

To avoid backfiring.

"Got it, got it." Irene couldn't wait.

Wasn't it just a signed book?

Anything money could solve wasn't a problem.

Sebastian hesitated to speak.

He ultimately chose silence.

His assistant called about urgent documents.

He hurried to the company.

Irene summoned the butler.

"Find me a copy of 'The Seven-Day Tale'."

"I want the author's personal signature."

"Preferably a personalized one."

"Spend whatever it takes to get it."

The butler asked cautiously. "What should the personalized message say?"

Irene thought for a moment. "Just write some blessings."

"Good health and long life."

Elderly people loved hearing such things.

The butler nodded and noted it down.

He immediately set to work.

...

The end of the semester approached.

The Plant Quarantine course had a practical exam.

This time, it wasn't a written test.

It was a field specimen collection.

Grades were based on collection results.

This counted as the final grade.

Sophia Sullivan was in a group with Marcus Lawrence and Hannah Morse.

The teacher notified the meeting location in the group chat.

Sophia arrived fifteen minutes early.

Only a few scattered students were at the school gate.

The college had arranged five buses.

The first four had already departed.

The last one was for first-year graduate students.

Classmates arrived one after another.

Marcus was still on his way.

Hannah habitually arrived at the last minute.

Sophia looked down at her watch.

She occasionally glanced up searching for her companions.

Her gaze collided with someone else's in the crowd.

Cool peach-blossom eyes held a probing look.

Sophia was slightly taken aback.

Across the crowd.

Fiona Valentine gave her a polite smile.

Ashley Lowell and Amelia Roscente surrounded her.

They seemed to be asking something.

Ashley's attitude was aloof.
###Chapter 348

Rare

Shane Holloway stood by the RV holding a water kettle, his face plastered with an ingratiating smile.

Jude Granger followed behind, laden with numerous bags.

Sophia Sullivan glanced at them briefly before looking away.

She was never close with Fiona Valentine to begin with.

"Hannah!" Hannah Morse called out as she ran over from a distance, waving vigorously.

A large, overstuffed backpack was slung over her shoulders, looking quite heavy.

It was crammed with sunscreen, mosquito repellent, hats, bottled water, and the essential snacks.

Hannah grinned, her eyes crinkling. "I brought tons of snacks to share later~"

Sophia nodded. "Okay."

"Huh? Is Marcus Lawrence not here yet?" Hannah panted, catching her breath. "I ran all the way here and I'm still five minutes early."

Marcus, who had arrived earlier, spoke coolly. "What gave you the confidence to assume I'd be later than you?"

Hannah pouted. "Only two minutes early. No need to be so smug. I just overslept a little. But... why are your bags so small?"

Sophia's backpack was lightweight and convenient. Marcus only carried a small travel bag that looked nearly empty.

"The botanical base has excellent facilities. I only brought the essentials," Sophia explained.

Marcus had the same idea.

Hannah fell silent.

So she was the only one foolish enough to carry a huge bag, half-filled with snacks?

At exactly eight o'clock, the faculty began taking attendance.

Once everyone was accounted for, they lined up to board the coach.

Their destination was a botanical garden over a hundred kilometers away in the suburbs, a three-hour drive.

On the bus, Hannah sat with Sophia. Marcus took a seat directly behind them.

The route wound through mountainous switchbacks where the signal was terrible, making phones unusable.

Marcus took out his Kindle and began reading a research paper.

Hannah, being very sociable, chatted animatedly with nearby classmates, various pieces of gossip flowing nonstop.

With nothing else to do, Sophia rested her chin on her hand and admired the scenery outside.

The morning peaks rolled into the distance. Winter days dawned late; even after traveling for a while, the sky was only just beginning to lighten.

Morning mist still clung to the slopes like white silk ribbons.

The sun was on the verge of rising, the sky gradually brightening. It looked like it would be a clear day.

Sophia watched the landscape pass by until the coach arrived at the botanical garden base.

The base was divided into four main zones: A, B, C, and D. Each zone was further subdivided into smaller areas cultivating different plant species.

After assembling at the main gate, each group checked in and dropped off their luggage.

The exam lasted two days and one night. The submission deadline was five PM the next day.

Finding the ten basic task specimens would secure an 80 on the final exam.

Each rare plant specimen found would add an extra 20 points.

This was the equivalent of "mandatory questions" and "bonus questions."

Completing the former would yield a good grade. The latter was optional; it was fine if you couldn't find any.

Passing was guaranteed anyway.

After storing their luggage, Sophia's group of three set off immediately.

Hannah asked, "Which zone should we start with?"

Marcus took out his phone and checked the list of ten basic specimens assigned to their group. "Half are subtropical plants."

Hannah said, "Subtropical... then let's start with Zone D."

"Okay."

By one PM, they had finished searching Zone D and successfully found the corresponding plant specimens.

Without pause, the three hurried to the adjacent Zone B.

They were equally successful there, finishing in just an hour.

Finally, in Zone C, they located the last plant specimen.

Hannah spread her hands. "That's it? We finished the answers in one afternoon! I don't get why the teacher scheduled a full day and night."

She pulled out a bag of chips from her pack, munching on them while offering some to the others. "Want some?"

Marcus took a piece with reserved politeness. "You only want an 80?"

"Isn't 80 good? It's 20 points above passing!"

Marcus fell silent.

Sophia said, "We still have plenty of time. Let's look for some rare plants."

Who wouldn't want a perfect score?

Hannah cheered, "Yeah! Honestly, I don't really care about 100 or 80. I just want to hang out with you guys~"

After a short break, the three set off again.

There was no fixed list for rare plants; it was an open-ended question. Any plant generally recognized as uncommon would count.

But this time, it wasn't going as smoothly.

Dusk fell, and the sky grew dark.

Hannah was panting, exhausted. "...We've searched over a dozen sub-areas, right? Haven't even seen a hint of a rare plant. How long is this going to take? I'm so hungry, I want to eat..."

Lately, she'd been dragged by Marcus to run early in the morning. Whether it was the increased exertion or something else, she got hungry more easily than before.

Her legs felt like jelly; she really couldn't walk anymore.

Sophia was also very tired.

But there were only two small sub-areas left in this large zone. They could finish before dark, exclude this zone tomorrow, and still have enough time.

"Just a bit longer. We can cover the last two sub-areas in Zone A before it gets completely dark. They're right ahead."

"Only two left?"

"Mm."

"Then I won't rest. I'm coming too! We're at the final step of a long march. I'd slap myself if I gave up now. Let's go—"

She made to stand up.

"Not so fast," Sophia pressed her back down. "Rest for two more minutes. Have some water and a snack."

"Okay!" Hannah's eyes lit up. "Sophia, you're the best~"

As she spoke, her recently lifted bottom settled firmly back down.

Sophia was speechless.

Marcus was also speechless.

However, she hadn't been sitting long before Hannah noticed something odd.

"Don't you guys feel like it's getting hotter?"

Sophia looked around, clearly sensing the abnormality too.

The plant growth here was exceptionally lush. Remembering the base's entry manual, she had a guess.

"We must be in the tropical plant zone now."

They had passed through the climate-controlled plant zones at noon. Now, after crossing half the mountain, arriving at a special zone was normal.

Marcus said, "If I'm not mistaken, this area should have a special temperature control system to create a specific environment. Like the camphor trees and banana plants we saw earlier are common subtropical trees."

These ordinary trees were very common; they just hadn't paid much attention.

Hannah asked, "The entry manual mentioned the tropical zone has rhododendrons, right? There are so many types. Could we find an uncommon variety? Would that count as rare?"

Sophia explained, "There are many species of rhododendron, over a thousand documented. The most common is the large-leaf rhododendron, seen in most tropical areas; it's not rare. The tree rhododendron is rarer, currently only growing in the Gongshan mountains of Yunnan. If we could find a tree rhododendron, that should count as a rare plant."

Yunnan was over five thousand meters away, a high-altitude region with many undeveloped natural forest areas. It was said even endangered South China tigers lived there...

This was just a cultivated botanical base. Such large, rare trees... were probably very hard to come by.

Hannah was a little disappointed. "Okay, I was overthinking it."

Sophia smiled without comment and continued following the trail downward.

Pushing through the shrubs ahead, a wave of humid air hit her face.

There must be a water source further ahead. Carefully avoiding the prickly vines, about ten meters from the water, deep in the dense woods, she unexpectedly discovered—
###Chapter 349

A vast grove of Entada phaseoloides!

Sophia Sullivan's eyes lit up.

She waved to the others behind her.

"Come look! Entada phaseoloides!"

Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence hurried over at her call.

Entada phaseoloides is a famous leguminous plant.

Native to Taiwan.

Later introduced to the mainland.

Also known as the Dragon Vine.

Or Ox Eye.

It often grows in mountain streams or mixed forests on slopes.

It climbs up large trees.

Marcus looked up.

Thick, twisted branches coiled around each other.

Its roots can stretch over fifty meters to reach water.

Sprawling across the mountain forest.

Like a colossal beast.

He was first amazed.

Then delighted.

"The pods can be up to a meter long."

"They can be used medicinally or collected."

"Quite valuable on the market."

"Extremely rare."

Sophia nodded.

"This grove is large."

"Finding the pods won't be easy."

"The sun is setting soon."

"Let's split up."

"Meet back here at six."

Hannah and Marcus agreed.

The forest was deep and vast.

Worried about getting lost.

Sophia established a marking system in advance.

They agreed on a cross as the marker.

The three split up.

The pods are flat.

Seeds are enclosed inside.

Nearly round.

Dark brown.

Easy to identify.

Sophia headed west from the water source.

The light in the forest gradually dimmed.

Until it vanished.

She finally found a seed.

Unfortunately, the pod was intact and beautiful.

Too big and long.

Over a meter by eye.

Impossible to carry.

Pods are traded as collectibles on the market.

Their price far exceeds that of seeds.

More precious.

It was now dark.

Sophia followed the markers back.

It was fine at first.

After passing two connected dense woods.

The markers disappeared!

She didn't want to believe it but had to accept it.

She was lost!

Her first instinct was to pull out her phone for help.

No signal.

Adding insult to injury.

Dark clouds gathered overhead.

It was about to rain.

Anxious, she pressed on.

She patiently retraced her steps.

Searching for the cross markers as she went.

The dense forest was like a maze.

One wrong turn.

Led to more mistakes.

She remembered there was signal where they separated.

It was completely dark now.

Her phone was the only light source.

The battery was dying.

Continuing to search for markers now was unwise.

But she couldn't just do nothing.

Sophia began using other methods to find her way.

The orientation of leaves.

The position of stars.

By the phone's faint light.

She watched for raised roots on the ground.

Careful not to get scratched.

The going was tough.

The wind blew.

Leaves rustled.

Like beasts poised to strike from the void.

As if they would pounce any second.

Her phone battery warned again.

20% remaining.

She took a deep breath.

Any more delay.

The phone would die.

Her situation would worsen.

Sophia quickened her pace.

After nearly half an hour.

She passed through a patch of trees.

She felt something above her.

Looking up.

A banana leaf, twice a person's height, drooped down.

Right on top of her head.

Sophia frowned.

She didn't remember seeing banana trees when she entered.

She shone her light around.

No signposts.

Her heart sank.

She was completely off course.

And had been for half an hour.

Not daring to delay.

She turned back.

A rumble sounded in the sky.

Torrential rain poured down.
###Chapter 350

Sophia Sullivan hurried to find shelter from the rain.

Trees attract lightning.

She couldn't hide under one.

A flash of lightning split the night sky.

It illuminated the surroundings for an instant.

Sophia spotted a waist-high rock not far away.

The center of the rock was concave.

It formed a natural small cave.

Though the space was narrow.

It could barely fit one person.

The rain grew heavier.

Bean-sized raindrops pelted her body.

Bringing a slight stinging sensation.

She quickened her pace.

Groping her way toward the rock.

Just as she was about to reach it.

Her foot suddenly slipped.

Sophia lost her balance.

She tumbled forward.

This was恰好 a slope.

Once she fell, she couldn't stop herself from rolling.

She instinctively protected her head and face.

The slope was covered with some type of plant.

The grass-like texture provided some cushioning.

The rain-soaked earth was also soft.

After a dizzying tumble.

Sophia finally rolled to the bottom of the slope.

Her whole body ached.

Her vision went black.

It took her a good while to regain consciousness.

She was already completely drenched.

Everything was pitch black around her.

In her dazed state, she didn't know where she was.

She forced herself to calm down.

Clenched her teeth.

Used the nearby weeds and a tree trunk to push herself up.

As soon as she stood.

A sharp pain shot through her ankle.

She squatted down to check.

Using her phone's weak light.

She saw her ankle was swollen like a steamed bun.

Fortunately, it wasn't bleeding.

She tried to move it.

It hurt but she could still move it.

It probably wasn't broken.

Just a sprain.

Sophia breathed a slight sigh of relief.

She checked the seeds in her backpack.

The backpack was covered in wet mud.

The items inside were all damaged.

But the seeds were intact.

Dragging her injured foot.

She moved to shelter between two nearby rocks.

This rainstorm came suddenly.

It left just as quickly.

After about twenty minutes, the rain stopped.

Sophia leaned against the rock.

Soaked to the bone.

Her body felt alternately hot and cold.

The wet clothes were heavy and cold.

Taking them off would make her cold.

Not taking them off made her even colder.

Her phone was completely dead.

It had shut off automatically.

…

Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence were frantic with worry.

They waited and waited at the agreed meeting spot.

The sky gradually darkened.

Until it was completely black.

Still, Sophia hadn't arrived.

A rainstorm was imminent.

They kept calling Sophia's phone.

It remained unreachable.

A sense of foreboding settled over them.

"We can't just wait here." Marcus decided firmly. "Something must have happened. We have to find the lead instructor."

Hannah nodded hurriedly. "Finding the lead instructor will let us contact the garden administration. They can locate Sophia's position through surveillance or technical means. Then we can mount a rescue... What's the lead instructor's number?"

Marcus froze.

"Wasn't it in the group chat?"

Hannah sighed helplessly. "Our first-year grad students don't have a group."

Too few first-year grad students had chosen this course.

Only the three of them, Shane Holloway, Ashley Lowell, and a few others.

They had long since become enemies.

They didn't get along.

No group had been created.

The lead instructor hadn't been invited to join any group either.

Marcus was panicking internally.

But he forced himself to stay calm. "The school sent three lead instructors. It's just gotten dark. Many groups haven't found their basic specimens yet. Let's go to the nearest major zone first. See if we can run into them. Or maybe we'll find some senior students. Ask them for help contacting the instructors. Whatever happens, let's just go."

"Okay!"

The two set off immediately.

Sprinting toward the nearest Zone A.

They ran into Shane Holloway and his group on the way.

Shane saw their hurried, anxious expressions.

He guessed they were in a bind.

Old and new grudges surged in his heart.

He deliberately blocked their path. "In such a hurry. Where are you off to? Tell me about it?"

Hannah saw his cocky, troublemaking demeanor.

She knew he was up to no good.

Normally, she would have traded barbs.

But right now, her mind was filled with worry for Sophia's safety.

She had no time to waste.

Suddenly, she remembered Shane was smooth-talking and good at哄 people.

On the way here, he had been chatting with the lead instructor the whole time.

He might have the contact information.

"Shane, do you know the lead instructor's phone number? WeChat is fine too! We need to find him urgently. It's an emergency."

Shane raised an eyebrow.

His eyes shifted.

An emergency, huh...

"Well, well. You know what? I actually do have it!"

Hannah's eyes lit up. "Could you send it to me?"

"Sure. Wait a moment, let me find it..." He took out his phone. Pretended to search.

Hannah thought he had turned over a new leaf.

She waited and waited.

Her patience wore thin.

Shane still hadn't found it.

"Really sorry. Seems like I don't have it either." He smirked, his eyes full of mockery.

"You did that on purpose—! If you don't have it, you don't have it. Is messing with us fun?!"

Shane shrugged. "Pretty fun. Don't you think?"

Hannah was furious. "Has anyone ever told you you're really despicable? Especially when you're acting like a petty villain."

"You bitch, say that again?!"

"I just said it—despicable, despicable, despicable! So damn despicable!"

Shane sneered. "Might as well be honest with you. I not only have the lead instructor's contact info, I even know where he is. But I'm just not telling you. What are you going to do about it?"

Marcus's tone dropped sharply. "Sophia Sullivan is missing. Only by finding the lead instructor can we contact the garden administration. Organize a search and rescue. I'm telling you this not for you to gloat, but to inform you the situation is critical. A life is at stake! You can choose not to provide the contact information. But you need to understand the consequences. If something really happens, your behavior right now is refusing to save a life in danger."

"Ha!" Shane scoffed. "Is that a threat? Don't try to scare me! What could possibly happen to a living person like Sophia Sullivan?"

"Stop wasting time. Let's go quickly." Amelia Roscente couldn't help but urge.

Shane was a guy, after all.

Why did he gossip more than a woman?

As for Sophia being missing...

What did it have to do with her?

Not just missing.

She didn't care if she lived or died.

Fiona Valentine did show some concern. "I feel like it's about to storm heavily. If someone gets lost in the garden, it could be very dangerous."

Hannah seemed to grasp at a lifeline.

She looked at her with hopeful eyes. "So do you know where the lead instructor is? Or just give me the contact information! Please!"

Fiona looked embarrassed. "Sorry. I just came back from Zone C. Didn't see any lead instructors along the way. Don't have their contact info either. Sorry, can't help you."

Jude Granger became genuinely worried. "How could she be missing? When? Where did she disappear? I... I'll go directly to the garden staff to report the situation!"
###Chapter 351

Shane Holloway was so angry he wanted to slap him. "Are you insane? The staff left hours ago. Who are you going to find?"

Jude Granger ran a hand through his hair. He hesitated for a few seconds before gritting his teeth. "We have to try. We can't just sit here and wait!"

He turned and ran off without waiting for a response.

With no leads from Shane Holloway, Marcus Lawrence and Hannah Morse had no choice but to keep searching.

Strangely, they crossed the entire Zone A without seeing a single person.

Hannah Morse's eyes welled up with frustrated tears. "What do we do? It's been almost two hours since Sister Clara disappeared. We're just running around like headless chickens! We're useless!"

Seeing her tears fall, Marcus Lawrence's own composure began to crack.

"Don't cry. We're trying to think of something…"

"What is there to think of?! Nothing! I'm so worried about her. It's so dark, and the rain is so heavy… what if something happened to her?!"

"Marcus Lawrence, you're so capable. Your family is so powerful. Can't you do something? Please…"

Family.

It suddenly clicked for Marcus Lawrence. How could he have forgotten?

Damn it!

"Okay."

Hannah Morse stared, confused. "...What?"

"I said okay. I'll ask my family for help."

"Are… are you sure? I was just talking. I didn't mean to pressure you…"

She had learned about his family's background at his birthday party. She'd also witnessed their low-key style firsthand.

Their massive compound didn't even have smart toilets, just regular ones, or even squat toilets.

She deeply respected their simple and unadorned style.

Her earlier outburst was born of pure panic for Sophia Sullivan's safety.

Marcus Lawrence pulled out his phone. "You reminded me. I forgot I could ask them for help…"

He was so used to not relying on his family's connections that it didn't even occur to him.

"Are you sure it won't cause trouble for them?"

Marcus Lawrence's voice was firm. "My grandfather always said power is wasted if it isn't used to help people."

The call connected quickly.

"Uncle, it's Owen. Can I speak to Grandpa?"

His grandfather was on a two-week state visit abroad. Given the time difference, it should be midday there.

"Owen. Is it urgent? The old leader is resting…"

"Yes. It's very urgent."

The voice on the other end immediately turned serious. "Understood. Please hold."

"Thank you, Uncle."

Soon, the elder's voice came through the line.

Marcus Lawrence explained the situation concisely and asked if his grandfather could do anything.

The old man listened intently. A student was missing, and neither the school chaperone nor the botanical garden staff were addressing it.

A life was at stake. Did these people understand the gravity of the situation?!

"Don't panic. I'll contact the garden's management immediately. I'll have them handle it ASAP."

"Thank you, Grandpa."

"Owen, you did the right thing. If no one is taking charge in a situation like this, you must contact the family first. This isn't about connections or favors. Remember—a human life is paramount!"

"Understood, Grandpa."

While Marcus Lawrence was on the phone, Hannah Morse wasn't idle.

Remembering Sophia Sullivan's good relationship with Professor Shaw, she found Alexander Laurent's number and called.

No one answered. Twice.

…

Alexander Laurent was attending an academic conference.

The sky was dark. It was nearly 7 PM, and the event was winding down.

The host announced his name. Under the gaze of the crowd, he took the stage to deliver the closing address.

His phone vibrated twice in his pocket. He couldn't answer.

An inexplicable sense of foreboding washed over him. His eyelid twitched violently.

He provided a concise summary of the conference's key topics. His points were incisive, his perspectives unique.

The audience listened, captivated, nodding along.

But those familiar with his presentations noticed something different…

He usually favored a meticulous, step-by-step approach. Today, he raced through the content.

He bowed in thanks and strode out of the venue, leaving his peers staring in surprise.

He immediately tried to call back.

The line was busy.

She wasn't blocking him. She was actually on another call.

…

Unable to reach Alexander Laurent, Hannah Morse tried someone else.

She recalled Professor Professor Benjamin Murphy from the Computer Science department attending the lab's opening ceremony. He seemed friendly with Sophia Sullivan.

Professor Shang had wide connections. Maybe he could help?

Professor Benjamin Murphy was currently leading a programming team in a competition abroad. He was anxiously waiting outside the venue when Hannah Morse called.

He was already stressed about the competition. Hearing Sophia Sullivan was missing made him frantic.

He knew Alexander Laurent's schedule was packed. It was normal he couldn't answer. If they needed someone else…

A name popped into his head. The more he thought about it, the more suitable it seemed. "...The competition is about to end here. I'm completely tied up. Here's what… I'll text you a number. Call it. Explain the situation. He will definitely find a way."

"Okay. Thank you, Professor Shang."

The text arrived moments after they hung up.

She dialed immediately.

"Hello, this is Hannah Morse. Professor Shang told me to contact you. He said you could help… It's about my friend, Sister Clara…"

Sebastian Evans was initially confused. Hearing "Clara" made him sit bolt upright.

He was in the middle of a business dinner.

They had been deadlocked for half an hour over a 0.5% concession.

Sebastian Evans knew the other side was just trying to drive the price down as far as possible.

He sat there smiling, eating, making small talk. Casually, he pointed out critical flaws in their product, catching them completely off guard.

Their faces fell. They were just considering conceding when Sebastian Evans's phone rang.

The next moment, they watched the calm, decisive man's expression change drastically. He stood up abruptly.

And then…

He left.

He just walked out on a deal worth hundreds of millions?!

His vice president was equally stunned.

His boss was always professional. He never dropped the ball. What was happening?

He had to awkwardly smooth things over. "My apologies, everyone. Mr. Brown has an urgent private matter to attend to. He had to leave. Please, allow me to host the rest of the evening…"

He'd just made up an excuse. He didn't realize he'd accidentally guessed the truth.

…

Back at the base hotel, Fiona Valentine had just finished her shower. Her skin was flushed pink from the steam.

Her group had already collected the ten required basic plant specimens. They could turn in their work and get their final grades.

She was in a good mood.

Tomorrow was Friday. If they left at 5 PM, they'd be back at school by 6.

Should she… ask Ethan Roscente out to dinner?
The moonlight was cold and bleak.
A bitter wind howled outside.

But inside the bar, it was as warm as spring.

Charlie Lowell had organized a drinking game.
###Chapter 352

The card table was bustling with noise and excitement.

"Royal flush! I win again! That sports car is mine now!"

"No way! That last hand doesn't count! Let's go again!"

"Tsk. Can't handle losing? Fine. One more chance. If I win again, that villa under your name is mine too."

"Deal!"

A villa and a car were nothing to them.
They could afford the loss.

Ethan Roscente wasn't playing.
He watched the commotion from the sidelines.

As one round ended, he glanced back and saw Ethan drinking alone on the sofa.

"Hey, man. Just drinking? The stakes are pretty high over there with the others. Not joining?"

Ethan wasn't interested. "You guys play."

He poured another glass of wine.

A bottle of Château Lafite was being gulped down like water.
In no time, only a third remained.

Charlie winced at the sight, deciding to leave him be.
He turned back to watch the cards.

Ethan's expression was blank as he continued pouring.

His phone suddenly rang.

It was Fiona Valentine.

He didn't want to answer.
But remembering her past help, he picked up.

"Hello."

His breathing was slightly heavy, his voice cold.
The background music was deafening.

The woman paused, guessing he was at a bar.
She didn't ask, just mentioned dinner plans for the next day.

Ethan's tone was lazy. "Got a client tomorrow night. Busy."

Fiona knew she should hang up.

That would be the thing to do.
It was what he wanted from a business partner.

But she couldn't help wanting to say more.

Before she could speak, Ethan asked first: "You said you had an exam today?"

"Yes. The format was quite unique."

"How so?" he asked offhandedly.

Fiona explained the plant conservatory's exam rules.

"...And we have to stay at the conservatory tonight. Interesting, right?"

"Mhm. Found all the specimens?"

Her eyes dimmed, voice calm. "All ten basic specimens are collected."

Ethan had lost interest by then.

Fiona said goodbye first.

Her abruptness made him raise an eyebrow.

He put his phone away and kept pouring.

The glass was almost full.

His phone rang again.

It was Victoria Roscente.
She said Amelia Roscente wasn't answering her phone and was worried something happened.

Ethan gave a few replies, but Victoria kept nagging.

He hung up in annoyance.

She was still his sister.
He found Amelia's number and dialed.

The first call didn't connect.

He tried a second time.

This time, it went through.

Before he could speak, Amelia shrieked: "Bro? Why are you calling? Don't tell me you heard about Sophia Sullivan going missing too?"

Sophia Sullivan, somehow, had connections that mobilized the entire plant conservatory within half an hour.

Emergency广播 notifications went out.
All staff were deployed for search and rescue.
Even local police were called in.

She'd also heard the conservatory's top two leaders were on-site directing operations.

On her way back to her quarters, she overheard two staff members whispering.
They said someone from above was applying pressure—big pressure—with an ultimatum:

If she isn't found, everyone is fired!

What kind of clout did that take?
What kind of background?
What kind of powerful backing?

Amelia was fuming.
She wanted to rush out and tell them: She has no clout or background! She's just a used-up二手货 my brother tossed aside!

Now that Ethan was calling, she instinctively thought it was about Sophia.

"You said Sophia Sullivan is missing?! How? Where are you?" The man shot upright, nearly crushing his glass.

Amelia was confused. "...You're not calling about her?"

Ethan's eyes were red. He spoke slowly, deliberately. "Answer me first! Why is Sophia missing?! Where?! Where are you right now?"

Amelia was frightened. "I-I just heard the broadcast. They said Sophia Sullivan went missing in the Amazon Rainforest Exhibit. The whole conservatory is..."

He hung up before she finished.

Charlie was engrossed in the card game.
###Chapter 353

The stakes had doubled this round—two cars, two apartments.

Suddenly, a gust of wind rushed past him.

He turned around, stunned. "Was that Ethan? Why's he running so fast? What happened?"

...

In the pitch-black, lightless woods—

Sophia Sullivan had injured her foot.
She could only wait for rescue where she was.

The rain had stopped.
The night was silent, making her hearing acutely sharp.

Residual raindrops slid off leaves.
They dripped into puddles on the ground with a soft plink.

Nocturnal birds and chirping insects occasionally called out...

Every tiny sound was amplified by the stillness.

Fortunately, Sophia had a steady mindset and a clear head—

The conservatory had no large predators.
No need to worry about being attacked.

The grounds were regularly treated for pests.
Even if there were snakes, they weren't venomous.

Most importantly, she was only lost in a man-made botanical garden.
It wasn't the actual wilderness.

As long as she held out long enough, rescue would surely come.

The only discomfort was her wet clothes clinging to her skin.
It was very unpleasant.

Thankfully, this was a climate-controlled zone, simulating a tropical environment.
The temperature was relatively high.

In her panic earlier, she had hidden between two rocks.
The space was narrow, forcing her to curl up.

Now that the rain had stopped and she had regained some strength, she planned to move to a spot where she could at least stretch out.

She began to shift slowly.

Suddenly, the sound of hurried footsteps reached her.

Sophia froze—

Yes!

Footsteps!

Rescue?!

She held her breath, pricking up her ears, trying to pinpoint the direction.

Northeast. Not too far away!

She was about to call out when she abruptly heard—

"Sophia Sullivan! Sophia Sullivan! Can you hear me? If you hear me, answer me!"

That voice...
Sebastian's voice cut through the rainforest.

"I'm here!" Sophia called back immediately.

The tropical plant base was densely vegetated.

Visibility was severely limited.

Anyone unfamiliar with the terrain could easily get lost.

Sebastian had asked Hannah Morse before entering.

He only knew the general direction.

The deeper he went, the darker it became.

Until all light was completely lost.

Darkness enveloped everything.

He gripped his flashlight.

The beam was narrow.

He could only call her name as he walked.

Half an hour later.

He splashed through puddles.

He was about to change direction.

Suddenly, he heard her response.

"Don't move, I'm coming—"

"Okay!"

Her voice sounded like she was holding up.

Sebastian's anxious heart settled slightly.

He followed the sound.

Finally, he found Sophia between two large rocks.

The flashlight beam swept over her face.

She was covered in mud.

Her hair was disheveled.

Her backpack was torn.

He hurried forward and helped her up.

"Are you hurt?"

The worst-case scenarios flashed through his mind.

Seeing her conscious now.

With no obvious blood.

He finally felt truly relieved.

Sophia shook her head. "Sprained my ankle. Are you alone?"

"The base is organizing a search party. They'll be here soon."

Sebastian took off his windbreaker and draped it over her.

"Which foot? Let me stabilize it first."

"Thank you."

She rolled up her right pant leg.

Her ankle was swollen, red, and badly bruised.

It looked painful.

Sebastian frowned as he examined it.

Sophia sucked in a sharp breath.

Clearly in significant pain.

He stopped immediately.

"Does it hurt here?"

"Not too much."

"Probably not broken, but it still needs support."

He found a sturdy branch.

He used vines to wrap and secure it.

"Alright. I'll carry you out."

Sophia didn't argue.

She leaned onto his back.

Her hands rested on his shoulders.

Sebastian supported her under her knees.

He stood up steadily.

"The ground is uneven. Hold on tight."

She hesitated for two seconds.

Then she crossed her arms over his chest.

A slight smile touched Sebastian's lips.

He began carrying her back.

"Do you know the way?" Sophia broke the silence.

"Not sure, but I saw a climate-controlled rest area on my way in. I'll take you there first."

"Okay."

Quiet settled between them again.

"Were you scared? Alone and injured in the dark."

"It was alright. I knew Hannah would send help. No dangerous animals here, just very dark."

"You're quite resilient."

"What else could I do? Cry?"

"It wouldn't hurt to try. Crying can release emotions."

"I didn't have any emotions to release."

"So I didn't even get a chance to offer a shoulder?"

Sophia had no retort.

Sebastian headed west.

In less than five minutes.

A rustling sound approached.

Both tensed, alert.

A beam from another flashlight swept past.

Alexander Laurent appeared.

He had followed the sound of their voices.

Seeing Sebastian carrying Sophia.

He paused for a moment.

Then his brow furrowed.

"Injured? How bad? Size of the wound? What's her temperature?"

Sophia quickly explained it was just her ankle.

Alexander shone his light on her feet.

Noting the branch splint on her right ankle.

He immediately shrugged off his backpack.

He gestured for Sebastian to put her down.

"I brought a professional splint and bandages. It needs proper care."

Sophia was surprised. "Professor, can you see the future?"

Sebastian was also taken aback.

Alexander kept his head down, retrieving items.

"Not exactly. I prepared for other scenarios too."

That's why he had set out later than Sebastian.

He was still gathering supplies when Sebastian left.

Besides the splint and bandages.

He had even brought adrenaline.

But that wasn't necessary to mention.

"Here."

Sebastian carefully set Sophia down.

Letting Alexander tend to the injury.

The latter was clearly more skilled.

"Professor, it's really not that serious. Just a swollen ankle. Thank you, Professor~"

Sophia even managed a lighthearted tone.

Alexander's brow remained furrowed.

But he visibly relaxed.

"All done."
###Chapter 354

Sophia Sullivan was surprised. "So soon?"

Alexander Laurent gave a quiet hum of affirmation.
He retrieved an insulated water bottle from his backpack. "You got drenched. Drink some warm water first."
He unscrewed the cap.

The warm water spread a comforting heat down her throat.

Sophia's eyes brightened slightly. "Professor, you brought hot water?"

Alexander didn't answer.
He lifted his gaze to meet Sebastian Evans's scrutinizing look.

Sebastian raised an eyebrow. "Professor Laurent is very well-prepared."

Alexander's tone was calm. "I prefer to be prepared before setting out."
"If Sophia's injuries were severe and we had no medicine on hand, the consequences could have been dire."

Sebastian fell silent.
He felt targeted.

Sophia cleared her throat softly. "Professor, do you know the way back?"

Alexander replied, "It's dark and the rain is heavy. I noted the general direction when we came in, but to retrace our exact steps, we'll need to navigate as we go."

Sebastian asked, "How confident are you?"

"Eighty percent."

Sophia breathed a sigh of relief. "Then let's follow your direction for now. We might run into someone from the base."

"Alright." Both men nodded in unison.

However...

Alexander looked at her. "Do you need to rest?"

Sophia shook her head. "It's better to get out as soon as possible."

Sebastian hoisted her onto his back.
Alexander used a flashlight to light the way.

The three of them moved forward together, but the atmosphere was strangely tense.

Silence stretched between them, each man lost in his own thoughts.

Sophia's head felt heavy, and she was nearly asleep when Alexander suddenly spoke.

"Mr. Evans, would you like me to take a turn carrying her?"

Sebastian shifted away. "No need. She's light."

Alexander glanced at the drowsy Sophia and didn't insist.

They walked for what felt like an eternity.
Then, a faint glimmer of light appeared in the darkness.

Sophia jolted awake. "There's light ahead! Let's go that way!"

Sebastian immediately changed direction.

About ten minutes later, they indeed found the exit of the tropical climate-controlled zone.

Alexander confirmed the sign. "This is the exit."

Sophia let out a long breath. "Finally, we can get out!"

A slight smile touched Sebastian's lips.

The exit was a reinforced glass door with a fingerprint lock.
The door had been open when Alexander entered, but now it was shut tight.

He moved closer to inspect it and found an emergency intercom unit next to the lock.
It was likely for contacting the outside in case of an emergency.

He was hesitating whether to press it when Sebastian, having freed a hand, reached out and pressed the button directly.

"Wait—" Alexander's warning came too late.

Sebastian frowned. "Why hesitate? A yellow bell is the universal symbol for emergency contact."
He pressed it a few more times.

Alexander's expression darkened.

Two minutes passed.
There was no response from the other end.

Sebastian was about to press it again when the alarm suddenly emitted a piercing screech.

"What's happening?" He was stunned.

Sophia's heart sank.
Seeing Alexander's grave expression, she immediately understood.

Alexander said, "You were too impulsive."

Sebastian was confused. "The symbol clearly indicated that."

Alexander explained, "A yellow bell can have two meanings. One is emergency contact. The other is a warning."

"Warning?"

"This buzzing is the warning alert. While this botanical garden doesn't have many large predators, snakes, insects, rats, and ants are inevitable. Some could be venomous."
"This button was probably for warning and seeking shelter."

Sophia spoke up suddenly. "Did I just hear the lock engage?"

Alexander nodded. "I heard it too."
He stepped forward to check the glass door.

The only door leading out of this climate-controlled zone was now completely locked.

Sebastian frowned. "What do you mean, locked?"

Alexander clarified, "This door could originally be opened with a code. Now, because the warning was triggered, it's been forcibly locked down."

Sophia asked, "The code won't work either?"

"No."

Sebastian pressed his lips together. "My apologies. I was too hasty."

Hope dashed, Sophia couldn't help but feel disappointed.

Fortunately, the exit area had electricity and lights.
Their phones also had signal again.

Alexander took out his phone. "I'll contact the garden administration. A technical issue like this should have dedicated personnel to resolve it."

Sebastian frowned. "Why didn't you call earlier?"

Alexander replied evenly, "I was about to when you pressed the button."

Sebastian had no retort.

The call connected quickly.

"Hello, this is Alexander Laurent. Sebastian Evans and I have found Sophia Sullivan. We are currently at the exit of the tropical climate-controlled zone."
###Chapter 355

"We accidentally activated the warning device, and the door is now locked. Can you assist us in opening it?"

The garden staff member was silent for a few seconds before responding. "We did receive the warning alert, but only our technicians can handle the early warning system program."
"We've urgently recalled an engineer. You'll need to wait patiently for rescue..."

Alexander asked, "How long will it take?"

"Pardon?"

"How long until the door can be opened?"

"Out of our three technicians, two are on a training course in魔都. The last one lives in燕郊. It will take him approximately... five hours to get here."

Alexander was silent.
Five hours would see the break of dawn.

"Is there no other way?"

"Sorry, none of us are technically trained."

They could only wait.
Alexander Laurent ended the call.

He looked at the other two. "The rescue team is on their way."

Thunder rumbled loudly.

A gust of wind carried damp air straight at them.

Sophia Sullivan frowned. "It's going to rain again."

Sebastian Evans scanned their surroundings. "There's a pavilion up ahead."

He pointed not far away.

It was a classical square pavilion with four corners.

Sophia nodded. "Let's go take shelter."

Sebastian hoisted her onto his back.

The three of them hurried toward the pavilion.

Sophia gently patted his shoulder. "You can put me down now."

Sebastian carefully set her down.

Alexander stood guard nearby.

Sophia hopped on one foot to a bench and sat down.

Alexander opened his backpack.

He pulled out a thermos. "Have some hot water."

Sophia accepted the cup.

She took small sips of the warm liquid.

Alexander then produced a set of athletic wear from his bag.

It was for women.

Both top and pants were included.

Sophia's eyes widened in surprise.

"Bought it last minute," Alexander said calmly. "Change into it."

Sebastian pressed his lips together.

He had been so worried about her safety.

He hadn't thought to bring a change of clothes.

"You're completely soaked," Sebastian said. "Alexander and I will wait over there."

Sophia nodded. "Okay."

Alexander handed her a dry towel. "Dry your hair."

"...Thank you."

Sophia's voice caught slightly.

She always knew Alexander was attentive.

But she hadn't expected this level of consideration.

The wet clothes were cold and uncomfortable against her skin.

The two men turned and walked a short distance away.

Sophia quickly changed out of her wet clothes.

She accidentally bumped her injured foot while pulling on the pants.

She sucked in a sharp breath from the pain.

Alexander clenched his fist.

He fought the urge to turn around.

Sebastian was equally unsettled.

Three minutes later.

Sophia called out softly, "I'm done."

The two men returned to the pavilion.

Sophia was drying her hair with the towel, her locks loose.

Her cheeks were flushed, but her lips were pale.

Alexander poured another cup of hot water.

"It's too cold here," he said, frowning. "Is there somewhere else we can go to get out of the wind?"

Sebastian thought for a moment. "There's a climate-controlled lounge, but it's a two-hour walk. And there's no signal."

Sophia sneezed.

She was shivering all over.

She quickly took two more sips of hot water.

Sebastian started to take off his jacket to give to her.

Alexander stopped him. "Your jacket is wet too."

He unzipped his own windbreaker and draped it over Sophia's shoulders.

Sebastian's movements halted.

Sophia's teeth were chattering from the cold.

Even with dry clothes and hot water.

The chill seemed to seep deep into her bones.

The rain started again in the middle of the night.

A fine, continuous drizzle with a howling cold wind.

The pavilion was open on all sides.

Sophia's voice trembled. "So cold…"

She pulled the jacket tighter and hugged her arms.

Her eyelids grew heavy.

But the cold kept her from sleep.

Sebastian took off his wool sweater and placed it over her.

Alexander took out a thermometer.

"She might have a fever."

...

Elsewhere.

Ethan Roscente pushed his speed to 120 mph.

His sports car screeched to a halt at the botanical base entrance.

Amelia Roscente was waiting there.

Ethan shoved the car door open.

His face was icy as he walked up to his sister.

"Where is Sophia Sullivan?"

Amelia didn't dare hide anything.

She explained the situation in detail.

Ethan strode toward the control room.

He grabbed the manager by the collar.

"What are you doing!" The manager panicked. "We're doing everything we can to rescue them…"

"Everything?" Ethan sneereded. "They've been trapped for so long. Is this your 'everything'?"

The manager tried to struggle free. "The warning system isn't easy to bypass…"

"I don't care," Ethan said, word by word. "Get her out safely. Now."

The manager thought this man was unreasonable.

"Security! Call security!"

"One hour," Ethan's gaze was frigid. "I want to see Sophia Sullivan safe and sound."

He turned and left.

The manager stood frozen in place.

Just who was this guy?
###Chapter 356

Always a Step Behind

The commotion grew louder.

More students and staff gathered to watch.

"Who is that guy? He's so arrogant."

"He was with Fiona Valentine at the mixer. Is he her boyfriend?"

"No, he's a businessman. I've seen him in finance magazines!"

"Does money give him the right to act like this? He's threatening the botanical garden..."

The murmurs intensified.

The director's eye twitched. He took a deep breath.

He had intended to ignore Ethan Roscente.

But with so many people watching, he had to respond.

This botanical garden wasn't built on capitalist donations...

Before he could speak, Marcus Lawrence and Hannah Morse pushed through the crowd.

They looked frantic.

"Director, we're in Sophia Sullivan's group. Have you found her? What's happening?"

Seeing Hannah's genuine concern, the director answered directly.

"We've located Miss Sullivan. All three are safe and unharmed."

Hannah let out a long sigh of relief.

"Thank goodness they're found..."

Marcus pressed further. "If they're found, why aren't they out yet?"

Director: "The emergency lock was triggered accidentally. Exits are sealed. Technicians are on their way."

Marcus frowned. "How long will that take?"

"Perhaps... a few hours."

"Can you at least send supplies in?"

"That... isn't possible right now."

Ethan froze at the word "three."

It took him a moment to process.

"...Three? Why three? Wasn't it just Sophia?"

The director's expression turned cold toward Ethan.

"Professor Laurent and Mr. Evans arrived two hours ago. They entered the climate zone before we could stop them. They're with Miss Sullivan now."

Alexander Laurent and Sebastian Evans.

Again.

Why was he always a step behind?

Why?!

Ethan stared blankly, his eyes burning red.

Fiona Valentine hurried over.

Seeing Ethan like this, she felt she was seeing a stranger.

The aloof, composed man she knew vanished whenever Sophia Sullivan was involved.

Her heart ached, but she forced a smile.

She gently took his arm, speaking softly to comfort him.

"The director said Sophia is fine. Technicians will be here soon. Let's just wait a little longer. The door will open..."

Ethan remained silent.

The thought of two other men with her now felt like a stone lodged in his chest.

He couldn't swallow it or cough it up.

Hearing Fiona's words, the director's expression softened slightly.

"I know you're worried. I assure you, we are doing everything we can to rescue them. No one is slacking off. It's the middle of the night. Everyone wants this resolved quickly so we can all go rest."

He looked at Ethan.

"No matter how much you protest or threaten tonight, the wait time remains the same. It's better to wait quietly. This happened in our garden. You're anxious, but we are even more so."

"Let's try to understand each other."

Ethan's face was still rigid, but he stopped causing a scene.

He seemed to have listened.

Fiona quietly sighed in relief.

But...

The pointed stares and whispers around them were humiliating.

Her boyfriend was publicly losing his mind over another woman.

A woman who was their classmate in the same college and major.

The implications were enough to fuel endless gossip.

The world never lacked for spectators.

The crowd's size depended only on how juicy the drama was.

Ashley Lowell watched the arguing over Sophia Sullivan and sneered.

"Absolutely ridiculous!"

She thought something serious had happened.

But this?

Sophia was still alive, wasn't she?

They found her. Was all this fuss necessary?

"Exactly," Shane Holloway immediately agreed. "She got herself lost, and now everyone has to search for her in the middle of the night? Is Sophia Sullivan some kind of royalty? Do we all owe her something?"

Hannah glared at him.

"Watch your mouth! We're from the same college. If you won't help, fine, but there's no need to spread rumors."

Marcus said coldly,

"If you don't want to help, leave. No one is begging you. Since you have so many complaints, go back to sleep. We don't need your help, but don't you dare hold us back."

Shane snorted.

"Fine, I'm leaving! Who wants to stand around in the cold anyway?"

He turned and walked away.

Ashley rolled her eyes and followed.

"I'm tired. Going to bed."

Others gradually dispersed.

The director was handling it.

With the show over, there was no point staying.

Finally, only Ethan, Fiona, garden staff, Marcus, Hannah, and three lead teachers remained.

At some point, rain began to fall again.

A steady, lonely drizzle.

The night wind, heavy with moisture, seeped through the window cracks.

Frost formed on the wooden window frames.

Hannah tightened her coat and walked to the window.

She looked out through the glass, worried.

The nearby lights provided some brightness.

But further out, it was pitch black, tree branches swaying in the wind and rain.

Please be safe, Sophia...

By 2 a.m., the rain eased, but the temperature plummeted.

Alexander Laurent focused.

"The temperature control system must be adjusting."

This was supposed to be a tropical zone. It shouldn't be this cold.

But their area simulated a tropical desert climate.

A key feature of tropical deserts is the extreme temperature difference between day and night.

Alexander used the coat Sebastian handed him to wrap around Sophia.

His own jacket was already around her.

Even that wasn't enough.

Her body temperature was rising, yet her hands and feet were ice cold. She shivered violently.

The wind made it worse.

Sophia had only meant to rest her eyes for a moment.

But once closed, she fell into endless nightmares.

Her mind told her to wake up.

Reality was her eyelids were too heavy to open.

Cold...

So cold...

She instinctively curled up, wishing she could wrap herself into a cocoon.

It seemed the only way to feel slightly better.
###Chapter 357

She leaned against the cold stone pillar.

Her cheeks were flushed with an unnatural redness.

Her body trembled uncontrollably.

She held herself tightly with both arms.

"Sophia?" Alexander Laurent called her name softly.

Sophia Sullivan's eyes were tightly shut.

Her eyelashes fluttered restlessly.

She was in a semi-conscious state.

Alexander reached out and touched her forehead.

The temperature was alarmingly high.

"This is bad, her fever is getting worse." Alexander's voice was grave. "If this continues, something will happen long before the doors open."

Sebastian Evans ran a hand through his hair in frustration. "You think I don't know that? But there's nothing here!"

No medicine.

No way to get warm.

Not even a place to shelter from the wind.

Alexander suddenly extended his hand.

His palm was flat, forming a ninety-degree angle with his body.

Sebastian frowned. "What are you doing?"

A few seconds later, Alexander withdrew his hand. "The wind is from the northwest now. Move her to the other side of that pillar. At least it will block the wind."

"Okay." Sebastian agreed immediately.

They carefully moved Sophia to the sheltered spot.

Sebastian pulled out his lighter. "I'll go find some dry wood to start a fire."

"No." Alexander pointed north and south. "There are smoke detectors over there. Trigger the alarm and the entire park will be drenched."

Sebastian winced at the word 'alarm'.

"Then what do you suggest? What can I do?"

Alexander raised an eyebrow. "You're willing to follow my lead, Mr. Evans?"

Sebastian gave a cold laugh. "I might not like you, but I'm not an idiot who can't tell what's important."

Alexander looked at him for a moment. "There's fever reducer in my bag. Find it and mix it with warm water for her."

Sebastian's eyes widened. "You had medicine all along and didn't say anything?!"

"You didn't ask."

Gritting his teeth, Sebastian rummaged through the backpack.

"Is this it?"

"Yes. Use the dosage on the instructions."

Sebastian carefully administered the medicine to Sophia.

Alexander then took out gauze and rubbing alcohol from his bag.

He tore the gauze into small pieces.

Sebastian frowned. "What's that for now?"

"Use the alcohol to wipe her palms, forehead, and behind her ears. It's a physical cooling method." Alexander continued his task without pause.

After giving the medicine, Sebastian came over to help.

One tore the gauze, the other moistened it with alcohol and wiped.

The wind and rain had stopped at some point.

An immense silence filled the world.

Two men who were like fire and water worked together with seamless coordination.

Half an hour later, Alexander checked her temperature again.

"How is it?" Sebastian asked urgently.

"It's come down…"

Sebastian started to breathe a sigh of relief.

"But not by much. She's still feverish."

Sebastian's relief caught in his throat.

"How much alcohol is left?"

"Not much."

"Keep going. We can only take this one step at a time."

Fortunately, by the time the alcohol was used up, Sophia's temperature had dropped to 38 degrees Celsius.

Four hours had already passed of the promised five.

Another hour went by, and the main gate remained firmly shut.

Even the phone signal had disappeared.

There was no way to contact the person in charge, let alone call for medical help.

Sebastian was so angry he wanted to kick the door.

Alexander spoke calmly. "If you don't want to trigger another protocol, put your foot away."

Sebastian silently withdrew his foot.

He couldn't afford to make the same mistake twice.

Alexander helped Sophia sit up and looked at Sebastian. "Come here."

"What for?"

"Sit behind her."

"Why?"

"We'll surround her front and back. The pillar blocks the wind from the side, creating a sheltered area to help keep her warm."

"Okay."

Body heat did transfer.

Although the three weren't in direct contact, warmth gathered in the small space.

Whether the method was effective or it was a psychological effect, it seemed to work.

As the sky began to lighten, Sophia's fever finally broke, and her breathing steadied.

Alexander and Sebastian both sighed in relief simultaneously.

Fatigue washed over them, and they closed their eyes for a brief rest.

Sunlight broke through the clouds, spilling onto the earth.

The snow on the mountain peaks was gilded with a golden light.

It was another rare clear winter day.

Morning dew still clung to the air, and the wind rustled softly.

The main gate was urgently opened, the sound of footsteps startling birds from the trees.

Ethan Roscente was the first to rush in.

He had waited all night, his steps hurried, desperate to see the person he was worried about.

The temperature-controlled area had no surveillance, and he had spent the whole night anxious about Sophia's condition.

He didn't even dare to imagine what Alexander and Sebastian might have done.

He knew he shouldn't think that way, but he couldn't help it.

Dark circles shadowed Ethan's eyes, stubble dotted his chin, and he looked utterly haggard.

The next second, he stopped dead in his tracks, completely frozen in place.
###Chapter 358

The dilapidated pavilion was open to the wind on all sides.

Alexander Laurent and Sebastian Evans sat on the ground.

Sophia Sullivan was sheltered between them.

Sebastian had his eyes closed, resting, his head slightly bowed.

From Ethan Roscente's perspective, it looked as though he was leaning against Sophia's shoulder.

Alexander was also resting with his eyes closed.

His posture, however, was more restrained than Sebastian's.

He propped his head up with one arm, but his shoulder and back remained pressed against Sophia.

It wasn't a deliberate overstep.

He was simply providing support for Sophia, who was running a fever.

Even in sleep, he didn't dare relax his hold.

He maintained this position throughout the night.

Late into the night, Sebastian, unable to bear watching, suggested they switch places.

Alexander refused quietly. "No need. She's light."

Sebastian was left speechless.

This guy definitely held a grudge.

All three were fully dressed, with no hint of impropriety.

Yet an indescribable intimacy hung in the air.

Though Sophia's high fever had subsided, her cheeks remained flushed.

Her sleeping expression, however, was unusually peaceful...

One could only say that jealousy warps perception.

A deafening roar exploded in Ethan's mind.

It felt like a sledgehammer blow, leaving him rooted to the spot in shock.

The staff arriving behind him and the early-rising students also froze.

Was this a major showdown?

Two men... no, judging by Mr. Roscente's reaction, it was three men?

Hannah Morse was the first to charge into the garden.

She had set out around the same time as Ethan but fell behind due to her physique.

Even Marcus Lawrence had overtaken her.

Now, Hannah was struggling to push through the crowd.

The next second, her eyes widened.

What... what was this situation?

Still, their striking looks made the scene oddly pleasing to the eye?

She shook her head vigorously, dismissing the thought.

Her all-night worry fueled her sprint towards Sophia.

Someone was faster.

Ethan, eyes bloodshot, rushed forward.

He yanked the unconscious Sophia from between the two men and clamped her tightly against his chest. "Sophia! Wake up! Say something!"

Sebastian and Alexander had been light sleepers.

They had woken the moment Ethan approached.

Yet they still couldn't intervene in time.

Ethan's movements were rough, his possessiveness undisguised.

Sebastian immediately stood up to reclaim Sophia. "Are you insane? Can't you see how weak she is? She got caught in the rain and injured last night. We barely managed to get her fever down. Take your madness elsewhere!"

Ethan glared darkly. "What exactly happened last night? Why were the three of you staying together overnight?"

It was clearly just sitting together, yet he called it "staying together overnight."

Sebastian laughed in anger. "Ethan Roscente, who are you performing for? Didn't you already find someone new, claiming you've moved on? This act of yours... doesn't look like moving on."

Ethan gritted his teeth. "Give her back to me."

"The mask slips? I wondered how long you could keep it up. So your 'moving on' was just a tactic to win her back. Did you ever consider your new girlfriend's feelings?"

Sebastian sneered, looking past him.

Ethan stiffened and turned his head.

Fiona Valentine offered him a smile uglier than tears.

Alexander ignored their childish argument.

His first action upon waking was to call an ambulance.

The garden administration, prepared, had already called 911.

The garden director witnessed the tug-of-war and clicked his tongue inwardly—young people these days sure knew how to play!

Snapping back to reality, he hurried over. "Why are you arguing when she's this weak? Get her to a hospital, now!"

Hannah and Marcus rushed to help.

The ambulance arrived quickly.

After a brief examination, the paramedics, with help from Alexander and Sebastian, lifted her onto a stretcher.

An accompanying nurse called out, "Family members, follow us!"

"I am!"

"I can!"

"Me!"

Three male voices answered simultaneously.

The nurse frowned. "Only two can come. The rest find your own way."

She pointed to Alexander and Sebastian.

These two had rushed forward first, their anxiety and exhaustion seeming genuine.

As for the lone one...

As the ambulance doors closed, the nurse glanced at Ethan.

He reeked of alcohol, his eyes fierce like a bloodthirsty beast.

Better not.

Failing to follow the ambulance infuriated Ethan.

He immediately jumped into his sports car, the engine roaring as he gave chase.

He never once looked back at Fiona.

Fiona stood frozen in place.

The north wind whipped past, chilling her to the heart.

Bystanders whispered among themselves—

"Her boyfriend ran off for another woman?"

"Is it time for the female lead's counterattack and face-slapping?"

"You've been watching too many short dramas."

"He's the CEO of a listed company. Fiona comes from an ordinary family. Would she dare let go?"

"Look at what she's wearing. You can tell how generous Mr. Roscente is. Only a fool would break up."

Ashley Lowell crossed her arms and sneered. "Hey, your man ran off. Aren't you going after him?"

Fiona snapped out of it and smiled faintly. "There's no chasing after a deal. I believe Ethan won't disappoint me."

She gently smoothed her hair, her tone soft. "Sophia suffered this time. It's heartbreaking to see... It reminds me I should visit the hospital. We're classmates from the same college, after all. No need to make enemies."

She turned her gaze directly to Ashley. "But you all, you knew the contact information for the lead teacher, yet you deliberately withheld it when Marcus asked for help. Standing by without helping, what exactly were you plotting?"

The onlookers erupted in chatter.

The romance drama had instantly turned into a morality play!

Ashley flustered, retorting, "Nonsense! I don't have the teacher's contact! Shane didn't give it! Don't slander me!"

Shane Holloway was stunned.

How did the fire land on him?

Fiona raised an eyebrow. "Didn't you join the group? All three lead teachers are in the main group. I hadn't joined the group back then, otherwise I would have told Marcus. A life was at stake. How could personal motives lead to such negligence?"

Ashley was seething.

"I never thought Ashley could be so malicious..."

"A genius girl? With a heart this black!"

"I heard Professor Lowell is her aunt. All these years she's openly targeted Professor Watson. She must be siding with her aunt, hence targeting Sophia!"

"I think it's jealousy! Sophia just published in a Nature sub-journal. Ashley is afraid of losing her 'genius' title..."

Having successfully shifted the focus, Fiona allowed a slight smile to touch her lips before gracefully turning to leave.
###Chapter 359

Amelia Roscente watched her brother's car speed away.

The tires splashed through a puddle.

Sending mud flying everywhere.

She stomped her foot in frustration.

His own sister meant less than some outsider.

Sophia Sullivan again.

She and that woman were clearly destined to clash.

…

The Emergency Department at Massachusetts General Hospital was brightly lit.

A doctor quickly asked for the patient's history.

Sebastian Evans recounted what had happened.

Alexander Laurent stood nearby, adding details.

The changes in her temperature.

When the sweating started.

The point when the fever broke.

The doctor couldn't help but glance at him a few extra times.

The examination finished.

Sophia was wheeled into a patient room.

She woke briefly.

Alexander immediately stepped closer.

"Sophia?"

She gave a slight nod.

"You're at the hospital. Rest now."

Before he finished speaking.

She was asleep again.

Sebastian stepped forward a moment too late.

"Why didn't you call for me?"

"Not my obligation."

Alexander turned to find the doctor.

"How is she?"

"Tests are done, reports will be out later. Fever is down now. Severe ankle sprain, no bone damage. Medication applied, needs rest. Minimal movement."

"Thank you."

"Who will handle the payment?"

"I will." Ethan Roscente strode over and took the paperwork.

Sebastian frowned.

"Not comforting your girlfriend?"

"None of your business."

"She doesn't want to see you."

"And she wants to see you?"

"Ethan Roscente, don't oppose me."

"Sebastian Evans, stop hovering around her."

…

Amid the arguing.

Alexander walked into the patient room.

He looked at her pale, sleeping face.

He leaned down and whispered.

"Sorry I was late."

"It won't happen again."

Sophia's eyelashes fluttered slightly.

…

The argument in the hallway grew heated.

The doctor looked exasperated.

"Take it outside if you must argue."

Ethan fell silent.

Sebastian said nothing.

Alexander used Sophia's phone to pay the bill.

"What are you doing?"

"If she needs money, I have it."

Alexander looked up.

"She isn't short on money. She doesn't need to owe favors."

"Even if you pay now, she'll repay you when she wakes."

"Step aside."

Sebastian moved first.

Ethan reluctantly shifted out of the way.

"How do you know her password?"

"She told me."

Both men's faces darkened simultaneously.

…

Sophia woke up.

The world outside the window was gray and white.

A cold wind rattled the bare branches.

The sharp smell of disinfectant stung her nose.

She rubbed her nose.

Her ankle was wrapped thickly like a dumpling.

She tried to move it gently.

Not too bad.

Painful, but bearable.

Olivia Lopez entered carrying a water pitcher.

"You're up! Lie back down!"

"The doctor said bed rest!"

"I was so scared when I got the call!"

It had been a while since they'd seen each other.

Both were busy.

But Olivia was always there when needed.

"How long was I out?"

"A full day and night. It's morning now."

Sophia pressed her lips together.

Olivia understood.

"Three men were camped out here. Alexander Laurent was okay. The other two were like fighting cocks. I sent them away."

"Your classmates Hannah and Marcus were here too. They waited a long time but I told them to go home."

"My phone? Did Mom and Dad call?"

"Worry about yourself first." Olivia glared. "You almost broke a bone in your ankle. Rest for at least a week. I answered your parents' call. Didn't tell them you're hospitalized."

Sophia hugged her.

"You're the best, Liv~"

"Hmm? New perfume?"

"Yeah, someone gave it to me. Like it? Does it smell like light mist and summer lotus?"

"I'd love anything you wear~"

"Such a sweet talker~ Let me give you a kiss~"

"No! Help!~"

Olivia playfully pretended to pounce.

Her movements were exaggerated but careful.

The door suddenly opened.

"Olivia, I bought the basin—"

Julian Winston froze in the doorway.

Olivia was leaning over Sophia.

Puckering her lips for a kiss.

Sophia was laughing and blocking her.

The scene.

Looked exactly like a couple flirting.
###Chapter 360

Julian Winston stood at the doorway holding a basin.

His eyes were wide open.

He looked like a complete fool.

Olivia Lopez and Sophia Sullivan both turned to look at him.

"Did it take that long to buy a basin?" Olivia took the basin from him and smiled at Sophia. "The water's ready. A wipe-down will make you feel better."

"Thanks, Vivi~ You're the best~"

"Then let me give you a kiss?"

"No way. I haven't washed my face yet. Can't dirty the goddess."

Olivia: "I don't mind."

"..."

Julian stood frozen in place: "?" Am I the third wheel here?

"This logo..." Olivia stared at the basin for a moment. "Don't tell me this is Hermès?"

"Of course!" Julian lifted his chin. "Good taste, right?"

Olivia: "..."

"What's that look for?"

"The look you give a sucker. They sell these for twenty bucks outside the hospital. You had to go to the boutique and get ripped off?"

"Ripped off? What are you talking about?"

"A fat sheep delivers itself to the door. You'd be a fool not to shear it."

Julian: "..."

"Let's just make do." Olivia shot the basin a disdainful glance.

All show and no substance. A plastic basin would have been better.

"Olivia Lopez! You told me to buy it! I go and buy it, and now you're picking it apart! This is the first time this young master has run an errand for someone, and you don't even appreciate—"

"Can you shut up? Young master?" Olivia smiled as she turned back to look at him.

Julian instantly fell silent.

Sophia blinked, looking from one to the other.

Hmm, this looks interesting!

Olivia: "Why are you still standing there?"

Julian: "...Or else what?"

"Get out!" So annoying.

The man noticed the towel in her hand and suddenly understood. "Oh! I'm going—"

He vanished in the blink of an eye.

Olivia: "Close the door—"

"Got it! Can't you be a little gentler?"

"Get lost—"

"..." He shouldn't have said anything.

The door closed. Olivia tested the water temperature. "Come on, little Clara~"

Sophia: "...Vivi, you've become bad."

"Huh? How am I bad?"

Sophia: "That rogue attitude is exactly like Julian Winston's."

"??"

...

When Olivia walked out of the hospital entrance, Julian's car was still parked by the roadside.

He stuck his head out and waved—

"Vivi! Over here!"

Olivia paused. "Why are you still here?"

"Waiting for you. Get in." He said it like it was the most natural thing in the world.

"Who asked you to wait? Don't you have money to make instead of being so idle?"

"I've been waiting almost an hour. Can you do me this favor, princess?"

Olivia couldn't help but laugh. "Fine. I'll reluctantly let you drive me."

Julian was about to get out and open the door for her.

But Olivia had already pulled the door open herself and gotten in.

Julian: "..." Another missed opportunity.

The moment Olivia sat down, she heard a click.

The doors locked.

She raised an eyebrow and looked at Julian. "What are you doing?"

"Hehe..." Julian leaned over and directly captured her lips.

His hand slipped under her sweater, skillfully undoing her bra clasp.

"Vivi... Vivi..."

He murmured her name between kisses.

His voice was gentle, but his actions were domineering, as if he wanted to devour her whole.

Olivia pushed him away forcefully, her cheeks flushed, her breathing unsteady. "What's wrong with you? It's broad daylight. Get off."

The man looked unsatisfied. "Just a little longer..."

He pressed close again. "You've been with Sophia Sullivan these past two days. I missed you so much!"

"Missed me?" Olivia raised an eyebrow. "You're missing a word, aren't you?"

"Hehe, I missed sleeping with you. So what?"

He wrapped his long arms around her, pulling her into his embrace like a koala.

Olivia was long used to this behavior of his. She said flatly, "Young Master Gu has known countless women. Why are you still like a horny dog, ready to go at any moment?"

Julian's face darkened. "Who are you calling a dog?"

"You."

"..."

"Don't humiliate yourself next time. Getting insulted once wasn't enough, you had to ask for it again?"

"..."

"Olivia Lopez! That mouth of yours needs to be taught a lesson, doesn't it?! Let's see how I deal with you!"

"Hey, you— Mph!"

Julian smirked and directly sealed her lips.

The kiss was exceptionally long.

Olivia was almost out of breath, her face turning red from lack of air.

Julian refused to let go no matter what. It wasn't until Olivia bit the corner of his mouth, drawing blood, that she managed to break free.

"Are you a dog?" Julian hissed in pain.

Olivia unusually didn't retort.

She gasped for air, her cheeks completely red, her eyes moist, her lips slightly swollen.

Her gaze fixed straight ahead.

The man in the driver's seat, however, looked utterly satisfied, like a cat that got the cream.

Olivia didn't know how the two of them had ended up like this.

After that night of drunken passion, Olivia had decisively ended her collaboration with Julian.

She just hadn't found the time to tell her family yet.

As for Julian...

He had stormed out, slamming the door, and hadn't appeared for the next month.

Until—

Olivia accompanied her mother, Nina White, to a dinner engagement. Pushing the door open, she discovered Nina White had actually invited Julian's mother!

Song Peipei greeted her warmly the moment she saw her, even more affectionately than her own mother.

Olivia was just thinking of an excuse to escape when Julian suddenly burst in. Originally irritable, his expression instantly changed when he saw Olivia.

Then...

He enthusiastically greeted Nina White.

Calling her "Auntie" over and over, praising her for being "beautiful," "young," and "elegant."

He charmed Nina White utterly.

Two people who should have ended their relationship met again.

While their mothers were in the restroom—

Julian: "What a coincidence, huh?"

Olivia: "Indeed."

"So... you didn't tell them we 'broke up'?"

Olivia said calmly, "I was too busy and forgot. You didn't say anything either?"

If either of them had come clean, this dinner wouldn't be happening.

Julian: "What do we do now?"

Olivia shrugged. "Tell them the truth when they get back."

The man gritted his teeth.
###Chapter 361

Julian Winston set down his teacup.

His gaze settled on Olivia Lopez's face.

"My mother mentions you often lately."

Olivia raised an eyebrow. "What does she ask?"

She had always respected Sophia Winston.

After all, the woman had gifted her an imperial green jadeite bangle.

That bracelet was still locked in her safe.

Julian cleared his throat. "She asks why you never visit."

"She suspects I've upset you."

Olivia picked up her coffee. "What did you tell her?"

"I said..." He paused deliberately. "I accidentally got you pregnant."

Olivia's hand trembled.

Coffee nearly spilled.

"Are you insane?!"

Julian grinned mischievously. "Just kidding."

His smile faded. "I said I've been too busy with work."

"I neglected you."

"Then got angry first."

"And made you furious."

Olivia snorted softly.

At least he knew to take the blame.

Julian saw her expression soften.

He seized the opportunity. "How about we continue our arrangement?"

He laid out his points logically. "First, if news of our breakup spreads, both our mothers will demand answers."

Olivia fell silent.

Sophia Winston wouldn't yell.

But she'd deliver the most cutting remarks with perfect elegance.

That was the hallmark of an old-school socialite.

Julian continued his analysis. "Second, the endless pressure to marry and have children will follow."

"Neither of us can escape it."

Olivia frowned.

Every word hit its mark.

"Third, finding a new partner is time-consuming and exhausting."

"There aren't many suitable candidates in our circle anyway."

"Maintaining the status quo is simpler."

Olivia had to admit.

He made sense.

But—

"My principle stands." She stated firmly. "No intimacy with business partners."

Julian choked on his tea.

This woman was always so direct.

"Simple." He set his cup down. "We end our business arrangement."

Olivia raised an eyebrow. "Meaning?"

"From now on, we change our relationship."

"Open partners."

"Or more plainly..." He smirked. "Friends with benefits."

Olivia laughed softly. "Quite the scheme, Julian."

"Weren't you enjoying yourself that night?" Julian leaned closer. "My skills aren't bad, are they?"

"Confidence is good." Olivia gave him a cool glance. "Overconfidence is just pathetic."

Julian suddenly gripped her chin.

Forcing her to look at him.

"You were sober that night."

"Why didn't you refuse?"

"Admit it, Olivia." His gaze burned. "You feel something for me."

Olivia was about to retort.

Sophia Winston and Isabella Sullivan returned.

They quickly separated.

Sophia sensed the tension. "Were you arguing?"

Julian stared intently at Olivia.

Waiting for her response.

Olivia took a deep breath.

She offered a perfect smile. "It's nothing. We're fine."

Thus, their business partnership officially became an open arrangement.

…

The memory faded.

Olivia pushed away the man clinging to her. "Enough! Drive!"

"One more kiss…" Julian murmured, still craving more.

Olivia sighed. "You're more clingy than Papu."

Papu was her British pony at the stables.

Gentle and affectionate.

Julian had visited it once.

He'd secretly kicked its hindquarters.

Papu kicked back.

The bruise on his stomach took weeks to fade.

Julian bristled. "Don't compare me to that beast!"

Olivia's gaze dropped.

Lingering on a certain part of him.

"Be grateful Papu isn't fully grown yet."

Julian instinctively crossed his legs. "You wouldn't dare."

Olivia turned to the window. "I can always find a replacement."

Julian fell silent.

"Starting the car now!" He quickly fastened his seatbelt. "Please sit comfortably, Your Highness."

…

Olivia spent three days with Sophia Sullivan.

Julian followed her for all three.

"What's with him?" Sophia sipped chicken soup, glancing at the sulking man in the chair.

Olivia replied calmly. "Sexually frustrated."

Sophia choked coughing.

Julian remained oblivious to their conversation.

He just glared at the soup thermos.

This thing.

It got him kicked out of bed last night—

"Oh no! I forgot to turn off the stove!"

Olivia dashed to the kitchen, leaving him behind.

Julian was completely bewildered.

After lunch.

Sophia set down her bowl. "Can I be discharged today?"

Olivia consulted the doctor.

She received confirmation.

Julian was happier than the patient.

Olivia shot him a warning look.

Julian grinned foolishly.

Unable to hide his thoughts.

Sophia watched, utterly confused.

Something felt off about these two.

After two days resting at home.

The swelling in Sophia's ankle finally subsided.

She retrieved the Entada seeds from the plant base.

Examining them closely.

The pods were damaged.

But the seeds remained intact.

Their dark brown surfaces bore clear patterns.

Extremely rare.

It was a pity she couldn't bring back a whole pod.

Their one-meter length made them impossible to carry.

As she pondered.

A knock suddenly sounded at the door.

She hopped over on one foot to answer.

And froze in surprise.

"Professor?!"
###Chapter 362

Is "silly girl" meant for her?

Alexander Laurent pushed open the lab door.

He saw an opened shipping box placed by the entrance.

Sophia Sullivan had been discharged from the hospital.

He knocked on the door across the hall.

Sophia hopped on one foot to answer it.

"How's your foot?" Alexander stood outside the door.

"The doctor said it's not serious." Sophia leaned against the doorframe.

"Just apply the medicine on time."

She lowered her eyes.

"That day... thank you and Sebastian."

"I couldn't have made it without you both."

Her voice was very soft.

She had even developed a high fever later.

She heard the fever reducer was brought by Alexander.

Though groggy, she remained conscious through the later part of the night.

She knew Alexander had moved her to a sheltered spot.

She knew he and Sebastian had huddled around her for warmth.

She knew they used alcohol to cool her down.

She remembered all of it.

Including everything at the hospital.

Every word was etched in her memory.

Alexander was silent for a moment.

"Hannah called me that day."

"But I didn't answer."

"So I was late."

"Sorry."

His voice was low.

Sophia looked up.

"But you still came."

She gave a slight smile.

"Professor, there's no need to apologize."

"You weren't obligated to save me."

"I'm the one who should be thanking you."

"You've helped me too many times."

"I've lost count."

Her gaze was clear.

Alexander nodded.

"Let's not mention it then."

He turned to go back to his apartment.

He soon returned carrying a shopping bag.

The bag was large but couldn't contain its contents.

A corner of a black plastic bag peeked out.

"What's this?" Sophia blinked.

Alexander handed it to her.

"Open it and see."

Sophia invited him inside.

Alexander changed his shoes with practiced ease.

The black plastic bag was unwrapped layer by layer.

A complete, intact keteleeria fruit appeared.

It was larger and darker in color than the previous one.

Perfectly preserved.

Sophia's eyes widened in shock.

"Professor, where did you find this?"

Her voice trembled.

"Near where we found you."

"There was a grove of keteleeria trees."

Alexander's tone was calm.

Sophia looked down, embarrassed.

"Finding a specimen can add twenty points..."

She explained quietly.

"Pretty smart."

"Knowing to just take the seeds."

Alexander raised an eyebrow.

Sophia didn't dare mention the real reason.

If the fruit had been intact, she might have truly taken the risk.

She looked at the fruit.

"Amidst the withered vines."

"It was well protected."

Alexander paused.

"Then what?" Sophia pressed.

Alexander gave a light laugh.

"I picked it up on my way back."

"Impossible." Sophia shook her head.

"You didn't have anything in your hands then."

"Your bag couldn't have held it either."

Alexander laughed out loud.

"Silly girl."

"Who had time to pick up fruits then?"

He had noted the location and gone back for it later.

Sophia was stunned.

Silly girl?

Was he calling her that?

...

Marcus Lawrence and Hannah Morse came to visit Sophia.

After climbing seven flights, Hannah was panting heavily.

She was also carrying ten pounds of fruit.

Marcus offered to help but was refused.

Hannah glared.

"Who do you think you're looking down on?"

Marcus had no choice but to relent.

He was carrying two large bags himself.

Hannah was drenched in sweat as if it were summer.

Marcus only had a slightly faster heartbeat.

His complexion was normal, his breathing steady.

Sophia hopped on one foot to answer the door.

She had already prepared slippers.

The doctor said she could walk but should avoid putting weight on it.

She hopped into position before carefully setting her injured foot down.

Hannah quickly steadied her.

Marcus copied Hannah, supporting her other side.

Sophia was both touched and amused.

"I just sprained my ankle, I'm not an invalid..."

"Shh! Shh! Shh!" Hannah immediately cut her off.

"Quick, knock on wood! Don't say such things!"

They helped Sophia to the couch.

Sophia tried to get up to fetch water.

Hannah hopped anxiously.

"Don't move with your foot like that!"

"We'll get our own water!"

Marcus nodded vigorously in agreement.

He nodded every time Hannah spoke.

More diligently than a woodpecker.

"Sophia, your foot isn't better yet?"

"Didn't the doctor say it was fine?"

Hannah looked at her worriedly.

Sophia explained softly.

"I can walk, but it's best to rest it for a couple more days."

"Don't dare put too much weight on it."

She pointed to her injured foot.

Marcus looked at the shopping bags.

"What about all these groceries?"

He seemed a bit lost.

They had agreed on this visit earlier.

Sophia had invited them for dinner.

Hannah had agreed immediately.

She had been craving Sophia's cooking for ages.

Naturally, Marcus stayed too.

They had bought groceries on their way.

But now Sophia's foot was不方便.

Hannah, despite her cravings, felt too guilty to let the patient cook.

After a moment of silence, she tentatively suggested.

"Maybe... I could cook?"

Marcus's expression instantly turned strange.

"...Maybe better not?"

"Marcus, what do you mean by that?"

"Is my cooking not good?"

Hannah glared at him.

Marcus didn't dare comment.

"You said last time the rice was well steamed..."

He muttered under his breath.

Hannah snorted lightly.

"It's not as good as Sophia's, but it's not inedible."

"Just the presentation is a bit lacking."

Marcus nodded.

"Yeah, and it gave me gastroenteritis."

"Just didn't quite dehydrate me."

He added.

"The medicine I bought last time isn't finished."

"Might as well use it today, don't let it go to waste."

Hannah was speechless.
###Chapter 363

Sophia Sullivan stood at the kitchen doorway.

She watched the two flustered individuals.

She couldn't help but laugh.

"I'll cook today."

"You two can assist."

Marcus Lawrence and Hannah Morse both sighed in relief.

They exchanged a glance.

A weight lifted from their shoulders.

Sophia was meticulous in her research.

She was equally precise in cooking.

Meat and vegetables had to be washed separately.

Wilted leaves were carefully removed.

Meat had to be sliced along the grain.

Every step had its own method.

Hannah and Marcus never cooked at home.

Now they were being ordered around.

But they had no complaints.

Instead, they found it novel.

Two hours later.

The meal was finally ready.

Hannah placed her hands on her hips.

Her face beamed with pride.

"I contributed to this feast."

She eagerly pulled out her phone.

She took several pictures of the dining table.

She quickly posted them to her social media.

Her father was the first to like it.

Relatives gradually flooded in.

Likes and comments instantly filled the screen.

Hannah grinned from ear to ear.

Marcus looked at her.

The corner of his mouth lifted unconsciously.

...

Two days later.

Sophia's foot injury had fully healed.

Her mobility was restored.

She handed the Keten seeds to the professor.

She successfully received 20 points.

They were the only group to find the rare plant.

Other groups had either given up.

Or found the wrong plant.

The pod Alexander Laurent gave her.

Sophia kept for her own collection.

Life returned to normal.

School, lab, home—the same three points.

The only hassle was the commute.

The lab was in the suburbs.

The round trip by subway took over an hour.

The last train ended early.

It was often impossible to get a taxi at night.

Sophia decided to buy a commuter car.

It didn't need to be expensive.

Just functional.

She had just entertained this thought.

The next day, a car was delivered to her.

"Miss Sophia Sullivan?"

"I'm Easton Shaw, a salesperson from Golden Glory 4S."

"Someone ordered a car for you."

"It's currently parked at the alley entrance."

"Please come with me to sign for it."

The man in a black suit presented his credentials.

His face was plastered with a polite smile.

Sophia only opened the door a crack.

Her expression was calm.

"Who ordered it?"

The salesperson maintained his smile.

"Customer privacy prevents me from disclosing that."

Sophia nodded.

"Then I don't want it."

"You can drive it away."

She made to close the door.

The salesperson hurriedly stopped her.

"It's the latest Maserati model."

"Limited to 50 units worldwide."

"Are you sure you don't want it?"

Sophia's tone was indifferent.

"Something of unknown origin."

"The more expensive it is, the more suspicious."

The salesperson refused to give up.

"It really is a Maserati."

"Come down and see for yourself."

He glanced at the old residential building.

Then he looked at Sophia's face.

He secretly speculated.

Some wealthy man must have taken a liking to her beauty.

Trying to win her over with a car.

Someone actually refusing such good fortune.

It was truly unbelievable.

"Miss Sullivan."

"Playing hard to get is fine."

"But don't overdo it."

"Know when to quit while you're ahead."

He hinted that Sophia shouldn't pretend to be so noble.

Sophia snorted coldly.

She had already guessed who sent the car.

"Step aside."

"I'm closing the door."

The salesperson, seeing her stubbornness, finally grew anxious.

"It was sent by Mr. Ethan Roscente!"

"The CEO of a listed company!"

"Consider yourself lucky he's interested in you!"

Suddenly, yelling came from downstairs.

"Who blocked the alley with a car!"

"Think you're something special driving a Maserati!"

"I'll report you right now!"

Sophia crossed her arms and raised an eyebrow.

"Here, no matter what car you drive."

"Block the road and you'll get yelled at."

The salesperson was dumbfounded.

"You really don't want it?"

Sophia was resolute.

"Drive it away."

The door slammed shut.

The salesperson stood outside.

His face full of disbelief.

Someone actually refused a free Maserati.

Was this woman too full of herself?

He had just left.

Ethan Roscente's call came through.

"Why didn't you accept the car?"

The man's voice was low.

Suppressing anger.

Sophia countered calmly.

"What is our relationship?"

"What right do you have to send me a car?"

"And why should I accept it?"

Ethan was speechless for two seconds.

He gritted his teeth.

"We are friends."

"Can't I give a friend a gift?"

Sophia's tone remained calm.

"If you give a gift, be prepared for rejection."

She hung up directly.

Ethan was so angry he nearly threw his phone.

Outside the door.

Fiona Valentine heard the commotion.

She waited quietly for a moment.

Then she raised her hand and knocked.

"Come in."

Ethan had already regained his composure.

Except for his reddened eyes.

Nothing seemed amiss.

Fiona pushed the door open.

Her smile was gentle.

"Borrowing your study."

"I made oatmeal porridge as thanks."

"Martha said you liked it."

"It's cooled down a bit."

"Eat it while it's warm."

Ethan grunted in acknowledgment.

His expression was unreadable.

"You go out first."

"I still have matters to attend to."

Fiona put down the bowl of porridge.

She nodded obediently.

The moment she turned around.

Her smile vanished completely.

Jealousy flashed in her eyes.

A Maserati.

Far more expensive than her Chanel and Hermès.
###Chapter 364

Ethan ignored Fiona's emotional state.

He left the bowl of oatmeal porridge untouched on the table.

He finished his work and closed his laptop.

His gaze swept over the corner of the desk. The bowl was still sitting there quietly.

The oatmeal was cooked until soft and mushy, dotted with red dates and goji berries. It was much more carefully made than Isabella's attempts.

He was indeed hungry. Picking up the bowl, he could still feel its residual warmth.

He had originally planned to just take a few bites.

But the moment the porridge touched his lips, his movements halted abruptly.

This taste…

He looked down at the bowl, his eyes suddenly intense.

It was too similar.

Exactly the same as what Sophia used to make.

For a fleeting moment, Ethan was disoriented, as if she were still by his side.

When he went downstairs, Fiona was still there.

She sat on the sofa reading a book, her serene profile outlined by the lamplight.

Hearing his footsteps, she looked up.

A faint ripple stirred in her calm eyes, but the flicker of delight was quickly suppressed.

"Finished work?" She put down her book and stood up, a smile touching her lips.

Ethan responded indifferently, "Did you make this oatmeal porridge?"

"Yes. Does it not suit your taste?"

"Was it your first time making it?"

"I've only cooked plain oatmeal before. I followed a recipe today. It was a bit troublesome, but it's good for the stomach."

Ethan's gaze sharpened slightly. "Who did you learn it from?"

"There's a book on stomach-friendly porridge recipes on the shelf," she said, pointing with a smile. "I just tried it. Was the taste acceptable?"

Ethan gave a noncommittal hum and said nothing more.

Fiona took the hint and said her goodbyes.

As she left, she saw Martha coming downstairs with the empty bowl. A silent smile curved her lips.

…

Sophia decided to buy a car.

This thought became overwhelmingly strong one late night when she couldn't get a taxi after leaving the lab.

She had to buy one! Immediately! Right now!

Early the next morning, she made an appointment with Olivia and headed straight to a car dealership.

"Vivi, I'm here. Where are you?" Sophia stood at the entrance, calling.

"Sorry, Clara. Something urgent came up at the company. I can't make it."

Just as Sophia was about to reply, she saw Alexander Laurent walking towards her.

The voice on the phone continued, "But my brother is here. He knows about cars. He won't let you get ripped off."

Sophia paused.

The man was tall and imposing. His gold-rimmed glasses couldn't conceal his commanding presence.

It was her first time buying a car. Having someone knowledgeable along would indeed be better.

"...Clara, put me on speaker. Brother, I'm entrusting Clara to you. You must take good care of her today, understand?"

Sophia's ears felt slightly warm.

Alexander cleared his throat. "...Don't worry."

The call ended.

Sophia put away her phone. "Sorry to trouble you again, Professor."

"It's no trouble. Do you have any preferred models?"

"Just something easy to drive."

"I'd recommend a sedan. They handle better than SUVs, though the space is smaller. If it's just for commuting, a sedan is sufficient."

"Okay." Sophia readily agreed.

"Any brand preferences?"

"Not really, but I like German cars."

Alexander's eyebrow quirked slightly.

What a coincidence.

So did he.

"Budget?"

"I'm flexible."

They entered a Volkswagen dealership.

A salesperson enthusiastically approached them. "What can I help you folks with today?"

Alexander said, "A sedan. Fuel-efficient and easy to drive."

"This Tiguan L is the newly redesigned model. Spacious interior,霸气 exterior…"

Alexander frowned.

Sophia also looked puzzled.

They had asked for a sedan, but he was recommending an SUV.

He introduced a few more models, all urban SUVs.

Alexander spoke up to remind him, "We want a sedan."

"Sedans aren't as impressive as SUVs! Men of status all drive these. Look at these features…"

"It's for this lady to drive."

"Pfft, won't a man end up driving it anyway? Of course, you should choose something a man will find comfortable…"

Alexander turned directly to Sophia. "Shall we try another dealership?"

"Let's go!"

This salesperson was insane.

They left immediately and entered the dealership across the street.

This time, they were greeted by a young woman.

She welcomed them with a smile, offering flower tea and pastries.

Worried Sophia might be cold, she特意 turned up the air conditioning.

After Sophia stated her requirements, the girl took careful notes.

"I'd recommend these few models. They're all easy-to-drive, fuel-efficient sedans, each with its own characteristics. Would you like me to show you the actual cars?"

The girl was professional and efficient. Sophia was equally decisive.

"Made your choice?" Alexander asked.

"This one. I'll pay by card."

She had made her decision in just fifteen minutes.

The girl was a little surprised. "Wouldn't you like to look at others?"

"No need. Can I pick it up today?"

"We have one in stock from last month. If you don't mind…"

"I don't mind."

It was the first time the girl had encountered such a decisive customer.

As she handed over the contract, she couldn't help smiling and asking, "Are you two newlyweds? You make a really lovely couple."
###Chapter 365

Sophia Sullivan was choosing a car.
Alexander Laurent stayed quietly by her side.

He didn't speak much.
But he noticed every detail.

Whenever she overlooked a key specification, he would gently remind her.

An ordinary friend wouldn't be this attentive.

From the moment they entered the dealership, his gaze was fixed on her.

That level of focus couldn't be faked.

The salesgirl couldn't help but smile. "Are you two here to pick out a wedding car?"
She had seen too many newlyweds who acted just like this.

Sophia's ears grew warm. "You've misunderstood," she quickly denied.

The girl immediately apologized.

Alexander offered no explanation.
His gaze remained gentle.

Confusion flickered in the girl's eyes. Weren't they a couple?

...

Across the street, Irene Valdemar had just finished a spa treatment and was about to leave.
Her eyes swept over the Mercedes-Benz showroom and suddenly stopped.

She adjusted her sunglasses for a better look.

It was Alexander Laurent!

A woman stood beside him. Her profile looked somewhat familiar.

Irene immediately pulled out her phone and snapped several pictures.
She sent them to Sylvia Laurent without hesitation.

[Sylvia, is this Alexander?]
[Does he have a girlfriend now?]

...

At the spa, Sylvia Laurent was enjoying a massage.
Her phone vibrated. She glanced at it casually.

The next second, she bolted upright.
Her face mask slipped off, but she didn't care.

She immediately replied, asking for the location.
The pin dropped quickly.

"Mrs. Laurent, is everything alright?" the other socialites asked with concern.

"It's nothing," Sylvia said, forcing a smile. "Just a small emergency."

She threw off the blanket, slipped on her shoes, and hurried out.
"Put today's charges on my account. Everyone, enjoy yourselves!"

The socialites exchanged puzzled looks.

The aesthetician stood frozen.
Mrs. Laurent's face mask was still on!

Sylvia rushed straight to the location.

"Where are they?" she asked, slightly out of breath upon arrival.

Irene was surprised. "That was fast!"

Sylvia looked toward the dealership across the street. "Are they inside?"

Irene shook her head. "They just left."

Sylvia frowned.
She would never mistake that woman's back in the photo.

It was that tea master!

"Were they here to buy a car?"

Irene nodded. "A white Mercedes C-Class. It seemed the woman was buying it."

Sylvia's face darkened.

"Is Alexander really seeing someone?" Irene ventured.

Sylvia waved a hand dismissively. "It's fine…"
She clearly didn't want to discuss it.

"Shall we go shopping?" Irene suggested.

Sylvia turned to leave. "I have other matters."

Irene watched her hurried departure and suddenly paused.
She opened the photos again.

That silhouette… why did it look so much like the girl who was shoe shopping with her son recently?

She shook her head.

Impossible.

How could her son be fooled by someone like that?

She must be seeing things.

...

After picking up her car, Sophia drove back to their apartment complex.
Their building didn't have assigned parking, so she had to use the lot across the street.

Alexander suggested she rent a space.

The paperwork took an hour.

Alexander walked her to her building's entrance before heading home.

He had just picked up the watering can when urgent knocking sounded at his door.

He was surprised to find Sylvia Laurent there. "Mom?"

"Can't I visit?" Sylvia brushed past him into the apartment.
Her eyes scanned the room.

Alexander instantly understood her purpose.

"What are you really here for?" His voice grew low.

Sylvia gave a dry laugh. "The weather's turning cold. I came to check on you."

She inspected the living room carefully.

No signs of a woman.
Only one mug.
A single set of towels.

Had she really misjudged him?

Alexander crossed his arms. "Satisfied?"

Sylvia smiled awkwardly. "It seems you're doing well."

Alexander's lips twitched.
He'd been independent for years. Her concern now felt far too late.

"I have work to attend to."

Sylvia nodded sheepishly. "I'll be going then."

She pulled the door open.

At that exact moment, the door next door also opened.

Sophia Sullivan and Sylvia Laurent came face to face.

They both froze.
###Chapter 366

Sylvia Laurent knew Sophia Sullivan lived in this building.

But she never expected them to be direct neighbors.

No wonder her son's apartment showed no signs of a woman.

They lived so close.

They could move in together anytime.

A date was just two steps away.

Why would he leave evidence for her to find.

Sylvia studied Sophia.

From head to toe.

Sophia was equally surprised.

This woman leaving the professor's apartment.

Was the wealthy lady from her tea class.

What was her relationship with Professor Laurent?

Alexander Laurent hurried out after her.

Mom, you forgot your bag.

Mom.

Sophia was stunned.

Silence fell among the three.

The atmosphere turned awkward.

Sylvia's gaze was critical and inspecting.

Sophia sensed her hostility.

Alexander recovered first.

He introduced them.

Mom, this is my neighbor, Sophia Sullivan.

Sophia, this is my mother.

Sylvia nodded with a faint, ambiguous smile.

Her eyes were probing.

Sophia offered a slight smile.

She greeted her calmly and politely.

Hello.

And that was it.

Sylvia was taken aback.

This girl made no effort to charm her future mother-in-law.

Just a simple hello.

No sweet talk.

No affectionate gestures.

Not even a proper smile.

Sophia recognized the dislike.

She didn't understand why.

But she saw no need to force warmth.

She had tried hard with Victoria Roscente for six years.

All she got was humiliation, curses, and discord.

After the breakup, she realized.

You can't make everyone like you.

And you shouldn't force yourself to like everyone.

It's okay to face dislike.

And to allow yourself to dislike others.

Clearly, she and Mrs. Laurent weren't meant to get along.

Basic courtesy was enough.

Professor, I won't disturb you both.

Goodbye.

She smiled and closed her door.

Sylvia's eyes widened.

She was still here.

And the door was shut.

Alexander began to close his door too.

Aren't you leaving?

How dare you shut the door before I'm gone!

Sylvia raised her voice.

Alexander looked puzzled.

The heat will escape if I leave it open.

Tell the driver to go slow on the way back.

The roads are slippery with snow.

He handed her the bag, closed the door, and went inside.

Sylvia was so angry she nearly stomped her heel through the floor.

Both of them.

Her own son was worse than useless.

Sophia's foot was almost healed.

She planned to go to the hospital for a check-up.

She just stepped out with her backpack.

And ran into Alexander.

Where are you going?

The hospital for a follow-up.

They went downstairs and crossed the street together.

Sophia went to the garage to get her car.

She was still unfamiliar with the new vehicle.

She almost scraped the car next to hers while pulling out.

Alexander warned her just in time, avoiding a collision.

She had only driven a short distance after buying it yesterday.

He had parked it in the garage for her.

Sitting in the driver's seat, she awkwardly rubbed her nose.

She hadn't driven much since getting her license.

Alexander locked his car and walked to the passenger side.

He opened the door and got in.

Sophia was confused.

Alexander explained.

I don't trust you driving alone with your skills.

I'll accompany you to the hospital as practice.

Sophia was tempted.

She felt nervous driving alone.

Having an experienced driver beside her helped.

But aren't you busy?

Alexander said he wasn't rushing any projects this week.

Sophia overlooked one thing.

If he wasn't busy, why was he in the garage getting his car?

The road to the hospital had many intersections.

She slowly got used to it during the red light buffers.

She drove very carefully.

Alexander guided her from the passenger seat.

He reminded her to use turn signals and check mirrors.

His patience was evident.

Sophia changed lanes several times without checking the blind spot.

It was very dangerous.

Alexander held his breath, his tone serious.

Don't ever do that again.

Sophia quickly apologized.

At the next intersection, she almost forgot again while changing lanes.

Sophia.

She only reacted after his reminder.

Alexander sighed softly.

Can you remember now?

Yes.

Sophia nodded.

She prepared to be scolded.

But he only said her name sternly.

The professor's temper was truly too good.

At the hospital, the doctor ordered tests.

The results came out at eleven-thirty.

It was the attending physician from her previous hospitalization.

No major issues.

Just avoid jumping to prevent re-injury.

Get plenty of rest and eat light foods.

No medication was prescribed.

Sophia pointed to a spot near her ankle.

Is it normal for this area to feel sore when pressed?
###Chapter 367

Alexander Laurent frowned slightly. "Can traditional Chinese medicine speed up recovery?"

"It can be supportive, but rest is still key."

After leaving the hospital, Alexander suddenly turned his head. "Taking you somewhere."

Sophia Sullivan looked up. "?"

Twenty minutes later, the black sedan stopped at the mouth of a narrow alley.

Alexander led her along the cobblestone path.

Deep in the alley was an old-fashioned herbal clinic.

"Jishi Tang?" Sophia gazed at the sandalwood signboard.

Alexander pushed the door open. "Master Luca?"

The courtyard was silent.

He called again. "Master Luca?"

"Coming, coming—"

A cloth curtain moved, and an elderly man with white hair shuffled out. He wore an indigo cotton jacket, a silver beard reaching his chest, and a herb-stained apron tied at his waist.

"You rascal! Haven't seen you for half a year, and you show up yelling!" The old man's eyes suddenly widened. "Oh? Brought a young lady?"

Alexander immediately introduced her.

Master Luca was the former director of the city's traditional Chinese medicine hospital. He retired and now practiced here in seclusion. At ninety years old, he limited himself to thirty patients a day. Appointments were extremely hard to get.

"What seems to be the trouble, young lady?"

Sophia was surprised. "How did you know I was the one needing treatment?"

The old man glanced at Alexander. "This boy dodges needles. No way he'd come here willingly."

Sophia suppressed a laugh. "The professor is afraid of acupuncture?"

"...Ahem."

The tips of Alexander's ears turned slightly red. He quickly explained the injury. "She sprained her ankle a week ago. The swelling's gone down, but there's still tenderness."

The old man motioned for Sophia to sit. His aged fingers gently pressed her ankle. "Does this hurt?"

"No."

"How about here?"

"A little."

Three fingers rested on her wrist, taking her pulse. The old man pondered for a moment. "No serious damage, but there's a blockage in your qi and blood flow. One session of acupuncture should provide relief."

Sophia looked at the silver needle case, her fingertips turning cold. "Will it hurt?"

"Don't worry. It'll feel like a tiny ant bite."

Alexander reassured her softly. "It'll be over quickly."

"You've never tried it yourself..."

Alexander fell silent.

The old man laughed heartily.

The silver needles gleamed coldly as they were laid out. Instinctively, Sophia grabbed the hand beside her.

Alexander clasped her hand in return.

"Close your eyes and relax." The old man's voice was kind.

A slight pricking sensation touched the top of her head, then faded.

"First needle is done."

Sophia wanted to open her eyes but was gently stopped. "Wait a bit longer."

In the darkness, her senses heightened. She gripped the man's hand tightly, her knuckles turning white.

"You can open your eyes now."

The mirror reflected her head full of silver needles. She looked like a bristly little hedgehog.

The old man pointed to a therapy bed in the inner room. "Help her over to lean back."

Sophia then realized she had been holding Alexander's hand the entire time. Their palms were slightly damp and warm from the shared grip.

Alexander steadily supported her arm, helping her shuffle step by step toward the inner room.

Master Luca carefully protected the needles in her hair.

They both held their breaths for those few short steps.

They both let out a sigh of relief once she was finally seated.

The old man smiled and directed, "Alexander, help the young lady with her shoe. Gently place her foot on the support."

Alexander knelt on one knee. He cradled her heel in his palm and carefully removed her boot.
###Chapter 368

Sophia Sullivan stood frozen.

She couldn't move.

Words of refusal stuck in her throat.

The man had already bent down to remove her shoes.

Her socks were gently taken off as well.

She looked down at Alexander Laurent.

His expression was as focused as if he were operating precision instruments.

Sophia's breath hitched.

Her heart inexplicably raced.

She had never deeply considered why he treated her so specially.

Perhaps it was because he was inherently gentle.

Sincere with everyone.

But at this moment, she clearly realized.

The professor was indeed different with her.

Even the kindest person.

Wouldn't go to this extent for a stranger.

After the shoes and socks were removed.

Alexander followed the old master's instructions.

Carefully holding her slender ankle.

His palm was slightly cool.

When his fingertips touched the top of her foot.

It felt like an electric current passed through.

Both of them froze simultaneously.

The skin under his fingers was smooth and delicate.

Alexander's Adam's apple moved.

He struggled to suppress the emotions surging in his eyes.

Sophia couldn't describe the sensation either.

A mix of itchiness and burning heat.

Unclear if it came from him or herself.

She instinctively wanted to pull her foot back.

But remembered the old master's instructions.

She forced herself to stay still.

Their unusual expressions drew attention.

The auntie organizing herbs glanced over curiously.

"How unusual today."

"Alexander is this close and hasn't fainted at the sight of needles?"

When he accompanied Sylvia here before.

He would stay far away at the sight of acupuncture tools.

Even a glance would make him uncomfortable.

But today...

"It really is different when accompanying his girlfriend!"

The auntie smiled, wrinkles gathering at the corners of her eyes.

Her expression was particularly kind.

Sophia couldn't move or speak.

She could only pretend not to hear.

Alexander cleared his throat lightly.

His gaze drifted elsewhere.

Master Luca noticed their embarrassment.

He spoke up just in time to diffuse the situation.

"Is the Pseudostellaria heterophylla for tomorrow ready?"

"Several returning patients need it in their prescriptions."

The auntie wanted to continue gossiping.

But ultimately prioritized work.

She turned to prepare the herbs in the storage room.

After the plaster was applied to her ankle.

A warm sensation quickly spread.

The swelling and pain noticeably eased.

"Keep it on for twelve hours before removing."

"Avoid getting it wet during that time."

"Try not to stand for long periods recently."

The old master followed them to the door, repeatedly reminding her.

Sophia nodded earnestly.

"I've remembered everything. Thank you."

The auntie suddenly rushed out from the inner room.

She shoved several packages of herbs into Sophia's hands.

"This is..." Sophia looked puzzled.

"Master Luca says you have qi deficiency and yin depletion."

"You suffer during your menstrual cycle."

"He specifically prescribed medicine for regulation."

"Brewing instructions are written on the packages."

The auntie affectionately held Sophia's hand.

Lowering her voice.

"I've never seen Alexander so concerned about anyone before."

"Girls need to take good care of their health."

"It'll make having children easier later..."

Sophia and Alexander exchanged a glance.

Both extremely embarrassed.

Master Luca couldn't bear to watch.

"Alexander knows his own limits."

"You focus on managing the herbs."

The return journey was unusually quiet.

Alexander walked her to her door.

Remembering the earlier scene, he explained.

"Auntie Zoe means well."

"She just loves prying into others' business."

Sophia remained silent.

The explanation only made it more awkward.

Fortunately, it didn't affect her mood.

That night, she strictly followed the medical advice.

She kept the plaster on and avoided water.

Before bed, she massaged the acupoints on her legs.

The next morning when she removed the plaster.

Pressing on her ankle caused no pain.

She excitedly knocked on her neighbor's door.

Alexander had just opened it when he saw her beaming.

"Master Luca's plaster is amazing!"

"The swelling went down in just one night."

"I can even jump around without pain now!"

She was about to demonstrate on the spot.

Alexander helplessly held her shoulders.

"I believe you."

"No need to prove it."

"The old master said to avoid prolonged standing."

"Don't put too much pressure on the injured area."

Sophia nodded obediently.

Meeting his amused eyes.

She belatedly realized how childish she had just been.

She sheepishly touched the tip of her nose.

Alexander watched her little mannerism.

The corners of his mouth unconsciously lifted.

Mid-January brought final exams.

Exam week lasted seven days.

Sophia didn't have tests every day.

On free days, she immersed herself in the lab.

Winter break officially began after finals.

But the holiday held no special meaning for her.

She still left early and returned late.

The only change was not attending classes.

Her daily routine simplified to home and lab.

Hannah Morse couldn't help but remark.

"Aren't you taking any break after exams, Sophia?"

"I want to finish this phase of experiments quickly."

"Try to advance to the next research stage before the new year."

"You're too dedicated."

"I was planning a trip nearby before the new year."

"Your data isn't urgent."

"But if we all go and leave you alone..."

"It's fine."

"Is Marcus going too?"

"He volunteered as a free guide!"

Might as well take advantage.

"Hope you have fun."

"Nothing's decided yet."

"We might not end up having time."

Before the cold front hit the north.

Sophia was glad she had bought a car early.

And grateful for Alexander's weekend practice sessions.

A patient teacher and a quick learner.

She soon could drive to and from alone.

Her commute time shortened significantly.

The ride experience improved markedly.

The only inconvenience was how early it got dark.

When she drove toward the suburbs after experiments.

The night was deep, with few people and cars.
###Chapter 369

Marcus Lawrence had taken a leave of absence for family matters and hadn't been to the lab for several days.

The moment the clock struck five, Hannah Morse slung her bag over her shoulder.
"Sophia, I've got plans. Heading out!"

"Okay," Sophia Sullivan replied, turning to see Hannah clutching a soda cracker.
It was a low-calorie snack, probably just to curb a craving.

"Be safe," Sophia reminded her before returning to her data analysis.

After Hannah left, the lab fell into complete silence.

Sophia became utterly absorbed in the data, losing all track of time.

When she finally looked up, darkness had fallen outside the window.

She powered down the instruments, tidied the common area, and grabbed the trash on her way out.

Sophia slid into the driver's seat and started the car with practiced ease.

The vehicle merged smoothly into the traffic.

At an intersection, she checked the navigation and made a right turn.

The roadside trees were bare, their skeletal branches swaying under the streetlights, making the area seem desolate.

Sophia signaled and merged into the right lane.

Once cruising steadily, she turned on some music.

Soft melodies filled the car, creating a relaxing atmosphere.

Suddenly, Sebastian Evans called.

"Busy?"

His voice was deep, laced with amusement.

The familiar tone and casual opener effortlessly bridged the distance between them.

"Just left the lab. On my way home."

Sebastian glanced out his window, his brow furrowing slightly.

"The weather's turning nasty tonight. Might snow. Drive carefully."

"Got it," Sophia acknowledged.

Sebastian got to the point. "The equipment you ordered arrived. Will anyone be at the lab tomorrow? I'll schedule the delivery."

His company, Helios Technologies, had extensive procurement channels.
Sophia's imported instruments were almost always ordered through him.

He'd once joked, "Thanks for the business, boss. More orders mean more commission for me!"

Sophia knew he was teasing.

Commission?

She'd checked the prices. Sebastian gave her the lowest rates possible.

So low there was no room for any commission.

At least he wasn't losing money on the deals.

Otherwise, Sophia would have stopped ordering from him.

Sebastian knew the difference between a one-time feast and a steady meal.

This equipment had been ordered back in November.
After such a long wait, its arrival made Sophia's spirits soar.

"Tomorrow works! I'll be at the lab all day. What time approximately?"

"Around ten in the morning. Is that okay?"

"Perfect. Thanks again for your help. I owe you a meal." The thought of using the new equipment tomorrow made her voice light and cheerful.

It was the latest microbial observation instrument from fn GmbH in Germany.
Released less than two months ago, it was in high demand by labs worldwide.

Without connections, it was nearly impossible to acquire.

Thanks to Sebastian's contacts, Sophia had gotten hers early.

Sebastian was infected by her cheerfulness, a smile touching the corners of his eyes.

"Rare for you to offer a meal. How about next weekend? I'll book it now, so you can't back out later."

Just as Sophia was about to reply, blinding high beams suddenly pierced the darkness ahead.

The intense light temporarily blinded her.

By the time her vision cleared, a loud CRASH echoed.
###Chapter 370

She slammed on the brakes.

Had she hit something?

Sophia gripped the steering wheel tightly, frozen in shock.

On the other end, Sebastian heard the tremendous impact first, then silence from Sophia—

"Sophia?! Can you hear me?! Sophia!!"

He immediately knew something was wrong.

He grabbed his car keys and bolted out the door.

Once in his car, he started the engine while dialing—

"Find Sophia Sullivan's exact location within five minutes... And have a team on standby, ready to go..."

Meanwhile, Sophia, still shaken, looked out her window.

Cautiously, she didn't exit the vehicle immediately, first ensuring all doors and windows were locked.

She took a deep breath, forcing herself to stay calm.
Sophia Sullivan quickly regained her composure.

The high beams flashed, blinding her momentarily.

She slammed on the brakes instinctively.

The sound of impact echoed.

But she was certain she hit an object, not a person.

Why was there something on the road?

Just before the high beams lit up, the road was clearly empty.

Unless…

It appeared out of nowhere.

Ruling out the supernatural, only one possibility remained—it was deliberate.

Sophia waited in the car for five minutes.

There was no movement.

She decided to get out and investigate.

She grabbed her phone and retrieved a folding knife from the glove compartment.

The blade was compact, easily concealed in her palm.

Exiting the car, she scanned her surroundings first.

Two overhead streetlights were broken, casting a dim glow.

There was a scratch on the front bumper.

She had hit a metal crate.

The crate was rusted, with visible weld marks and several dents that had been hammered out.

Sophia frowned.

A metal crate in the middle of the road late at night?

It felt like it was placed there just for her.

She immediately took photos for evidence.

Just as she was about to return to her car, her phone rang.

It was Sebastian Evans.

She moved to answer, but three men suddenly rushed from the trees beyond the guardrail.

Sophia instantly reached for the car door.

One of them was faster, shoving the door shut.

It slammed closed with force.

"You're blocking my door," Sophia said, looking up, her tone even.

All three men had square jaws and upturned eyes, resembling family.

The one blocking the door was a tall, lean middle-aged man.

He sneered. "Think you can just hit something and drive off? Not that easy!"

A heavier man chimed in. "Yeah!"

An older man threw himself onto the hood, clutching the metal crate and wailing. "Our heirloom is ruined! I can't face our ancestors!"

The heavier man rushed to support the older man. "Dad, don't do this!"

The lean man kept the door blocked. "You have to pay! You must compensate us!"

Sophia understood.

This was a setup.

She gave a light laugh. "A metal crate is an heirloom? Do I look that easy to fool?"

The lean man snorted. "The treasure is inside the crate! Big brother, show her!"

The heavier man opened the crate, revealing a pile of fragments.

"This is a Tang Dynasty blue and white porcelain! Passed down for generations! It's auction-house quality!"

The older man puffed on a pipe. "Young lady, we're not trying to cause trouble. But this treasure is something our whole family venerates. We hardly dared to touch it."

Sophia countered calmly, "If it's such a venerated treasure, why was it in the middle of the road at midnight? And inside a metal crate?"

The older man sighed. "We were moving today. It was temporarily stored in the crate. We were waiting by the roadside for a ride when you swerved and hit it. We almost died!"

"I was driving straight, never veered to the side. How could I have hit something on the roadside?" Sophia's gaze was sharp. "Unless the crate was already in the middle of the road."

The lean man roared, "Are you saying we're scamming you?"

Sophia replied coolly, "Aren't you?"

"Fine! We are scamming you! You're not leaving today without paying!"

Sophia's expression turned cold. "If we can't agree, let's call the police. There are traffic cameras on this stretch, and my car has a dash cam. We'll see what really happened."

The lean man's face changed.

The older man hurriedly tried to mediate. "Young lady, just pay a little something, and we can all walk away."

Sophia subtly stepped back.

The lean man immediately advanced.

She pulled out her phone to call the police.

The lean man snatched it from her hand. "You refuse the easy way? Fine! If you don't hand over five hundred thousand today, I'll slash your pretty face!"
###Chapter 371

The fat man tore off his disguise.
"We've been polite enough to you!"
"In our village, a disobedient woman like you would have had her legs broken already."
"Hand over five hundred thousand, and we'll leave immediately."

The old man feigned a sigh.
"Why make this so difficult, girl?"
"If you had listened to our advice, it wouldn't have come to this."
"We only want money."
"You drive a Mercedes. Five hundred thousand is nothing to you."
"Once we have the money, we guarantee you'll leave safely."

Sophia Sullivan was taken aback by their audacity.
They couldn't even be bothered to maintain their pretense.
This was clearly a robbery.

She understood the principle of paying to avoid disaster.
But five hundred thousand was absolutely impossible.
She said coldly, "Thirty thousand, at most. Take it or leave it."

"Thirty thousand? You think we're beggars?"
"A single part from this car is worth more than thirty thousand!"
"This woman won't be reasonable until she suffers a little!"

The tall, thin man raised his hand menacingly.
As his palm was about to strike, a force intercepted it.
The next second, he was kicked flying.

Sebastian Evans retracted his leg.
He stared coldly at the man sprawled on the ground.
"Lay a hand on her? You're not worthy."

He turned to Sophia, his voice urgent.
"Are you hurt?"

Sophia had been shielding her head.
The expected pain never came.
Instead, she heard Sebastian's voice.

Her head snapped up.
She met a pair of eyes filled with concern.

"How did you get here?" she blurted out.

Sebastian laughed in exasperation.
"If I hadn't come, was I supposed to wait for them to extort you?"

"No…" Sophia pressed her lips together awkwardly.
"I mean, how did you find this place?"

"You screamed and then hung up on the phone."
"You didn't answer when I called back."
"Did you think I wouldn't worry?"

"Sorry, I—"

Sebastian cut her off.
"You're not the one who should be apologizing."

His icy gaze swept over the three men.
The kicked thin man scrambled to hide behind his father and brother.

"How… how could you hit someone?" the fat man blustered.

Sebastian smirked coldly.
"Not only will I hit someone, I'll hit you next. Believe me?"

The other man fell silent.

Three or four dark figures quickly surrounded them.
They trapped the father and his three sons in the middle.

"What are you trying to do?!"

Sebastian took off his jacket.
He wrapped it tightly around Sophia.
He made a gesture to the dark figures.

The father and sons were immediately dragged away.

Sebastian looked at Sophia.
"Were you scared?"

"Not really, because—"

She opened her palm.
A folded knife lay inside.

"I had this."

Sebastian's heart clenched.
"Getting bold, are we? Planning to go down fighting?"

"Not that far." She smiled faintly.
"A last resort."

He laughed angrily, a trace of fear hidden in his eyes.
"If they want money, just give it to them."
"Your life is more important than money!"
"Why pick a fight with people like this?"

Sophia nodded, looking innocent.
"I did offer."

"You said you only had thirty thousand…"

"They wanted five hundred thousand."
"If I gave in too easily, they'd think they asked for too little."
"They'd get greedier next time."
"I had to let them know the money wouldn't be easy to get."

"They asked for five hundred thousand, and you bargained down to thirty?" Sebastian was utterly speechless.

Sophia coughed lightly.
"My WeChat balance only had thirty thousand."

"And this knife?" Sebastian took the folded knife.
He flicked it open with his fingertip.

Hiss!

The blade gleamed coldly.

Sophia's lips tightened.
Her expression turned grim.
"What if they didn't want money?"
"When money can't buy your life, you need to keep an ace up your sleeve."

Sebastian fell silent.

Sophia continued, "That's why I said it was the last step."

Using it was a choice.
Being prepared was another matter entirely.

Sebastian sighed softly.
It was as if he was seeing her in a new light.

"The paint on your front bumper is scratched."
"Should I call the dealership to tow it?"

"Okay."

Sebastian opened the car door.
"I'll drive you back."

Sophia instinctively pulled his jacket tighter.
Her movement suddenly stilled.

The fabric still held the warmth of his body.
###Chapter 372

Sophia Sullivan turned her head.

Sebastian Evans met her gaze. "?"

"Mr. Evans, I've caused you trouble again."

He paused briefly, then a soft smile touched his lips. "I don't mind."

She looked down. "Your feelings... all I can do is say thank you. I can't return them. Is it really worth it?"

Her words carried a deeper meaning.

He hadn't expected her to be so direct. After a moment, his smile remained. "You've always been clear-headed. So am I. You have the right to refuse. I have the freedom to persist. I've always believed—"

Sophia looked up.

His eyes held hers, each word deliberate. "Where sincerity reaches, even metal and stone can crack. If it hasn't happened yet, the timing just isn't right."

"What if the right time never comes?"

"Then I'll wait forever."

"You'll get hurt," she said softly.

"I can take the loss," he replied without hesitation.

Sophia slid into the passenger seat. She took off his jacket, smoothed out the wrinkles carefully, and handed it back to him.

Sebastian gestured for her to put it in the back. He started the car and drove away from the scene.

As they talked about the accident, Sophia mentioned casually,

"...Luckily Professor Laurent taught me how to handle sudden high beams. Otherwise, I might not have hit the brakes. I might have swerved right instinctively..."

To the right was a guardrail. Beyond it, that family of three had been crouched. Anyone stumbling onto the road would have been a disaster.

"Alexander Laurent?" Sebastian caught the key point instantly. "He taught you? How?"

Sophia didn't overthink it. "Professor Laurent has been helping me practice driving lately."

Sebastian's eyes narrowed. His knuckles on the steering wheel whitened slightly. He kept his tone casual. "I thought he was swamped. He has time to coach you?"

"Seems manageable. He's been home on weekends recently."

"Really?" Sebastian's tone was subtle. "He's quite patient."

Mentioning patience, Sophia immediately sat up straighter—

"That time I... and also that other time... Professor Laurent is the most patient instructor I've ever met. His temper is so calm, he never yells. People say he's cold and hard to approach, but I think that's a misunderstanding..."

Sebastian listened to her praise Alexander Laurent endlessly. Outwardly calm, inside he was churning.

Patient?
That was ulterior motives!

Good temper?
Depends on who it is!

At the alley entrance, Sebastian hit the brakes.

The stop was a bit abrupt. Sophia lurched forward before the seatbelt pulled her back.

A flicker of apology passed through Sebastian's eyes. "Sorry."

"It's fine. Thank you for today."

Sophia unbuckled her seatbelt and pushed the door open.

Sebastian said, "If something like this happens again, don't tough it out. If money can solve it, pay. If it can't, buy time."

"Okay. I hope there isn't a next time."

"Wait." Sebastian spoke suddenly, getting out of the car after her.

Sophia turned back. "?"

"I'll walk you up."

"No need—"

Before she finished, a figure silhouetted against the light in the distance moved. "Sophia?"

The person hidden in the shadows stepped forward. Their form gradually became clear,轮廓 sharp.

"Professor?" Sophia was surprised.

Alexander Laurent walked up to them. His gaze swept lightly over Sebastian Evans.

Their eyes met. Undercurrents stirred in Alexander's eyes.

The corner of Sebastian's mouth lifted slightly. He met the gaze directly, a hint of unspoken challenge in his look.

Alexander looked away, turning to Sophia. "Did something happen on the road? You're two hours later than usual."

Late winter, deep night. The old neighborhood was deserted. Streetlights flickered. Worried about her safety, Alexander came down to wait for her whenever he had time.

Sophia's arrival time varied, but usually within half an hour. Today was two hours late.

And she got out of Sebastian Evans's car.

He guessed there must have been trouble on the road.

The night wind was biting. Alexander saw her nose was red from the cold. "Let's go inside. It's cold out."

Sophia nodded, blowing on her icy hands. She turned to say goodbye to Sebastian.

Under the streetlight, two figures walked side by side. Their steps were strangely in sync.

The motion-activated lights in the stairwell lit up floor by floor. Faint murmurs could be heard.

Sebastian stood still, watching the direction they left. His mind replayed the look of pure admiration in Sophia's eyes when she talked about Alexander Laurent. His expression darkened.

Last time, because of his friendship with Ethan Roscente, he hesitated and was a step too late. Was he going to watch her walk toward someone else again?

He originally wanted to take it slow, wait for things to happen naturally. But at this moment, Sebastian didn't want to wait any longer.

Waiting any longer might lead to complications.

He had already paid for his past hesitation with six years. He finally waited for her to part ways with Ethan.

Making the same mistake once was an accident. Making it twice was stupidity.

The moment he turned, the gloom in the man's eyes turned into resolve. It was as if he had made up his mind!

...

Winter, twenty-fifth day. Minor Cold.

As the saying goes, Minor Cold, Major Cold, freeze into a ball.

It was also the second to last solar term before New Year's Eve.

For Sophia Sullivan, today held another special meaning—

Her birthday.

Early morning, the first well-wisher was her father, David Sullivan.

Sophia was still in bed when the video call came—

"Happy birthday, sweetie!"

"Thanks, Dad~"

"Your birthday gift was delivered. Remember to pick it up at the station." On screen, David wore an apron. The background was the beige kitchen tiles of their villa.

"There's a gift too? What is it?"

David chuckled. "Open it and see!"

"Keeping it a secret?" Sophia rolled over in bed, wrapping herself tightly in the comforter like a cocoon.

"Secret? Whose secret?" Isabella Sullivan leaned into the frame.

David: "A little secret between father and daughter. No snooping~"

Isabella: "What secret could you have? You just bought a new—"

"Hey! Don't say it! The surprise is ruined..."

Sophia blinked. "A new what? A computer? An iPad?"

David's eyes widened. "How did you know? Did you peek at my shopping history?"

Last week, Sophia had mentioned offhandedly that she wanted an iPad mini for portability. She didn't expect David not only to remember but actually buy it...

"Thank you, Dad! This is really practical. I love it!"

"Hehe... I wanted it to be a surprise. Your mom ruined it..."

Isabella laughed. "Your dad really went all out this time. Did his research early. Someone who never watches live streams camped out for half a day just to grab a coupon. Paid for it with his private stash in the end."

He was heartbroken about it...
###Chapter 373

"Happy birthday, sweetheart."
Isabella Sullivan's voice was apologetic.
"The publisher just notified me they're doing another print run of 'Seven Days'."
"Three huge boxes of title pages arrived for signing. I simply can't get away."

Her new book was already on its third printing.
The mountain of title pages waiting for signatures filled her study.
A sweet burden for a bestselling author.

Sophia Sullivan's eyes curved into happy crescents.
"My mom is a famous author now. It's only normal for her to be busy!"

Her tone was playful, filled with a daughter's particular pride.

Isabella laughed.
"A few days ago, a reader somehow got my number."
"They immediately asked for a personalized signed book. Offered a hundred thousand."

David Sullivan was drinking tea nearby.
He nearly choked.

A single written blessing was worth that much?
This world...

"Wow!" Sophia was astonished.
"Then what?"

"Your mother was too stunned to respond."
"The other party thought she was refusing and directly doubled the offer to two hundred thousand."
David still found it unbelievable.

"Did you agree?"

"We signed it."
"But we didn't take the money. We heard they were also from Kyoto."

After hanging up, Sophia saw a package pickup notification.
She struggled out of her warm blankets.
She slipped on her slippers and drew the curtains.

It had snowed again last night.
The world outside her window was blanketed in white.

The doorbell suddenly rang.
Sophia ran to answer it.

Pop!

Colorful streamers flew through the air.
Tiny glittering specks settled in her hair.

Olivia Lopez stood there in a sharp black suit with a red bow tie.
Her hair was elegantly coiffed.
"Ready, princess? Your knight has arrived to escort you."

Sophia instinctively covered her mouth.
She knew Olivia was coming, but she hadn't expected this.

"Surprised? Shocked?"

"Thank you!" Sophia pulled her into a big hug.
"The handsomest Knight Vivi!"

Olivia patted her back gently.
"Don't get emotional yet. This is just the beginning~"
She checked her watch.
"Twenty minutes enough?"

"Plenty!" Sophia dashed back to her room to wash up and change.

Twenty minutes later, she was in Olivia's car.

Downtown, at a top-tier steakhouse—

The door opened.
A single beam of light cut through the dim restaurant.
Crystal chandeliers flickered on one by one.

A silent ceremony welcoming the guest of honor.

Olivia bowed gracefully.
"After you, my princess."

The spotlight moved, perfectly illuminating Sophia.
She followed its path to a window-side table.

Olivia pulled out her chair with impeccable gentlemanly风度.
Then she produced a gift.
"Happy birthday. Want to open it?"

Sophia took the box.
A classic Cartier bracelet lay inside.
Four pink diamonds sparkled.
The initials S.S. were engraved on the inner band.

A symbol of eternal friendship.

"It's beautiful! I love it."

"Here, let me put it on you."

The bracelet slid over her slender wrist.
It contrasted beautifully with her fair skin.

"This piece really suits you!"

Sophia couldn't stop admiring it.

Olivia raised an eyebrow.
"Is that it?"

"Hmm?" Sophia looked up.

There was more?

Olivia smiled mysteriously and nodded to a waiter.
The joyful notes of "Ode to Joy" began to play.

To the music, Alexander Laurent approached, pushing a cake.
A fondant figurine stood atop the pink and white frosting.
Its large, spirited eyes were unmistakably a cartoon version of Sophia.
It was surrounded by delicate pink pearls.

Simple and exquisite.

"Professor?" Sophia was surprised.

The corners of Alexander's lips lifted slightly.

The music swelled.
Warmth filled the air.
In the flickering candlelight, his smile was dazzling.
Sophia was momentarily mesmerized.

Until—

"Happy birthday." He stopped before her and offered a bouquet of blue irises.

Sophia snapped back to reality.
"Thank you, Professor. The flowers and the cake are both so beautiful…"

Blue iris meaning: elegance, vitality, hope, admiration, and enchantment.

Olivia chuckled softly.
"Clara, look a little closer?"

Sophia lowered her gaze to the flowers.

Her eyes stopped—

A small silver box, edged in pink, was nestled among the blooms.

Under their watchful eyes, she opened it.
A necklace glittered inside.

"This is…?"

Olivia: "My brother's birthday gift to you."

The outer band resembled planetary orbits.
Nine diamonds were set along the "orbits" like stars.

Looking closer at their color…

"Fancy color diamonds?!"

They weren't a single hue.
Each diamond shimmered with a kaleidoscope of colors under the light!

Sophia drew a sharp breath.

"Do these occur naturally?"

Alexander shook his head gently.
"Not under natural conditions."

"Then these are…?"

Olivia jumped in.
"My brother synthesized them himself!"

Sophia lifted the necklace toward the light.
It truly was a mix of colors!

"How?" She looked at Alexander, her eyes full of curiosity.

Alexander: "There are two primary methods for lab-grown diamond synthesis—HPHT and CVD."
"A ceramic container uses hydraulic pressure to create extreme pressure."
"Electrical power generates intense heat, causing carbon to form crystals around a natural diamond seed."
"Typically…"

Olivia stood to the side, her head starting to ache.

A romantic gift-giving moment had turned into an academic seminar?
The two principals seemed completely unaware.

One explained with professional detail.
The other listened with rapt attention.

Olivia looked skyward in exasperation.

Have you two forgotten something?
###Chapter 374

The academic discussion finally concluded.

Olivia Lopez let out a long sigh of relief.

"Don't invite me to these academic gatherings next time."

She muttered under her breath.

She raised her hand to signal the server to bring the food.

Everything was Sophia Sullivan's favorite.

After the meal, Olivia wanted to go shopping.

She received a work call just after stepping out of the restaurant.

"Got it! Would waiting one more day kill you?"

She hung up and hurried to the company.

Before leaving, she didn't forget to instruct him.

"Alex, it's Sophia's birthday. Keep her company! Give her anything she wants!"

Alexander Laurent nodded. "Okay."

He watched Olivia leave.

Alexander turned to Sophia. "Where would you like to go?"

Her eyes lit up. "Anywhere?"

Alexander pondered for a moment. "Within my capabilities."

"I want to see where synthetic colored diamonds are made."

"Are you sure?"

"Yes!"

"Alright."

Sophia thought it would be a lab.

Instead, Alexander brought her to a factory.

"Alex! Back again?" The security guard greeted him warmly.

"Uncle Moore, good afternoon. Have you eaten?"

"Yes! The canteen served braised pork knuckles today. Very fragrant! The colored diamond is finished, right? Is your girlfriend satisfied?"

Alexander cleared his throat softly.

Sophia smiled slightly.

The guard finally noticed her.

"Oh! So you're the one he's giving the colored diamond to—"

"Uncle Moore! Could I have the key to workshop seven?" Alexander interrupted him.

"Sure thing!" The guard turned to find the key.

Alexander looked slightly embarrassed. "Uncle Moore likes to joke."

Sophia nodded. "I can tell."

After getting the key, they entered workshop seven.

It wasn't large. There were no workers, only instruments and an operating table.

Alexander stood before the operating table.

"I originally planned to synthesize it in the lab, but wastewater disposal was problematic. I rented this workshop temporarily."

Sophia walked to his side.

The operating table was meticulously clean.

This was very much Alexander's style.

She noticed a ceramic jar in the top left corner of the table.

"What's inside? May I look?"

A flicker of discomfort crossed Alexander's face.

"Of course."

He handed her the jar.

Sophia opened it, her eyes widening instantly.

The jar was more than half full of diamond fragments.

Some had the wrong color. Others were failed cuts.

Some were too large and uneven. Others were too shattered, affecting their beauty.

There were over a hundred pieces in total.

Alexander looked slightly embarrassed. "It was my first time. I failed many attempts."

Sophia looked down at the fragments.

She could almost see the man sitting at the operating table, wearing a mask, focused on cutting under the light.

"Why?" She suddenly looked up, her eyes bright.

Alexander was taken aback.

"Why did you give me the necklace?"

"Because... it's your birthday."

Hearing this answer, a sense of loss washed over Sophia.

The professor was like the moon in the sky—pure and dazzling.

Moonlight falls on everyone equally. How could she be the special one?

A self-mocking smile touched Sophia's lips.

Alexander's breath hitched.

The smile on her lips made his heart flutter anxiously.

It felt like he had missed something important.

It was already evening when they left the factory.

The security guard had been replaced by a shy young man.

He silently took the key and opened the gate for them.

Night was approaching but hadn't fully arrived. The sky was a hazy gray.

Bare branches added a touch of desolation to the dusk.

Sophia and Alexander walked side by side.

Silence enveloped them.

Alexander seemed to want to speak but held back.

He sensed her fluctuating emotions but didn't know the reason.

He could only remain silent.

Suddenly, Sophia looked up with a smile. "Thank you for the birthday gift, Professor. It's very meaningful. I love it. Let me treat you to dinner? What would you like?"

Alexander watched her transition from deep thought to a radiant smile.

He was momentarily stunned.

Sophia spoke again. "Have you decided?"

Alexander: "Sichuan food. Can you handle spice?"

"Sure!"

They emerged from the Sichuan restaurant.

Sophia exhaled a breath and tightened her scarf.

Alexander started to take off his own scarf to drape over her.

Sophia took half a step back. "No need, Professor. I'm not cold."

Alexander looked puzzled.

Sophia was already striding ahead.

The sky was completely dark now. A cold wind blew.

The light from the street lamps was veiled in a light mist.

They walked along the riverbank.

Sophia reached the bridge, her hands in her pockets. She turned back. "Professor, have we walked this path before?"

"Yes." Alexander nodded.

"When?"

"In the summer. I bought you an ice cream."

Sophia laughed. "Your memory is excellent."

Alexander wanted to say he only remembered important things.

But Sophia had already run to a street vendor.

"Two, please. Thank you."

She scanned to pay and ran back to Alexander.

"You bought me ice cream in summer. I'm buying you sweet potatoes in winter. Fair exchange."

Even.

Alexander took it. "Thank you."

It was already ten when they returned to the apartment building.

The moon hung high in the sky.

"Sophia—" Alexander suddenly called out to her.

"Yes, Professor?" Sophia turned around.

"You asked why I gave you the necklace. I want to answer again."

Sophia's heart skipped a beat. "You..."

"Because it's your birthday. I wanted to give you the most special thing. Diamonds are beautiful, but they can be bought with money. They don't deserve you."

"You deserve the best, most unique gift in the world. Because you are unique. You are the best."

"Professor..." Sophia's gaze wavered, feeling both flustered and confused.

Alexander took a deep breath. "There are some things I want to say. I'm afraid to say them. But right now, I really want to tell you. Would you like to hear?"

Sophia met the man's deep eyes.

Her heartbeat quickened uncontrollably.

After a moment, she smiled. "Alright. Say it. I'll listen."
###Chapter 375

Sophia Sullivan stood at the stairwell entrance.

Alexander Laurent gazed at her intently.

"Ever since our first meeting at the café—"

The building's main door suddenly swung open.

Auntie Zoe from downstairs walked in, carrying a shopping bag.

She saw the two of them standing by the stairs.

"Professor Laurent, Sophia, why are you just standing here?"

Auntie Zoe rubbed her red, chilled hands.

"This weather is freezing... I wouldn't have gone out if the supermarket wasn't having a sale."

Alexander's words were cut off.

He pressed his lips together.

Sophia stepped forward and took the shopping bag.

"Let me help you with that."

Alexander naturally took it from her.

He walked ahead.

Auntie Zoe smiled.

"Alex is so considerate. That's what you call a true gentleman, right?"

She looked at Sophia.

Sophia gave a slight nod.

"Yes."

"Such a fine young man, and still single. Professor Wang and I tried to set him up before. He always agreed readily, but whenever an actual meeting was arranged, he'd vanish."

Auntie Zoe lowered her voice.

"Sophia, if you know any suitable girls, remember to keep Professor Laurent in mind."

Sophia's eyes curved into a smile.

She glanced at Alexander's stiff back.

"Of course, I'll definitely keep an eye out for the Professor."

"That's more like it. Neighbors should help each other out..."

They reached the sixth floor.

Alexander set down the shopping bag.

He took Sophia's hand and quickly led her upstairs.

Auntie Zoe, fumbling for her keys, paused.

She blinked.

Did they just... hold hands?

Seventh-floor hallway.

Alexander released her hand.

His Adam's apple bobbed.

"Don't listen to Auntie Zoe's nonsense. I... I never went."

Sophia looked up.

"Went where?"

Alexander gritted his teeth.

"Professor, cat got your tongue?"

"...The blind dates."

Sophia nodded.

"Don't worry, I'll help you look out for opportunities."

She turned and unlocked her door, going inside.

Alexander stood frozen in place.

That wasn't what he meant...

...

The door closed.

Sophia let out a long breath.

She had said it on purpose.

In that moment, she was afraid Alexander would continue.

She was both curious and scared.

Afraid to hear the answer she suspected.

Even more afraid it wouldn't be that answer.

...

The auto repair shop called.

Sebastian Evans's voice came through the receiver.

"Your car is fixed. I'm downstairs at your place. I'll take you to pick it up."

"Isn't Mr. Evans busy at year-end?"

"Busy, but I always have time to see you."

Sophia chuckled lightly.

"I can just take a cab."

"Who was it that said they'd treat me to a meal? Already forgot?"

Sophia sighed.

"...Have you decided what you want to eat?"

Sebastian gave a low laugh.

"We'll talk about it when we meet."

Sophia hung up.

She put on her down jacket and snow boots, grabbed her bag, and headed out.

A Maybach was parked at the end of the lane.

Sebastian leaned against the car, playing with his keys.

He straightened up immediately upon seeing her.

Sophia walked over with a smile.

Sebastian handed her a bag of breakfast.

"Soy milk and buns. Eat them while they're hot."

Sophia raised an eyebrow.

"Mr. Evans personally playing chauffeur and buying breakfast? I wouldn't dare dream of such treatment."

He chuckled softly.

"Why not? You can dream even bigger."

Sophia cradled the soy milk for warmth.

"Why aren't you eating?"

"...It's hot."

Sebastian cleared his throat lightly.

"The repair shop said the front-end damage wasn't severe. It's been restored to like new."

Twenty minutes later.

They arrived at the auto repair shop.

Sophia completed the paperwork.

She looked at Sebastian.

"Decided what you want to eat?"

Sebastian curved his lips into a smile.

"Such cold weather is perfect for hot pot."

Sophia's eyes lit up.

A long line stretched outside the hot pot restaurant.

It was all young people.

Sophia hesitated.

"Should we go somewhere else?"

How long would they have to wait?

But Sebastian led her straight inside.

A server greeted them with a smile.

They were directly shown to a private room.

Sophia was surprised.

"You reserved a spot?"

Sebastian shook his head.

"No."

"Then how..."

"A classmate of mine owns this place."

Sophia understood.

The server handed them menus.

They finished ordering.

Sebastian added a few more items Sophia liked.

The spicy broth began to boil.

They were busy adding ingredients, with no time to talk.

Sophia took a bite.

The flavor was indeed authentic.

Sebastian served her more food.

"Eat more."

"I can help myself."

The owner pushed the door open.

He had a portly build and a warm, honest smile.

He and Sebastian exchanged pleasantries.

They reminisced about fun times from university.

Sophia ate while listening.

"...When I opened this place, I said any girlfriends you bring get free meals. You always came alone before. I thought I'd never see you use that privilege. Finally making me proud today!"

Sebastian chuckled softly without replying.
###Chapter 376

Sophia coughed lightly, caught off guard.

She had been listening intently when the topic suddenly shifted to her.

She was a bit flustered.

"We're not dating, but this meal is indeed complimentary for Mr. Evans." Sophia smiled at the owner. "I'll pay."

The owner was stunned for a moment, then shot Sebastian a meaningful look: Serves you right!

After the meal, Sophia walked toward the cashier.

The owner pulled Sebastian aside, lowering his voice. "You're slacking, man. Step up your game and win her over. No more free meals next time, or I'll never let you live it down!"

Sebastian sighed softly. "You think I don't want to?"

"Well, well. Finally found someone who can keep you in check. Rare sight."

"..."

"Hold on. Let your old buddy help you out."

Sebastian: "?"

Sophia had already reached the front desk, phone in hand, ready to pay.

After settling the bill, she turned to Sebastian, who was lagging behind. "Shall we go?"

"Wait a moment!" The owner cut in, smiling as he strode to the counter and signaled an employee.

"...What?" The cashier looked confused.

"The tickets."

"Oh! Right!"

The owner took them and shoved them into Sebastian's hand. "My sister got two piano concert tickets. A tone-deaf guy like me wouldn't appreciate it. Total waste! Ha... Since you're both here, take them!"

Sebastian glanced at the tickets and raised an eyebrow. "These are hard to get. Sure about this?"

"Just take them!"

"Alright. I won't stand on ceremony then."

They left the hot pot restaurant under the owner's watchful gaze.

Sebastian waved the tickets. "Maksim's piano concert. Interested?"

"Maksim? Seriously?" Sophia was surprised. "His tickets are impossible to get."

"See for yourself..."

Sophia looked down. They were genuine!

"Kind gesture, but the show starts in two hours. Waste not to go."

Sophia looked up. "Well... shall we go?"

"Great! Let's head out now!"

They drove separately, meeting at the Kyoto Concert Hall.

They entered through the VIP entrance and found their seats.

At 4 PM, the concert began.

The audience erupted in applause as Maksim bowed on stage.

Sophia sat in the front center, facing the stage with a perfect view. She clapped along, murmuring something.

It was too noisy. Sebastian leaned closer. "What did you say?"

Sophia turned, still clapping. "I said—"

Sebastian moved in.

"He's so charismatic."

The man raised an eyebrow. "Such as?"

"Handsome, and plays brilliantly!"

Handsome?

Sebastian smirked.

He could play too!

The opening was a modernized version of "Flight of the Bumblebee," fresh and innovative.

By the end, Sophia's palms were red from clapping.

The following "Grieg's Piano Variations," "Claudine," and "Cuba! Cuba!" were even more spectacular.

Sophia was completely absorbed in the music.

Sebastian, however, was distracted.

He kept glancing at her, his attention entirely on Sophia.

He barely registered the musical variations.

The dim lighting provided perfect cover, allowing his gaze to soften with affection.

His eyes repeatedly fell on Sophia's fair hands. He fought the urge to hold them, to never let go.

But reason prevailed.

He told himself: Be patient. Soon... just after tonight...

Don't rush. Don't scare her...

Two hours felt like an eternity for some, but for Sophia, it was a rare auditory feast.

Even after it ended, she was still savoring it.

"...Did you catch that 'Croatian Rhapsody'? He added rock elements! Unexpectedly romantic and vibrant, especially the middle variation. So surprising! What did you think?"

Sebastian was distracted. "...Hmm? Yes, quite good."

Lost in her own world, Sophia didn't notice his odd behavior.

Only when they exited the hall, under the streetlights and neon glow, did she realize it was dark.

Remembering her unfinished paper and unprepared lunch for tomorrow's lab, she prepared to say goodbye.

But before she could speak, Sebastian suddenly said, "Come with me somewhere?"

"...Hmm?"

"May I?" A startling brightness flashed in his dark, ink-like eyes.

Though puzzled, she agreed.

But...

"I need to be home by nine."

Sebastian said, "Okay."

...

Sophia followed Sebastian's car toward the suburbs.

They drove along a winding mountain road until they reached a hilltop.

"Sophia, look—"

They stopped at a windy overlook. Sophia was tightening her down jacket when Sebastian spoke.

She looked up, following his pointing finger.

A sea of city lights spread out below them, twinkling like a fallen galaxy.

"So beautiful..." Sophia whispered, mesmerized.

"Do you like it?" Sebastian's voice carried on the wind.

She nodded, amazed. "I never knew Kyoto had a place like this."

Suddenly, Sebastian pulled a bouquet from his car and walked toward her, smiling. "Sophia, happy birthday."

She froze.

She was used to celebrating her lunar calendar birthday. David and Isabella always did.

She hadn't even realized today was her solar calendar birthday.

"You... remember better than I do?" She couldn't help but laugh.

"For you." Sebastian handed her the flowers.

Only then did Sophia notice they were... blue roses!

"These..." She examined them curiously, her professional curiosity piqued. "Natural or dyed?"

It wasn't strange for her to ask. When it came to her field, her mind raced with investigative desire.

As far as she knew, natural blue roses didn't exist.

Market varieties like "Blue Enchantress" or "Blue Peter" were all artificially dyed.

But these...

She reached out and touched them, her expression serious, her gaze focused.

The bouquet was now in her hands.

Seeing this, Sebastian's eyes suddenly lit up.
###Chapter 377

The night breeze was cool.

Sebastian Evans offered the blue rose to Sophia Sullivan.

Its petals shimmered with an ethereal blue glow under the moonlight.

"Natural blue roses don't exist in nature," he said, his voice low. "They symbolize impossible hope."

Sophia accepted the bouquet.

The moment her fingertips brushed the petals, she paused.

"Is this... natural?" She looked up at Sebastian. "Not dyed?"

The corner of his mouth lifted slightly.

Her heart skipped a beat.

"How was this done?"

"A recent paper in ACS Synthetic Biology," Sebastian replied calmly. "The first author is Ankanahalli Nangavva from the T University School of Pharmacy."

He began explaining the genetic transformation process in detail.

But he stumbled at a key point.

Sophia couldn't help but laugh.

"Are you reciting the paper from memory?"

The tips of Sebastian's ears turned pink.

"It's not my field. Memorizing it verbatim was a bit challenging."

Sophia smoothly continued, "Agrobacterium is injected into white rose petals. Gene transfer is completed under acetosyringone induction, expressing the gene that synthesizes the blue enzyme."

Surprise flickered in Sebastian's eyes.

"You've read this paper?"

"The clues you provided were enough to deduce the outcome."

"Impressive," he praised sincerely.

"These must be very expensive?"

"For you, it's worth it."

Sophia thanked him softly and prepared to leave.

"Sophia." Sebastian stopped her.

His gaze was fixed intently on the blue rose.

"A flower that was once impossible now exists, right here in your hands." His voice was gentle. "That is a miracle."

Sophia's fingers trembled slightly.

"If a blue rose that doesn't exist in nature can be cultivated," he said slowly, "can feelings be cultivated too?"

Sophia's heart raced.

Sebastian took a deep breath.

His eyes were tender yet resolute.

"Nothing is absolute," he said, each word deliberate. "People who once vowed to grow old together part ways. Those who don't love now might find love in the future."

"Just like you used to dislike me, but now we can interact calmly." He took a step forward. "So in the future... could we go a step further?"

Sophia averted her gaze.

Her mind was in turmoil.

What was he trying to do?

"Sophia, you understand, don't you?" Sebastian saw through her evasion.

Sophia opened her mouth to speak.

Before any words came out, the night sky suddenly lit up.

Brilliant fireworks exploded overhead.

Multicolored lights illuminated their figures.

Sparkling points of light fell like stardust.

Sophia met Sebastian's deeply affectionate eyes.

Her heartbeat spiraled out of control.

She wanted to flee.

Sebastian remembered the night he took her home.

Watching her walk away beside Alexander Laurent.

He couldn't wait any longer.

Six years had passed.

A year spent carefully maintaining a friendship.

He didn't want to wait anymore.

He had prepared for this confession for so long.

He wanted to stand rightfully by her side.

To hold her openly.

To kiss her.

He was certain he wanted her.

The fireworks ended.

The smell of gunpowder hung in the air.

Sebastian watched her intently.

"Sophia Sullivan, I lo—"

A phone ringtone cut sharply through the silence.

The atmosphere froze instantly.

Sebastian frowned and pulled out his phone.

His movements stilled when he saw "Grandma" on the screen.

She rarely called.

The last late-night call was when she had trouble breathing and collapsed.

He answered immediately.

"Sorry, I need to take this."

Sophia let out a breath of relief.

Her tense nerves relaxed.

She hoped this call would interrupt whatever was about to happen.

"Grandma, what's wrong?"

Sobs and ragged breathing came from the other end.

Sebastian's heart sank.

"What happened? Are you unwell? Is Grandpa there? Where's the caregiver?"

He was met with choked sobs.

The crying grew louder, escalating into wails.

"Sebastian... Sebastian..."

Sebastian was frantic with worry.

"Don't get upset! I'll call an ambulance right now!"

"No... it's not that..." the old woman repeated. "Found... we really found her this time... Heaven has shown mercy..."

Sebastian was confused.

"Found what?"

"Florence, let me talk." Isaac Atlante's voice came through.

The old man's voice trembled, barely containing his excitement.

Sebastian felt slightly relieved.

His grandfather's presence meant his grandmother was physically okay.

But what could cause such a loss of composure?

"Sebastian."

"Grandpa, I'm listening."

Isaac struggled to steady his emotions.

"We found your aunt! Thirty years... a full thirty years... we finally found her!"

Sebastian was stunned.

Then, overwhelming joy surged through him.

"Really? Are you sure?"

"Yes! Your grandmother and I are both certain it's her! She's in the neighboring city right now!"
###Chapter 378

Yes, He Likes Sophia Sullivan

Linshi?

Sebastian Evans was momentarily stunned.

His gaze flickered towards Sophia Sullivan.
He quickly spoke into the phone. "Grandpa, I have an urgent matter to handle. I'll be back later. Please and Grandma, try to stay calm. The doctor said you must avoid extreme emotional swings."

"Alright, you handle your business. We found her anyway. And you actually know her."

Sebastian: "I know her?"

"Yes! Your aunt, she goes by Isabella Sullivan now. She's the author of 'Seven Days'! Remember that time at Kinokuniya Books? She was having a book signing upstairs, and we were right downstairs. It's all my fault. Your grandmother wanted to go up, but I said no. We missed her just like that..."

"And Sophia... no wonder I felt such an immediate fondness for that child. It was blood calling... Heaven had it planned all along. We found her in the end..."

"A-Seb? A-Seb? Are you listening?"

The old man kept talking, but Sebastian only heard a dull ringing in his ears.

He didn't catch another word after that. Only one sentence echoed relentlessly in his mind: "Your aunt is the author of 'Seven Days'."

Sophia's mother was his long-lost aunt?

He looked up at the sky, his expression completely blank.

Until—

"Sebastian, are you okay?" Sophia's puzzled voice reached him.

The call had ended long ago, but he still held the phone to his ear, frozen, his expression dazed, like a lost child.

"...Sebastian? What's wrong?"

Sophia didn't know what was said on the call, but his sudden pallor made her heart clench.

Sebastian slowly raised his head.

Helplessness, shock, self-mockery... a tumult of emotions swirled in his eyes.

Sophia had never seen Sebastian like this.

"What happened?" she asked again, her gaze worried.

He mechanically raised a hand, giving a weak wave, as if all his strength had been drained. His face was terrifyingly pale. "...It's nothing..."

"Sophia... I have to go..."

"Sorry... I can't drive you back... I'm sorry..."

She watched him get into his car, utterly distraught.
He mistakenly put the car into reverse instead of drive, fumbling to correct it.

He drove off without even turning on the headlights.

Sophia: "?"

What was that about?

But inwardly, she breathed a secret sigh of relief.

She had always been aware of Sebastian's feelings. He never hid them.

Before, he'd said things like "let's be together" or "be my girlfriend" half-jokingly. Each time, she had deflected with a joke of her own.

But today was different.

The city lights, the blue roses, the fireworks display – everything showed Sebastian's serious intent.

This wasn't a joke anymore.

If he had formally confessed, she would have had to formally reject him.

Though her answer was clear, rejecting someone who had helped her so many times would inevitably hurt him. Sophia felt the pressure.

Fortunately...

He didn't say it.

She didn't want to lose this friend.

She gathered the spent fireworks, disposed of the trash, and prepared to leave.

The bouquet of blue roses was truly rare.

Taking them home to put in a vase would be nice.

She placed the flowers on the back seat and drove away.

At 8:30 PM, Sophia parked her car.
She carried the flowers towards her apartment building.

It wasn't too late yet. The stalls along the alley were still open.
She bought two baked sweet potatoes.

The potatoes were scalding hot.
Holding the flowers, she carefully peeled one and took small bites.

After just a couple of bites, she glanced up and saw the man standing in front of her building.

Alexander Laurent insisted on night runs, often exercising even in the cold.

But today... he wasn't wearing workout clothes?

He wore a tailored overcoat, his expression slightly serious, as if waiting specifically for her?

"Professor." Sophia approached with a smile.

Alexander's eyes held a smile, but it froze the moment his gaze landed on the blue roses in her arms.

"Did you go out?"

"Not really for fun. I picked up my repaired car from the dealership first, then went to a piano recital."

"These flowers... are quite special."

Sophia's eyes lit up. "Professor, look closely. Do you see what's special about them?"

She offered the bouquet for him to inspect.

He looked down, studying them for a moment, then reached out to gently touch a petal. "...Naturally cultivated?"

As expected of a former biology expert, he saw the essence at a glance.

"Mhmm!"

"Where did you get them?" he asked.

Sophia hesitated for a second, then told the truth. "Sebastian gave them to me."

Alexander's eyes darkened. "Why did he suddenly give you flowers?"

"It's my solar calendar birthday today..."

"He celebrated your birthday?" He paused, remembering something. "And you went to the piano recital together?"

"...Mhmm."

The man's thin lips pressed into a tight, controlled line.
His hand, hanging by his side, slowly clenched.

Sophia handed him a peeled sweet potato, its honey-orange flesh steaming. "Would you like some, Professor?"

"...Yes, thank you." He reached out and took it.

"Let me hold the flowers, it's awkward for you..." Sophia had finished her own potato and reached for the bouquet to free his hands.

"It's fine, I'll hold them. You even peeled the sweet potato for me."

He said this, holding the flowers in one hand and eating the sweet potato with the other.

As they walked upstairs, Alexander suddenly spoke—

"Sophia, we've known each other for over a year now, right? I remember when you first moved in, just getting over your previous relationship. You were so downcast."

Thinking of her past self, Sophia also felt a wave of emotion. "Yeah. Even though I'd decided to break up, and knew it was the best choice, the withdrawal was unexpectedly tough."

"Fortunately, it's all in the past. I remember you saying time is the best healer. No need for self-pity or anxiety. Just leave everything to time, and the wounds will eventually heal."

Alexander: "And have you moved on now?"

"What?" Sophia was startled, turning to look at him.

Alexander repeated, "Have you moved on from that previous relationship?"

"Of course!"

The past was like the wind. Unconsciously, she had long since let it go.

"Then..." The man paused for a beat. "...have you considered starting a new relationship?"

As he asked this, Alexander's heart was tight.

This wasn't a casual question.

A few days ago, for Sophia's lunar calendar birthday, he took her to the factory workshop.
Seeing that jar of crushed diamonds, she asked him why he gave her the necklace.

In that moment, his mind went blank, and he blurted out it was for her birthday.

Later, on the way home, he thought it over and felt his answer was too careless.

So he wanted to answer again, and take this chance to express his feelings.

Yes, he liked Sophia Sullivan.

He liked her very, very much...

So much that his heart raced at the sight of her, and her voice filled him with joy.

So much that even in his dreams, he was unrestrained and knew no moderation...
###Chapter 379

Alexander Laurent never lied to himself.

After a brief period of avoidance, he chose to face his own heart.

That voice grew clearer and clearer—

You like her.

You are infatuated with her!

From initial restraint, to later acknowledgment, and finally to complete acceptance, he finally understood that emotions never obey the commands of reason.

Those suppressed desires had not disappeared.

Instead, they had grown wildly.

Each erotic dream felt like a slap to his face.

So shameful.

Yet so incredibly beautiful.

In his dreams, she was part fairy, part siren, effortlessly captivating his soul and holding it in her palm.

He was utterly powerless to resist.

Apart from complete surrender, he had no other choice.

Alexander Laurent was always decisive.

Only when it came to confessing his feelings to her did he hesitate.

Sophia Sullivan had just emerged from a failed relationship.

She was now fully immersed in her academic research.

She might not be willing to enter a new romance.

What if she refused?

How would they interact afterwards?

Pretend it never happened? Obviously impossible.

The only outcome would be a gradual drifting apart.

This was also the reason Alexander had delayed taking action.

But after their conversation was interrupted by the neighbor that night, Alexander suddenly felt he should be braver.

What if she was willing?

What if she felt the same way?

So tonight, he left the lab early.

He went home, showered, changed clothes, and waited for her downstairs.

He not only waited for her but also witnessed the blue roses sent by Sebastian Evans.

Sophia lowered her gaze and thought for a long time.

So long that they had climbed all seven flights of stairs and were now standing at their respective doors.

Alexander said, "I'm sorry, that was presumptuous of me. If you don't want to answer…"

"No," she looked up with a smile, "It's not that I don't want to answer. I just haven't figured out how to say it."

The man straightened up, his gaze focused.

She spoke slowly, "I once thought I had found true love. 'Easier to find a priceless treasure than a devoted lover.' Beautiful, isn't it?"

"My dad says when I'm stubborn, I'm like a mule that can't be pulled back. My mom calls it steadfastness. But I know it's a kind of faith. A firm choice made after consideration."

Before meeting Ethan Roscente, her faith was knowledge, academia, scientific research.

After meeting Ethan Roscente, he became her firm choice.

Even though she detested Ethan Roscente now, she had to admit they had shared happy times.

They had also treated each other sincerely, seeing each other as their one and only.

It was just a pity that circumstances change easily, and so do people's hearts.

Those six years seemed like a waste of youth.

But who's to say they didn't temper her resolve?

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

Sophia continued, "In the past, I thought liking someone meant devotion regardless of cost and giving without expecting anything in return. Later, I understood—"

A smile spread in her eyes, like sunlight breaking through clouds, "To love others, you must first love yourself. If you are no longer yourself, what right do you have to love anyone else?"

"For me now, love is not a necessity. I wasted six years. Now that I've finally picked up my studies again, I don't want to disappoint my professor, nor do I want my efforts to be wasted halfway. So, the way things are now is just fine…"

Whether it was Sebastian Evans or Alexander Laurent, she was clear about the former's intentions and could sense the latter's好感.

But—

So what?

Feelings are not a pastime, nor a game.

Once you enter, it demands your whole heart.

But she still had so many projects to complete, so many experiments unfinished.

The ocean of 'Science,' the peak of 'Nature'—she had only just pushed open a crack in the door of academia.

She had barely taken her first step into the vast world of research.

So many unfinished tasks awaited her.

Where would she find the energy for romance?

After listening, Alexander's heart sank slightly.

But he also felt it was expected.

If she easily stepped into the game, then she wouldn't be Sophia Sullivan.

"I understand." He suddenly felt relieved, a slow smile spreading across his features.

Sophia also smiled. "Professor, was the roasted sweet potato sweet?"

Alexander nodded. "Sweet."

"Then I'll treat you to one next time."

"Okay."

They said goodbye at their doors and went into their respective apartments.

Sophia immediately unwrapped the blue roses and divided them into two vases.

Paired with white baby's breath, the blue and white combination was strikingly beautiful.

She placed one vase on the coffee table.

Then, carrying the other vase, she knocked on Alexander's door. "Professor, these are for you. They should look nice on the media console."

Alexander looked down.

Blue roses paired with baby's breath resembled a clear blue sky with white clouds, purely and dazzlingly beautiful.

For a moment, he didn't know whether to be stunned or to laugh.

Stunned that she actually gave half the flowers to him.

Amused by Sebastian's elaborate efforts, which she regarded as utterly ordinary.

Just like his earlier confession, which she had gently deflected with effortless grace.

He had no chance, but it seemed Sebastian wasn't receiving any special treatment either?

"Professor, why are the lights off? It's pitch black inside?" Sophia glanced past him into the completely dark living room, the curtains drawn tightly shut.

Alexander's eyes flickered. "I went straight to the bedroom after coming in, so I didn't turn on the living room light."

"I see…" Sophia didn't think much of it. "Then get some rest early. I'm heading back."

"Okay."

Alexander watched her turn and go home before closing his door.

He looked down at the flowers in his hand, smiled wryly, and walked over to the media console in the darkness.

He bent down and placed the vase.

Then, with a soft click—

He turned on the living room light.

The previously dark apartment was instantly illuminated.

The usually clean floor was now covered in rose petals.

Within the petals, candles were arranged in the shape of a heart.

He smiled self-deprecatingly.

After who knows how long, Alexander got up from the couch.

He took out a lighter and lit those candles.

Clusters of candle flames flickered to life.

He simply turned off the lights again.

The warm, hazy glow cast the entire space in a soft, amber light.

The vase on the media console, with its blue roses and baby's breath, looked even more beautiful under the candlelight, complementing each other perfectly.

Alexander felt a sense of loss, but not sadness.

She had loved Ethan Roscente once.

Now, she loved academia and research.

And in the future?

Anything was possible.

That night, Sophia had a good dream.

Alexander also gradually let his mind go blank in the warm candlelight, his thoughts drifting far away.

Only after the candles had burned out did he clean up the rose petals scattered across the floor.

Then he returned to his bedroom and slowly sank into sleep.

And in his dreams, she was there.
###Chapter 380

Seven in the morning.

The phone's ringtone shattered the silence.

Sophia Sullivan groped for her phone, her eyes still heavy with sleep.

The sky outside was hazy.

She checked the time. It was only six forty.

"Dad?" Her voice was hoarse from sleep. "Calling so early?"

David Sullivan was silent for a few seconds.

His tone was flustered. "Clara... Your grandparents are here."

Sophia didn't process it immediately. "What grandparents?"

"Your mother's biological parents."

She sat up abruptly.

All sleepiness vanished.

Half an hour later, she booked the earliest flight.

Noon, twelve o'clock.

The plane landed on time.

The taxi headed towards the villa district.

She spotted two cars parked far in front of her house from a distance.

A black Bentley.

And a Hongqi L5.

Its special license plate numbers were particularly eye-catching.

Neighbors passing by all turned to look.

A Bentley could still be bought with money.

But that Hongqi L5 was something else entirely.

Sophia pressed her lips together.

A sinking feeling settled in her heart.

She walked into the courtyard.

David was squatting in the garden, digging up soil.

The shovel was turning the earth haphazardly.

Several empty flowerpots lay scattered at his feet.

He was clearly distracted.

The front door was wide open.

Faint voices could be heard from inside.

Sophia walked over and squatted in front of her father.

"Dad."

David looked up.

His eyes lit up the moment he saw his daughter.

"Clara! You're back!"

"Is Mom inside?"

"Yeah."

Sophia glanced at the shovel in his hand. "These potted plants were just repotted last week."

"...There are still a few left to do." His tone was guilty.

Sophia took the shovel.

Her voice was soft. "Aren't you happy that Mom found her family?"

David shook his head hurriedly. "It's not that I'm not happy..."

"Then why are you hiding out here?"

His expression was conflicted. "Your grandparents seem... very distinguished."

"So?"

"Will they be dissatisfied with me? Will they take your mother away? Will your mother not want us anymore?"

Sophia finally understood his worry.

She comforted him gently. "You know what kind of person Mom is better than anyone."

Isabella Sullivan had long given up on searching for her relatives.

Finding her family unexpectedly now was supposed to be a happy occasion.

David took a deep breath. "You're right... I'm overthinking it."

"Let's go in together."

"Okay."

Father and daughter walked side by side towards the living room.

Sophia's steps faltered slightly when she saw the figures on the sofa.

Sebastian Evans was sitting upright.

His expression was more serious than she had ever seen it.

Two elderly people sat beside him.

Sophia recognized them immediately.

The kind elderly couple she had met a few times in Kyoto.

Sebastian's grandparents.

They were now in her own home.

Sebastian looked up at her.

His gaze was complex, as if he wanted to say something but stopped himself.

Isabella's eyes were red, but she was smiling.

She waved at the father and daughter.

"Mom, Dad, this is David and Sophia."

Sophia quickly collected herself.

She greeted them obediently. "Grandpa, Grandma."

David's voice was stiff with nervousness. "Hello... I'm a physics teacher at Lin City No.1 High School..."

Fine beads of sweat appeared on his temples.

The elderly couple nodded faintly at their son-in-law.

But their eyes softened instantly when they turned to Sophia.

"So we've already met our granddaughter." Grandma murmured softly. "No wonder I felt such an affinity for you the first time we met."
###Chapter 381

Florence Atlante was immensely grateful she had listened to Sebastian's advice.

She had persisted with her eye treatment and physical therapy.

Her vision was gradually improving.

Now she could finally see her granddaughter's face clearly.

It was the spitting image of her daughter in her youth.

Isabella was astonished to learn her parents had already met her daughter.

Sophia softly recounted their first meeting.

Isaac couldn't help but sigh.

"We've been searching for you all these years."

"We've looked everywhere, both domestically and abroad."

"Never imagined we were so close by."

"And we missed each other twice."

"Thank goodness we didn't miss you this time."

Florence Atlante recalled Sophia and Sebastian had met even earlier.

It seemed fate had its own plans.

"Clara, Sebastian is actually your cousin."

"All these years, he never had a clue."

Sebastian had remained silent since earlier.

His face was tense, expression rigid.

Sophia paused for a moment, then quickly caught on.

She smiled and called out, "Brother."

Sebastian's fists suddenly clenched.

The emotions in his eyes were dark and unreadable.

Florence Atlante didn't notice, continuing to smile on her own.

"If only Sebastian had been a bit more observant."

"Perhaps we would have been reunited much sooner."

Isaac waved his hand dismissively.

"Don't say that."

"It's already wonderful that Sebastian and Clara have this connection."

"We shouldn't be too greedy."

"Yes, yes, this is good enough."

"Truly good enough."

Finding their daughter in their lifetime was already a tremendous blessing.

Florence Atlante didn't dare ask for more.

Sophia held her cup and smiled.

Sebastian kept his eyes downcast, remaining silent.

He was unusually quiet.

Not his usual composed self.

Isabella was also surprised by the connection between the two.

But she was more curious about their experiences over the years.

Her memories of her parents had mostly returned.

Ever since she hit her head during the argument with Nina Moore.

Fragments of memory kept surfacing.

Now, seeing Isaac and Florence Atlante in person.

Hearing them talk about her childhood.

The gaps in Isabella's memory were finally filled.

Except...

"How exactly did I go missing?"

"I still have no memory of how I ended up in the river."

She only remembered going shopping with her sister, Irene.

What happened after that?

She couldn't recall at all.

Mentioning this, Isabella thought of Irene.

"How is sister? Has she been well all these years?"

Isaac and Florence Atlante exchanged a glance and fell silent simultaneously.

Irene didn't know they had found Isabella.

They hadn't planned to bring her along.

Seeing their hesitation, Isabella was about to ask again.

Florence Atlante sighed.

"She's fine, everything is fine."

"She married Theodore."

Hearing that name again, Isabella felt a bit dazed.

The image of the spirited young man surfaced in her mind.

They had grown up together, once promising forever.

Now, over twenty years had passed.

He married her sister, and she married David.

Past affections had all turned to smoke.

Isabella felt happy for her sister.

"It's all in the past."

"No need to bring it up anymore."

"How have you been all these years?" The elderly couple only cared about their daughter's experiences.

Isabella smiled, only sharing the good parts.

She had drifted along the river to the neighboring city, where David Sullivan saved her.

She couldn't remember her past, only vaguely recalling the sound "Isabella Sullivan."

When David helped her register for household registration, he used the name "Isabella."

David had reported to the police at the time.

But investigative techniques were limited back then.

The internet wasn't widespread.

Eventually, the case was dropped.

She settled in the neighboring city.

David helped her adapt to her new life.

They developed feelings for each other during their time together.

Although her mother-in-law often made things difficult.

David always treated her very well.

They supported each other.

David took meticulous care of her.

At this point, she looked toward David.

He had been sitting quietly since the introductions.

Feeling Isabella's gaze, he had no time to wonder.

He watched as she walked toward him.

Gently linking her arm with his.

She formally introduced him to her parents again.

"Mom, Dad, David saved my life."

"He gave me a stable life."

"He is not only my savior."

"But also the love of my life."

"He is truly wonderful."

"And he has been so good to me all these years."

"Meeting him and giving birth to Sophia."

"Are the happiest things that have ever happened to me."

David was shocked and surprised.

A smile soon spread across his face.

He looked at Isabella with deep affection.

The elderly couple looked at their daughter's determined expression.

Finally, they gave David their full attention.

While the elders were talking.

Sophia got up to use the restroom.

When she came out, Sebastian was waiting for her.

His face held a deathly stillness.

Beneath the stillness lay a heartbreaking despair.

Sophia hadn't expected him to follow her.

She instinctively called him "Brother."

That word was like a key.

Instantly unleashing the madness and despair in his eyes.

His dark eyes locked onto her.

He spoke, word by word.

"To hell with brother."

"I never wanted to be your brother!"

He lifted his head.

Sophia was shocked by the emotions in his eyes.

There was attachment, despair.

And an obsession that wouldn't turn back until it hit a wall.

Sebastian stepped closer.

He backed Sophia into a corner.

"You know perfectly well how I feel about you..."
###Chapter 382

Sebastian’s gaze was intense.

Sophia raised her hand to stop him.

She looked directly into his eyes.

“Think carefully.”

“Think about what you really want to say.”

“What you should say.”

“Then speak.”

The man trapped her between the wall and his chest.

His hands braced on either side of her.

“You know, don’t you?”

Sophia averted her eyes.

“What if I do?”

“What if I don’t?”

“Our current relationship shouldn’t…”

Sebastian gave a wry smile.

“What is our relationship?”

“You tell me.”

“What am I to you?”

She was silent for a moment.

“…Cousins.”

He suddenly laughed.

“You probably don’t know yet.”

“My mother wasn’t actually born to my grandparents.”

“Which means—”

“We are not related by blood!”

Sophia was stunned.

Then she shook her head.

“Blood or not.”

“You and I are impossible.”

“Why?”

“I don’t like you.”

Those words again.

Always those words.

Sebastian gripped her shoulders.

He applied slight pressure.

“Why can’t you like me?”

“You even loved someone like Ethan Roscente.”

“Why can’t you like me?”

“Sophia…”

Tears welled in his eyes.

“Don’t be so cruel to me.”

“Okay?”

Composure.

Reason.

Sebastian threw it all away.

He just wanted to finish what he hadn’t said last night.

He wouldn’t give Sophia any chance to escape.

But—

“Enough.” The woman turned her head away.

Her eyes were calm and unreadable.

Sebastian suddenly felt a bitter taste in his mouth.

He spoke with difficulty.

“Why won’t you let me finish?”

“Why…”

“Won’t you give me even a single chance?”

“You’re afraid.”

“Aren’t you?”

“Afraid there might be another possibility between us.”

“No.” Sophia shook her head gently.

From beginning to end.

She remained so composed.

“I’m stopping you.”

“Because I think it’s unnecessary.”

“From now on.”

“No matter what you think.”

“We are only siblings.”

“And we can only be siblings!”

Having said that.

She stepped around the man.

And left the restroom.

Leaving Sebastian standing alone.

Motionless.

He didn’t know how much time had passed.

Finally, he curled his lips in self-mockery.

“Hah…”

Siblings?

Back then, he yearned for her to call him “Seb” but couldn’t get it.

Now she truly called him “brother.”

Yet it pierced his heart like a dagger!

…

That night.

Isaac and Florence Atlante stayed at the villa.

Isabella Sullivan stayed in their room chatting with them.

Until the early hours of the morning.

The elderly couple couldn’t get enough of their long-lost daughter.

They wished they could make up for the past twenty-plus years all at once.

Isabella knew.

Her parents had exhausted themselves searching for her all these years.

Their health had suffered.

Looking at their aged faces.

Remembering how the old lady’s eyes were damaged from crying…

Her heart ached with sorrow.

“It’s so late already without us realizing.”

“A-Min, you should go rest.”

Florence held her daughter’s hand.

Crow’s feet gathered at the corners of her eyes.

Isaac also smiled and said.

“Your mother and I aren’t going anywhere.”

“We finally found our daughter.”

“We won’t lose her again no matter what.”

Isabella nestled against her mother.

Just like when she was a child.

“Okay, you should get to sleep early too.”

“Tomorrow I’ll take you to see the places I’ve lived these years…”

“Goodnight, Mom and Dad.”

She closed the door.

And returned to the master bedroom.

David Sullivan was still awake.

He waited for her in his pajamas.

“Are the elderly folks asleep?”

“Yes.” Isabella nodded gently.

“Are they comfortable here?”

“Is the blanket thick enough?”

“I…”

Isabella pressed his hand.

“Stop fussing.”

“They’ll speak up if they need anything.”

David scratched his head.

He grinned sheepishly.

“Right, why would they be formal in their own daughter’s home?”

Isabella sat on the edge of the bed.

David looked at her red-rimmed eyes.

His heart ached for her.

But he said nothing.

He simply opened his arms and pulled Isabella into an embrace.

His large hand gently stroked her hair.

He couldn’t help but sigh softly—

“Tired from crying?”

“It’s alright now, you’ve finally found your birth parents.”

“From now on, my A-Min is also a child who is loved.”

At that moment.

The emotions Isabella had held back all day finally broke.

Tears fell like rain.

…

Elsewhere.

Sebastian declined Isabella’s kind offer.

He did not stay overnight.

Instead, he chose to check into a hotel.

He found a bar.

As soon as he sat down, he ordered several bottles of strong liquor.

He drank one glass after another.

During that time.

Several women came to hit on him.

But without exception, he sent them all away.

Sebastian drank until his face was flushed.

Only when his vision began to blur.

Did he return to the hotel.

Along the way.

His mind was hazy.

Every time he closed his eyes, he saw Sophia’s face.

He didn’t understand.

Why was he always one step too late?

In the past.

He lost to Ethan Roscente.

Now.

He lost to this damned “cousin” title.

Hah…

Heaven had never shown him any favor!

Getting out of the taxi.

Sebastian staggered into the hotel.

As he exited the elevator.

A sweet fragrance wafted into his nostrils.

Then a soft body pressed against him.

Her chest brushed against his arm intentionally or unintentionally.

A bold provocation.

Her voice was sickly sweet.

“Handsome, why are you alone?”

“You seem drunk.”

“Shall I go back to your room with you…”

Due to the alcohol.

Sebastian’s reactions were slower than usual.

But ultimately, he raised his hand and nearly threw the woman to the ground.

“Get lost!”

“Don’t touch me!”

His disgusted reaction was as if he had touched something filthy.

The woman was humiliated and angry.

She couldn’t help but pout.

She spat.

“How dare you push me?!”

“A drunk.”

“Probably got dumped by someone.”

“What’s so great about that?!”

Little did she know.

Her words struck right at Sebastian’s sore spot.

He sneered.

Lifting his chin slightly.

The coldness in his eyes seemed enough to freeze someone.

The woman shrank back.

In the end, she didn’t dare say more.

She turned and ran.

Sebastian lowered his brows.

He suddenly wanted to call Sophia.

But taking out his phone.

He realized it was already past one in the morning.

His thumb hesitated.

In the end, he didn’t press the call button.

Just then, two hotel staff passed by.

Seeing he was seriously drunk.

They stepped forward to ask if he needed help.

Sebastian took out his key card.

Gesturing for them to take him back to his room.

One staff member supported him.

The other used the key card to open the door.

They helped Sebastian lie down on the bed.

Then the two turned to leave.

“How much did he drink?”

“To be this drunk?”

“Even people staying in executive suites have worries.”

“Need to drown their sorrows?”

“How do you know he drank a lot?”

“Couldn’t you smell the strong alcohol on him?”

“We hadn’t even gotten him to the bed yet.”

“He was already passed out drunk.”

“Isn’t that a lot?”

“Hey, did you hear him muttering something just now?”

“Sounded like… ‘Nian Nian’?”

“Whatever, as long as he’s delivered safely.”

“We should still report it to the front desk later.”

“Keep an extra eye on this suite…”

…

The morning in the city was full of life.

There was a large market near the villa district.

Before eight o’clock.

Some early-rising elderly folks were already coming out of the market with full shopping bags.

Even in the villa area.

Many people were heading over in small groups, pulling their grocery carts.

“It’s all about the freshness!”

“Young people these days.”

“All they know is how to make money.”

“What do they know about picking vegetables or choosing meat?”

“Don’t they still rely on us mothers?”

“Going to the market is a tradition passed down by our ancestors.”

“Let those who love supermarkets go there.”

“I don’t like them anyway.”

“I love picking and choosing at the market.”

“Bargaining over a few cents!”

“Hehe, me too!”

“But my daughter and son-in-law don’t like it.”

“They always go to those imported supermarkets.”

“Expensive and not even tasty.”

“How can they compare to the fresh local produce at the market?”

Irene Valdemar had just gotten out of the car.

She looked at the villa district not far away, which had a decent environment.

But what reached her ears was a group of aunties sharing their grocery shopping tips.

She couldn’t help but frown.

A faint sense of disdain rose in her heart.

This city…

To put it nicely.

It was a “city.”

But how different was a prefecture-level city from a county town?

Both were small places.

What kind of golden phoenix could a small place produce?

Even a real phoenix that ended up here.

Would most likely be assimilated by the common chickens.
###Chapter 383
Irene Arrives.

Irene clutched the documents from the private investigator.

She had found Isabella's current address.

It was a villa in a neighboring city.

She stood outside the wrought iron gate.

She looked up at the building.

The community appeared ordinary from the outside.

But inside was a different world.

She never thought, after ending up in such a backwater place.

Isabella could still afford to live in a villa.

A cold smile curled Irene's lips.

Her younger sister.

Had always been impossibly lucky since childhood.

Even on a casual trip to a temple.

An old monk would approach her unsolicited, proclaiming her destiny was one of great fortune.

While Irene was always overlooked.

Wherever Isabella was present.

Irene became part of the background.

Irene walked through the meticulously maintained garden.

She reached the main door.

She pressed the doorbell.

David Sullivan answered the door.

He was in the middle of preparing dumplings for the elderly couple.

He had just finished kneading the dough.

When the doorbell rang.

He opened the door.

He saw a woman dressed in luxurious clothes.

She stood outside with a haughty expression.

"Who are you looking for?"

Irene scrutinized the man before her.

His height was acceptable.

His features were regular.

But his clothes were rustic.

Utterly lacking in taste.

"You are David Sullivan?" she asked, raising an eyebrow.

"Yes. Who are you looking for?"

Irene sneered inwardly.

Isabella actually married a man like this.

David felt her assessing gaze.

It was filled with obvious picky.

It made him very uncomfortable.

He was about to ask again.

Isabella's voice came from behind him—

"Sister?"

…

In the living room.

Irene sat on the sofa.

Isabella handed her a glass of warm water.

"I remember you don't like coffee or tea."

Before coming, Irene had imagined many possibilities.

Over twenty years of displacement.

Life should have worn away Isabella's radiance.

Perhaps she was alone.

Aged and haggard.

Perhaps she married just anyone.

Had children.

Her figure ruined.

Without the nourishment of money.

Her beauty faded.

But the Isabella before her.

Looked just like she remembered.

Not a single trace of life's hardships.

Still naive and stupid.

The way she looked at her was exactly the same as before.

Did that mean…

She still hadn't remembered those things?

The documents said Isabella had amnesia.

Ended up in the neighboring city.

Amnesia…

Irene took a deep breath.

Her anxious heart suddenly settled.

She asked with a smile, "How have you been all these years? Mom, Dad, and I searched for you like crazy."

Isabella smiled. "I've been well. You haven't changed at all, sister."

"I still remember the day you disappeared, the weather was beautiful, we were shopping together…"

Irene tentatively brought up the past.

Seeing Isabella's blank expression.

She was completely reassured.

"Mom and Dad thought you were kidnapped and taken abroad. They searched for decades overseas, only recently returning to the country. They just got news of you…"

Speaking emotionally.

Tears welled in her eyes.

Isabella felt a pang of sadness.

Yesterday, the elderly couple had spoken of the past.

But only glossed over the hardships lightly.

This was the first time she heard the details.

The extent of their efforts.

Was beyond calculation…

Irene saw her eyes moisten.

She changed the subject.

She talked about Isabella's favorite stamps and candy boxes.

"I still remember, when we went to Grandma's house, you always saved the prettiest candy for me. In comparison, I've been a failure as an older sister. Not only did I lose you, but I also found you so late."

Irene gave a bitter smile.

She looked full of self-reproach and sorrow.

Isabella had no memory of the disappearance.

But she couldn't remain indifferent to Irene's guilt.

"It's alright, sister. We're reunited now. It wasn't your fault…"

Being able to see her family again.

Was already the best outcome.

Just as Isabella was softly comforting her.

The elderly couple came downstairs.

Seeing Irene.

Florence was taken aback.

She instantly frowned—

"What are you doing here?"

Irene quickly stood up. "Dad. Mom."

The old gentleman didn't speak.

The old lady went straight to Isabella's side.

She shielded her daughter.

Isabella was puzzled. "Mom?"

Irene's eyes darkened.

But she quickly raised a smile again. "I heard you found my sister, so I rushed over from Kyoto. I didn't expect you to be living here…"

Isabella said, "Sister just told me many things about the past."

"Really? What did she say?" The old lady's face showed a smile.

Isabella said, "She talked about how we used to fight over candy at Grandma's house…"

The old lady listened.

Her heart felt warm.

Her eyes held a smile.

But out of the corner of her eye, she saw Irene with her eyes downcast.

Her expression was unreadable.

She couldn't help feeling uneasy again.

For some reason.

She always had misgivings about Irene.

It was an intuition.

And her intuition was never wrong.

But she had no evidence now.

She could only suppress it.
###Chapter 384

A family reunited is truly a cause for celebration.
The old man was filled with emotion.

David Sullivan quickly nodded in agreement.

Isabella Sullivan then remembered she hadn't introduced her husband to Irene Valdemar.
"This is my husband."

Irene smiled slightly. "Your husband is so refined and handsome."
The earlier scrutiny and judgment had completely vanished from her eyes.

David gave a slight nod. "Hello."
His politeness held a trace of imperceptible distance.

Others might not have noticed, but Isabella was acutely aware.
She shot him a questioning look.

David shook his head gently, his eyes signaling they would talk later.
This sister-in-law gave him a feeling...
A rather peculiar one.
Even a faint sense of discomfort.
He decided to maintain his distance.

"Dad, are we still making the dumplings—"
Sophia Sullivan emerged from the kitchen and froze upon seeing everyone in the living room.
Her gaze finally settled on Irene.

Isabella smiled and waved her over. "Clara, come here."
Sophia walked over slowly.
"Sis, this is my daughter, Sophia Sullivan. Clara, this is your aunt."

Their eyes met. Sophia called out obediently, "Aunt."

Irene appeared calm and smiling on the surface, but inside, her mind was reeling.
This girl—
Wasn't she the one standing next to Alexander Laurent outside the Mercedes-Benz dealership that day?
She had even taken a photo and sent it to Sylvia Laurent.
She had asked if Alexander was seeing someone, but the other woman had been evasive.
Thinking back now...
Perhaps the Laurent family wasn't satisfied with this girl?

A flicker of amusement passed through Irene's eyes, instantly replaced by warm delight.
"Ah Min, your daughter is absolutely stunning! Even more beautiful than you were in your youth. Look at her figure, her face..."
A stream of compliments poured out.
"...What does Clara do now?"

Isabella smiled. "She's still in graduate school."
"At a university in Kyoto?"
"Yes, at MIT."

Irene's eyebrows rose slightly in surprise.
MIT...
She has some capability.
"Our Clara is so outstanding," Irene said affectionately, taking Sophia's hand. "Do you have a boyfriend?"

Isabella couldn't answer for her daughter and looked at Sophia instead.
The old man and old woman also turned their attention to her.

"No."

A dark glint flashed in Irene's eyes. So, not acknowledged by the Laurents.
But to have caught Alexander Laurent's eye, she must have some skills!
"A good girl doesn't worry about marriage. Our Clara is so exceptional, there's no hurry..."

Sophia, her hand held by Irene, listened to the string of flattery and felt extremely uncomfortable.
"I'll go check if the dumplings are ready."
She found an excuse and hurried away.

Soon, steaming hot dumplings were served.
David invited everyone to eat.
He also set out bowls and chopsticks for Irene.

"No need, I ate before coming."
Isabella urged, "Have a little more?"
Irene waved her hand. "Really, no."

The old woman glanced at her but said nothing, walking directly to the table to look at the dumplings. "David, what fillings did you make?"

David replied, "There's cabbage and pork, mushroom and corn, chive and egg, and cilantro beef. I made a variety of each."
"Thoughtful." The old woman smiled and sat down.
She preferred vegetarian fillings, while Isaac Atlante loved meat ones. Having both was indeed considerate.

The old woman's feelings toward David were quite complex.
When she learned her daughter was married with a child, she held reservations about this unfamiliar son-in-law.
It wasn't dislike, just too sudden, filled with uncertainty.
After all, the daughter in her memory was still an innocent young girl, but upon reunion, she was already a wife and mother.
Fortunately...
So far, this son-in-law seemed quite satisfactory.
Refined, meticulous, considerate, with good looks and education.
Though just a high school teacher, not immensely wealthy, it was a respectable and stable profession.

"The chive and egg and mushroom corn ones are very fresh," the old woman praised after tasting them.
Isaac had already finished one bowl and was serving himself a second. "Try this cilantro beef, that's really flavorful..."

David, feeling a bit embarrassed by the praise, scratched his head sheepishly. "I'm glad you like them. I made plenty, we can cook more if it's not enough."
"Don't just stand there, sit down and eat. You've been busy all morning, you've worked hard..."
David responded by serving dumplings and sitting next to Isabella. "It's no trouble at all. It's my duty."

The family's joyful atmosphere made Irene seem like an outsider.
She was out of place in this warm scene.
She subconsciously pressed her lips together, forcing a smile. "Mom, Dad, I made a reservation at a restaurant. Let's go out for lunch? To celebrate the reunion."

The old man frowned upon hearing this.
Restaurant food was too oily and salty, Florence Atlante's body couldn't handle it.
Isabella thought of this too. "Going out is too troublesome. Why not eat at home? Let David cook, he's quite good."
David quickly nodded. "I'll go to the market today and buy groceries. We'll eat at home."

The old woman beamed but said, "Won't it be too much trouble?"
"No trouble at all!"
Isaac, chewing on a beef dumpling, laughed. "Alright, we'll taste David's cooking at noon."
No one asked for Irene's opinion. The matter was settled.

After breakfast was cleared, David got ready to go out with his shopping cart.
Sophia put on her shoes and grabbed her jacket. "Dad, I'll go with you."
"Okay."

The market was full of David's acquaintances—
"Mr. Sullivan, you're later than usual today."
David nodded. "We have guests at home."
"Mr. Sullivan, the fish is very fresh today. Want one?"
"Need some beef? I'll give you a discount if you take the whole piece."

Someone recognized Sophia. "Is this your daughter? So pretty! Does she have a boyfriend? I have a nephew back home..."
"Come on, Mr. Sullivan's daughter is a graduate student at MIT! Is your nephew a match? Wishful thinking."
Others noticed the luxury car parked outside and guessed the guests must be wealthy or important.

David listened as the speculation grew wilder, patiently explaining, "My parents-in-law are here."
The fish vendor teased, "No wonder you're shopping so early. Trying to make a good impression on the in-laws, eh?"
David smiled without confirming or denying.

Sophia assisted her father the entire time, carrying bags, loading the cart, and handling payments, thoroughly enjoying herself.

Returning from the market, David immediately headed into the kitchen.
Soon, the aroma of stewed meat filled the air.

Isabella checked the time. "Should we call Sebastian? Ask him to come for dinner."
The old woman nodded. "He's probably still handling work at the hotel. Let him know first."
Isabella took out her phone only to realize she didn't have Sebastian Evans's number.

"Clara, call your brother and tell him to come for lunch."
Sophia was stunned for a moment before realizing Isabella meant for her to contact Sebastian Evans.
"Your brother"...
It was such an unfamiliar term.
But she would get used to it eventually.
She would.
And so would Sebastian.
Isabella asked Sophia Sullivan to contact Sebastian Evans.
###Chapter 385

They had known each other for a while.

Back at the train station, David Sullivan's wallet was stolen. Sebastian was the one who helped.

Sophia introduced him then, saying Mr. Evans was her friend.

Later, Sebastian kindly drove them all the way home.

Isabella had a very good impression of him.

Yesterday, when she learned his identity, she privately marveled at how fate works.

Sophia nodded. "Okay."

...

Sebastian slept until nine.

The hangover left his head throbbing.

He had quit smoking and drinking for over half a year and rarely indulged like this.

After showering, he ordered breakfast.

He started working right after eating.

Two hours flew by.

He was about to get up and stretch when his phone rang.

The name "Sophia Sullivan" on the screen made his heart race.

He answered immediately—

"Soph—"

"Bro, come over for lunch."

The word "Bro" made him pause.

After a moment, Sebastian replied softly, "...Okay."

"Dinner's at noon."

"Mm."

...

Sophia hung up and went to help in the kitchen.

David was the main cook, and she assisted.

Isabella followed the delicious smell.

Her eyes lit up seeing her favorite fish.

"It smells amazing... You didn't use soy sauce, right?"

David smiled. "Made it just how you like it. Go sit, it's almost ready."

Isabella checked that she wasn't needed before returning to the living room to chat with the elders.

Irene Valdemar sat nearby, occasionally joining the conversation.

But the elders' attention was fully on Isabella.

Irene fell silent, her nails digging into her palms.

At exactly noon, Sebastian arrived.

"Sebastian's here—" Isabella stood to greet him.

The old lady smiled.

Sebastian entered and greeted them first. "Grandma, Auntie..."

Then he noticed Irene on the sofa.

He paused, speaking softly. "Mom."

"Hm." Irene's tone was cold.

Sebastian frowned but said nothing more.

The food was soon served, covering the table.

There were dishes Isabella and Sophia loved, and ones the elders preferred.

Considering Florence Atlante's health, the food was light and low in oil.

But it was still colorful and aromatic, making mouths water.

"Didn't have much time, just whipped something up." David took off his apron.

Isabella saw his sweaty forehead and心疼ly handed him a bowl for soup.

Irene watched, feeling an inexplicable envy.

Theodore Valdemar never cooked. He didn't even know her preferences.

Nothing like David...

Irene snapped out of it, finding herself ridiculous.

How could David, a mere teacher, compare to Theodore?

What capable man enters the kitchen?

"Sis, try the ribs. David's specialty."

Irene smiled and nodded. "Delicious. Your husband is quite the cook."

Isabella smiled happily. "He couldn't cook when we first married. I didn't want to learn, so he did. He's been doing it for decades."

Irene's smile was strained. "Your husband is very... domestic..."

The doorbell suddenly rang.

Sebastian put down his chopsticks. "I'll get it."

He walked to the foyer.

A few seconds later, his surprised voice echoed—

"Dad? What are you doing here?"

Isabella's hand, holding chopsticks, froze.

David was stunned, his mind racing: Sebastian's father... that's Irene's husband...

The elders exchanged a look, worry and confusion in their eyes.

Why did Theodore come so suddenly?

They hadn't told him...

Did Sebastian mention it?

Only Irene stiffened at the sound, then smiled mockingly.

So fast...

Sebastian led Theodore inside.

The man wore a sharp suit under a gray overcoat.

It was raining outside; his shoulders were slightly damp.

The moment he entered, his eyes locked onto Isabella.

He couldn't look away.

The woman he had thought of, yearned for, for decades.

"Honey, you're here." Irene stood and took his arm. "Faster than I thought. Look, it's Emilia. We found her. Happy?"

Theodore didn't speak. He pulled his arm away.

Irene froze, her smile widening—

"Emilia, remember? This is Theodore! You always called him 'big brother' when we were young. He's been searching for you all over the world all these years. Now that we've found you, isn't he a devoted brother-in-law?"

Irene was the one who called Theodore.

Maybe to show off, maybe for revenge, maybe to make him see the ordinary person Emilia had become.

The moment she got the news, she notified Theodore.

Theodore wanted to come himself, urgently.

His long-lost white moonlight was here.

He was supposed to return to Kyoto from S City, but he drove through the night instead.

Irene knew he drove all night from S City.

Hah, so eager to see her?

Driving at night...

Even someone as calm as him could act crazy!

Irene clenched her fists, her heart aching, but she forced a smile.

Theodore didn't even notice her.

His eyes were only for Isabella.

She hadn't changed. Serene, gentle, beautiful, pure, like a faintly fragrant lily.

"Honey, why so quiet? Mom and Dad are here." Irene gritted her teeth to remind him.

Theodore snapped back to reality. He greeted the elders first, then looked at Isabella.

"Long time no see..."

His eyes held complex, hard-to-read emotions.

Isabella smiled, just like yesterday. "Theodore."
###Chapter 386

Memories instantly pulled him back twenty years.

Two young teenagers, their eyes only for each other.

That thin, unspoken barrier between them had never been breached.

Theodore's heart stirred slightly, and he was just about to speak.

But Emilia suddenly stood up.

Her smile was gentle. "Look at me... I should call you brother-in-law now."

She turned to the man beside her. "Let me introduce you. This is my husband, David Sullivan."

'Brother-in-law.'

'My husband.'

Theodore's breath hitched.

His gaze fell on the man next to Emilia.

David, completely unaware, warmly invited Theodore to sit.

He even fetched a clean bowl and chopsticks for him.

Theodore's lips moved.

Finally, only two words came out. "...Thank you."

David's cooking skills were exceptional to begin with.

Today, he had put in extra effort.

The dishes were, naturally, impeccable.

The elderly couple praised them endlessly.

Throughout the meal, David attentively looked after Emilia and Sophia.

He peeled shrimp for his wife and served food to his daughter.

Sophia looked at the small mountain in her bowl and said helplessly, "Dad, I haven't finished what I already have."

Emilia chuckled lightly. "Stop serving me too. If I can't finish, you'll have to clean my plate, you know?"

"No problem," David replied cheerfully.

It was usual for him to finish whatever Emilia couldn't eat.

David was completely accustomed to it.

But to others, these words carried a different meaning—

Theodore's eyes darkened.

Irene curled her lips in a mocking smile.

Trying to act all loving?

Sebastian focused on his meal, as if in a vacuum, indifferent to everything around him.

The old man and woman exchanged a glance.

They had previously worried David wasn't good enough for their daughter.

Now, they were concerned this simple son-in-law might be taken advantage of.

After all—

Everyone present could see Emilia had David wrapped around her finger.

And he seemed utterly delighted, completely content with the arrangement.

It was truly...

A perfect match.

David, considering the old  woman's poor teeth and preference for light flavors, specially served her a bowl of tofu and three-delicacy soup.

"It's just the right temperature now, and the meat is stewed until tender, Mom. You can eat without worry."

"Ah! Thank you, I can serve myself…"

Despite her words, David personally placed the soup bowl in front of the old  woman.

"Don't just drink the soup, have some dishes too…"

"Alright."

Isaac preferred stronger flavors, but his health indicators were a bit high.

David prepared some light, refreshing side dishes for him, paired with low-sugar braised pork.

The elderly couple exchanged a smile, their eyes filled with relief.

At this moment, they finally believed their daughter had been living well all these years.

Theodore kept watching Emilia out of the corner of his eye.

He saw her serving the old  woman, whispering to David, occasionally checking on their daughter…

She also smiled and urged him and Irene to eat more during the meal.

She handled the host's warmth and courtesy perfectly.

She was completely different from the willful, proud, socially-averse young lady she used to be.

"...Honey, brother-in-law is asking you something?" Irene smiled, but her hand under the table pinched him hard.

Theodore snapped back to attention. "...Sorry, I was thinking about something else. What did you say?"

David: "I noticed you aren't eating much. Would you like me to get you a bowl of rice?"

Theodore waved his hand. "No need, I can help myself…"

"Don't stand on ceremony. We're family." Before he could finish, David had already added two large spoonfuls of white rice to his bowl.

"…"

"Honey, see how considerate brother-in-law is? No wonder our Emilia fell for him." Irene smiled at her husband, but her eyes were full of sarcasm.

Theodore lowered his head to eat, ignoring her.

Irene gritted her teeth in anger but had to suppress her rage.

...

After lunch, David took the initiative to clear the table.

Sophia helped.

Emilia wasn't idle either; while her husband and daughter washed dishes, she wiped the table and cut fruit.

The elderly couple sat on the sofa watching TV.

Sebastian excused himself, citing work, and left first.

Only Theodore and Irene remained.

The old  woman finally found time to ask: "Theodore, what brings you here?"

"Of course I told him." Irene answered with a smile.

The old  woman gave her a surprised look.

"Mom, what's that look for? Shouldn't Theodore, as brother-in-law, be the first to know that our sister has been found? Besides, he's put a lot of effort into searching for Emilia all these years!"

The old  woman: "Is that really what you think?"

"What else could I be thinking? About their past relationship? Whether seeing each other again now might rekindle old flames?"

The old man and old  woman's expressions changed simultaneously.

Theodore's gaze turned cold. "Irene, watch your language! Choose your words carefully!"

"I'm not shouting or causing a scene. Isn't this speaking properly? How should I speak then? 'Theodore~ dear~' like this? Satisfied?"

Theodore: "You're being utterly unreasonable!"

Irene wasn't angry. She glanced at the fuming elderly couple and smiled faintly. "Of course I trust Emilia. She has such a wonderful husband; why would she still be interested in her brother-in-law? I'm just afraid someone's dream hasn't ended after decades, still coveting things they shouldn't!"

"Enough—" Theodore said coldly, "You don't need to use these words to hint at me. Nothing will happen. Even if you do nothing, nothing will occur. And what you can't stop will happen eventually, no matter how hard you try. Are you satisfied with this answer?"

"You—" Irene trembled with anger. She looked at the silent elderly couple and let out a cold laugh. "Fine. You're the family. I'm the outsider. I'm leaving!"

She picked up her bag and strode out.

When Emilia came out with the fruit platter, she didn't see Irene and asked, "Where's sister?"

Theodore: "She had something to attend to and left first."

Emilia didn't think much of it and actively invited Theodore to stay for dinner.

"No, I have work to handle. I should get going."

"So soon?"

Theodore smiled wryly.

Emilia: "Then let me walk you out."

"Alright."

They walked through the garden.

No flowers bloomed in the depths of winter, but the green potted plants were exceptionally well-maintained.

Theodore: "Did you plant these?"

Emilia smiled and shook her head. "I wouldn't know how to handle these. They're all David's treasures. There's even a small vegetable patch in the backyard. The greens we had at lunch were grown by him."

Mentioning David, Emilia's lips unconsciously curved upward.

She didn't notice this small detail herself.

But Theodore saw it clearly.

He couldn't describe the feeling in his heart.

Even though Emilia was right beside him, he felt like a thousand mountains and rivers separated them.
###Chapter 387

Then Go and Take Her.

Theodore and Emilia were no longer the people they once were.

They had built their own families.

Their lives had diverged onto separate paths.

"Do you still remember the dreams we had when we were young?" Theodore broke the silence.

Isabella nodded.

"You loved astronomy. You wanted to join the space agency."

The man offered a bitter smile.

"I was so naive back then. I thought dreams were within easy reach."

"In the end, I took over the family business. I became the heir my parents expected."

Isabella's lips curved into a faint smile.

"The Valdemar name is prestigious now. You've done very well."

But I lost you...

Theodore's words caught in his throat.

He changed the subject, speaking of his experiences over the years.

When he mentioned finally marrying Irene, his tone was hesitant.

He looked into Isabella's calm eyes.

A sudden question escaped him.

"What have you been through all these years?"

"We searched everywhere for you. No one had any news."

"We never imagined you were right here in the neighboring city."

Isabella saw him as an older brother.

She recounted her past in detail.

When he heard she had drifted on the river for a full day and night before being rescued, Theodore's heart clenched.

Isabella sensed his distress.

She offered a gentle smile.

"It's all in the past now... I'm doing well."

Theodore fell silent.

He appeared to have a perfect family. A successful career.

It seemed he had no regrets...

Except for Isabella.

Was he truly happy?

His gaze rested on her, dark and heavy.

After a long moment, he finally asked the question—

"Do you blame me? For marrying your sister after you disappeared?"

Isabella was surprised.

Then she laughed, free and easy.

"No, I don't blame you."

"We both have our own lives now. Let the past stay in the past."

"Cherishing the present is what matters."

...

The night was deep. A cold moon hung in the sky.

Sebastian found himself back at that bar.

"Hey handsome, buy me a drink?" A woman in revealing clothes approached him.

Sebastian pushed her hand away. His smile was cold.

"Number nine."

"...What?" The woman was confused.

"You're the ninth one to hit on me. I told the first eight to get lost."

"What makes you special?"

"Psycho! Who do you think you are, some emperor picking concubines?"

"I'm not an emperor. But you—you can get lost."

"You motherf—" The woman flushed with anger.

Sebastian lifted his cold eyes.

"Before you start cursing, be prepared to get hit."

The woman hesitated, fear flickering in her eyes.

Her friend quickly pulled her away.

"...Stop making trouble!"

"You're not helping me, you're dragging me away?!"

"If I didn't drag you away, once those men in black suits come over, you won't be able to leave!"

"Bodyguards? Who is he?"

"Those two men in suits have their hands in their pockets. They're obviously armed! Only you are blind enough not to see!"

...

Sebastian signaled his bodyguards to move closer.

Finally, there was peace.

He poured a drink slowly.

Unlike yesterday's frantic gulping, his expression was unreadable and detached.

Suddenly, his gaze fixed on a booth not far away.

Tch.

Theodore sensed the stare.

He turned and locked eyes with his son.

The air froze instantly.

Father and son simultaneously looked away.

Sebastian picked up his bottle and walked over. He sat down beside his father.

"Here for a drink?"

Theodore gave him a bland glance.

"What a stupid question."

People come to bars to drink, not to watch movies.

"As for you—" Theodore looked at the bottle in his son's hand. "I thought you quit."

Six months ago, Sebastian had suddenly quit smoking and drinking.

Theodore had been surprised he could stick to it.

How long had it been before he broke?

Sebastian's lips twisted.

"No one cares. Why quit?"

Theodore raised an eyebrow.

"Got dumped by a woman?"

A father knows his son.

Sebastian was silent.

Theodore chuckled.

"Really got dumped? Interesting."

"Don't talk about me. You're not much better," Sebastian retorted.

Theodore's face darkened instantly.

"...What nonsense are you talking?"

Sebastian: "You raced from S City to here. Pushed the accelerator through the floor, didn't you?"

"How many red lights did you run? Do you even have enough points left on your license?"

Theodore: "..."

"Old man, tsk tsk..." Sebastian looked him over. "I never knew you could be so impulsive."

"No wonder Mom is always throwing tantrums."

With every word, Theodore's face grew darker.

Finally, it was black as ink.

"What do you know!"

"It's just that you're hung up on my aunt? But she's with someone else now. You have no chance. Is that so hard to understand?"

Theodore: "..."

"Old man, is my aunt really that great? Enough for you to pine for her for over twenty years..." By the end, Sebastian himself seemed lost in thought.

Yeah, was she really that great?

Worth thinking about day and night?

Theodore wasn't in a hurry to answer.

He picked up his glass and swirled it gently. Suddenly, he smiled—

"We both love red wine. You prefer Pétrus. I prefer Romanée-Conti. Why?"

Sebastian was taken aback.

Theodore threw his head back and drained his glass.

"There's no reason for liking something. You taste the best, and naturally, you fall in love. No reason needed."

"Once you've tasted it, fallen in love, but can't have it... what then?"

Theodore's eyes suddenly turned vicious.

Then, just as quickly, they were calm again—

"You go crazy."

Sebastian's lips curled in self-mockery.

"Even if you go crazy, you still can't have it."

Theodore: "Then go and take her."
###Chapter 388

"Crazier Than Your Old Man"

"Steal?"

Sebastian Evans smirked.

"You'd need the skills to pull it off."

Theodore Valdemar raised an eyebrow. "How do you know without trying?"

"You want to steal my aunt?" Sebastian scoffed. "Grandpa and Grandma would never allow it."

Theodore swirled his glass, silent.

His gaze swept over Sebastian. "So which woman dumped you?"

Sebastian looked away.

"You wouldn't know her."

Theodore didn't press further.

He raised his glass.

"Rare to meet like this. Drink."

Their glasses clinked.

A clear, sharp sound.

Both drained their drinks.

The moonlight grew thicker.

Sebastian's eyes grew hazy with drink.

Theodore remained expressionless.

Two handsome men drinking opposite each other.

Drawing frequent glances from passersby.

Sebastian suddenly put down his glass.

"Dad, how do you make a woman fall for you?"

Before Theodore could answer.

He waved his hand.

"Never mind. Asking you is useless."

Theodore: "..."

His own son knew exactly where to hit.

1 AM.

Father and son left the bar.

Sebastian was too drunk to walk steadily.

Theodore helped him back to the hotel.

They had just entered the room.

Sebastian suddenly stood straight.

"Dad? Why are you here?"

Theodore wiped his sweat.

This rebellious son was definitely doing it on purpose.

Sebastian looked around.

Then it dawned on him.

"Bringing me here to get a room?"

He hugged himself tightly.

"I'm chaste and pure now. Don't try to drag me down."

Theodore narrowed his eyes.

"Chaste for whom?"

Sebastian giggled foolishly.

"Who else?"

He collapsed onto the bed.

Muttering a name.

"Sophia Sullivan."

Theodore froze.

"Who?"

Sebastian was already asleep.

Wrapped in the blanket, breathing evenly.

Theodore stood before the bed.

For a long time.

He finally uttered.

"Crazier than your old man."

He smiled bitterly and shook his head.

Father and son were cut from the same cloth.

Emilia Atlante's face surfaced in his mind.

Twenty years had passed.

Reunited, but everything had changed.

What then, after finding her?

Theodore walked to the floor-to-ceiling window.

The night shrouded his lonely silhouette.

Bleak and desolate.

...

The next day.

Sebastian and Theodore bid their farewells.

Irene Valdemar had already left the city.

The family of three went their separate ways.

Husband and wife not traveling together.

Father and son not on the same path.

Mother and son with even less to say.

The elderly couple understood.

But said nothing.

Isaac and Florence Atlante decided to stay longer.

Mainly to spend more time with their daughter.

The old lady was in high spirits.

No back pain, clear vision.

Cheerful all day long.

The old man directly summoned his private doctor and bodyguards.

Planning an extended stay.

Isabella Sullivan worried David Sullivan wouldn't adjust.

David Sullivan chuckled.

"I'm adjusting! The old lady gardens with me, the old man plays chess with me."

He had been bored during the winter break.

Now it was lively.

Isabella felt relieved.

David Sullivan grinned.

Sophia Sullivan only stayed for two days.

She returned to Kyoto on the third day.

Her experiment wasn't finished.

The paper had to be completed before the new year.

David Sullivan frantically stuffed things into her suitcase.

All homemade salsa and beef jerky.

Sophia had traveled light coming.

But returned with an extra large suitcase.

Hannah Morse came to pick her up in her new BMW.

Her father had wanted to buy a Ferrari.

But Hannah refused.

"Students should keep a low profile."

She chose a BMW herself.

Marcus Lawrence went with her.

After swiping the card.

She was smug.

"See how thrifty I am?"

"Learn from me."

Marcus was speechless.

She blinked.

"Don't you want to buy one?"

Marcus shook his head.

"I can't."

Hannah understood.

"Then you can ride with me in the future."

Marcus smiled and nodded.

"Thank you."

"Don't mention it! We're good sisters!"

Marcus's smile froze.

...

The car stopped at the alley entrance.

Sophia gave some beef to Hannah.

Hannah's eyes lit up.

"Smells amazing!"

She hesitated.

Sophia raised an eyebrow.

"What's wrong?"

"Um... isn't there any for little Marcus?"
Sophia Sullivan paused for a moment, then laughed.

Her eyes curved into crescents.
"Yes! Of course! I'll get it for you. Could you take it to him?"

"Perfect!"

Sophia stuffed several more jars into her car.

"You're the best, Sophia~"

"I think you and Marcus Lawrence would make a good match too."

With that, she got out of the car.
She dragged her suitcase toward the building entrance.

Amelia Roscente completely missed the deeper meaning.
She happily pulled out her phone.

"Hey! Marcus! Are you at the apartment? I'm bringing you salsa and beef jerky! Yes... from Sophia."

On the other end, Marcus's voice was calm.
"I'm here. You can come."

"Great! Twenty minutes."

"Mhm."

The call ended.
Marcus quickly rushed downstairs.
He grabbed his jacket and changed his shoes.
"Grandma, I won't be home for lunch. Or... dinner either!"
###Chapter 389

"Where are you going?"

"Back to the apartment!"

"I thought we agreed you'd eat at home today?"

Marcus was already pushing the door open.
He called back, "Not eating!"

"This kid... what's the rush..."

...

Sophia stopped at the building entrance, catching her breath.

She glanced at the box by her feet.
She looked up at the seventh floor.
She was debating whether to make two trips.
Suddenly, someone passed by her.
They lifted the box and turned to go upstairs.

"Huh?"

Sophia was stunned.

Alexander Laurent didn't hear footsteps following.
He turned back to look at her.
"Aren't you coming up?"

Sophia snapped out of it.
She smiled and hurried after him.
"Coming."

The man carried the large box with ease.
He climbed to the seventh floor without losing his breath.

His effortless strength made Sophia envious.

"Thank you, Professor."

Alexander put the box down.
He gestured for her to open the door.
"In for a penny, in for a pound. I'll help you get it inside."

Sophia quickly fumbled for her keys.

The door opened.
She invited Alexander in.

The man deftly changed into slippers.
He carried the box to her living room.

"I should head back then."

Sophia stopped him.
"Wait a moment."

Alexander raised an eyebrow.
He watched as she crouched down and opened the suitcase right there.

The interior was divided into four compartments.
The salsa and beef jerky were neatly packed.

David Sullivan had used clasps to secure everything.
Sophia retrieved the items easily.

"You mentioned last time that my dad's salsa was good. I told him. He was thrilled. He specifically asked me to bring more for you this time. Here, this bag is his special preparation,指名 for Professor Laurent."

"It has both spicy and numbing spicy flavors. They're great with rice or noodles."

Alexander didn't refuse.
"Please thank your father for me."

He had added David on WeChat.
David occasionally asked him to help find papers.
Back and forth, their relationship felt...
###Chapter 390

More like peers.

Sophia: "My dad also said he'll look you up for chess next time he's in Kyoto."

Alexander: "He's welcome."

...

Though the university was on break, for graduate students, the concept of "winter and summer vacation" barely existed.

Especially for someone like Sophia, who had research projects and could produce papers.
Rest was a luxury.

The School of Life Sciences' monthly symposium proceeded as usual.

After the Infinite Lab's unveiling, where Blake Cunningham and Professor Victoria Lowell had publicly embarrassed themselves, the school had penalized them.
The successive blows had kept Victoria quiet for a while.

Additionally, her designated lab had been reported for failing fire safety inspections.
It was forced to undergo renovations.

It still hadn't passed.

Naturally, there had been no academic output during this period.

At the symposium, Victoria's team was quieter than ever before.

Shane Holloway, who used to bare his teeth like a wild dog ready to bite, now sat as quiet as a mouse.

Amelia's expression was also grim.

With the lab under renovation, the project opportunity she had fought so hard to get from Victoria had evaporated.

She asked Victoria to assign her another project, only to be met with a torrent of abuse—

"Project! Project! I want a project too! The lab is under renovation now! No project can move forward! Where am I supposed to find a project for you?!"

"Even if I had a project, are you sure you could keep up and produce tangible results?"

"Know your limits! Not every graduate student is cut out for academia! Not everyone in academia produces results! Do you really think you're an academic genius? The next Sophia Sullivan?!"

The verbal assault came with a spray of spit.

Fortunately, Amelia dodged quickly, her face unconcealed in its disgust.
"Professor Lowell, that's not what you said when you asked me to buy equipment! I need you to understand, joining a project team wasn't a plea or a negotiation. It was a transaction, as agreed."

"I provide funding, you provide the project. Mutual consent. I've paid. You've reneged. That's not how business is done."

Amelia had completely lost her rose-colored glasses regarding Victoria.

She was just a "snob," "greedy," "petty" academic hack.

Not worthy of respect.

"And stop trying to gaslight me with your rhetoric because—" she enunciated each word, "I don't fall for that crap!"

"You have two weeks to find me a project team to join. I don't care if it's your project or someone else's. I just need to be in one. Understood?!"

She needed this academic experience to buff her resume.
More importantly, for the end-of-term bonus points.

Victoria had taken so much from her.
She couldn't get away with it.

"You're threatening me?!" Victoria hadn't expected the docile lamb to dare bite back.

Amelia nodded.
"You can think of it that way."

Victoria sneered.
"And if I don't?"

"Then prepare to be reported for soliciting and accepting bribes from students! You just got disciplined. Add this to it, and let's see if you can still stay at MIT."

"You—"

Victoria was furious.

Amelia smiled slightly.
"Remember, you only have two weeks."

Victoria talked tough, but she was nervous inside.

She called in every favor, racking her brains to shove Amelia into a friend's project team.

But the things she and Blake had done had already spread within certain circles.
Who would dare get involved now?

Old friends avoided her like the plague.

Who knew who this biting wolf would attack next?

As the two-week deadline approached, Victoria still hadn't found a way.

Amelia wasn't joking.
She was ready to march to the president's office and report her...
Professor Victoria Lowell  sneered. "Go ahead. If I go down, you're coming with me."

"I'm going right now—"

"Amelia Roscente, have you forgotten how you got into graduate school?"

Amelia froze mid-step.

Professor Victoria Lowell  gave a light, dismissive hum. "You didn't actually get in. If I hadn't pulled strings, would you even be standing here?"

"Report me? Be my guest. If I get fired, you, the fake graduate student who bought her way in, will be kicked out too."

Amelia trembled with rage. "You old witch!"

"Vicious?" Professor Victoria Lowell  scoffed. "Takes one to know one."

Amelia's final exam results were a disaster.

She had failed three courses.

Her average in her major subjects was barely over seventy.

It was an embarrassing score to admit.

Even Shane Holloway had scored higher than her.

Every time Victoria Roscente asked about her grades, Amelia would hem and haw.

She finally told the truth when she could no longer hide it.

Victoria had a strong bias for academic credentials, and even more so for good grades.

She thought that since her daughter had gotten into MIT for graduate school, she must be exceptional.

She never expected this...

"Are you trying to kill me with anger?!"

Amelia frantically made excuses. "The exam was unusually difficult this time! Lots of people did poorly."

"What about Sophia Sullivan?"

"..."

"Speak!"

"...Straight A's."

Victoria fell silent.

Ashley Lowell hadn't been having an easy time lately either.

Professor Victoria Lowell  was impossibly difficult to please.

Even though Ashley was extremely careful, she still got yelled at frequently.

She didn't even dare cry when scolded.

Her own aunt didn't treat her like a human being.

Her academic output had also dried up—

The lab was under rectification, so she didn't dare claim credit for Caleb Watson's paper.

With the lab unusable, she couldn't magic up any new papers.

Caleb's research project had also stalled, producing no results at all.

Fortunately, she had a few previous papers to maintain appearances, so her final grades looked slightly better than Amelia's.

But it wasn't enough. Without new papers, how could she maintain her "genius girl" persona?

She messaged Caleb, but he didn't reply.

She had complained to Professor Victoria Lowell  several times, only to be berated harshly each time.

The university was on winter break, but many graduate students stayed on campus to work on their projects.

Others had labs to use and projects to work on.

Only their group...

Staying behind with nothing to do, like stray dogs with no home.

Ashley suggested to Professor Victoria Lowell  that everyone should just go home first.

Since they were just idling away their time anyway.

She was scolded again. "Is that all the ambition you have? If you want to go hide away in some small town, you shouldn't have worked so hard to get into MIT! I gave you honor, taught you to fight and grab opportunities, and now you just want to go home?!"

Ashley cried.

Was it wrong to want to go home? Was lazing around at school considered having ambition?

She only dared scream these words inside her head.

The most comfortable person in the team was Fiona Valentine.

She wasn't like Amelia, desperately squeezing into the research group.

She also wasn't like Ashley, needing papers to maintain a persona.

She wasn't even flustered by her final average of 70, just barely passing.

Her ambitions lay elsewhere, so why exhaust herself?

For women, studying and pursuing higher education was ultimately about marrying a good man, wasn't it?

She sat between Ashley and Amelia, her expression calm.

Like an outsider.

Ashley knew Fiona had a wealthy boyfriend and didn't care about her studies, only wanting to marry into money.

She looked down on this type of "trophy wife" who relied on men.

But Caleb's composure puzzled her.

The lab rectification should have made him the most anxious.

Several important projects were on hold, including provincial-level key projects.

If this dragged on, they wouldn't produce any results next year.

Yet Caleb wasn't worried?

Ashley had tried to sound him out, but he didn't take the bait.

During this period staying on campus, with nothing to do, he took a part-time job at an off-campus research institute.

He left early and returned late; it was impossible to even see him.

She told Professor Victoria Lowell  about Caleb's part-time job.

Professor Victoria Lowell  only said two words—

"Pathetic."

Then she ignored it.

Ashley was stunned.

"Bro," Jude Granger tugged at Caleb's sleeve. "How much longer will the lab be under rectification?"

"Not sure."

"You don't seem worried at all?"

Caleb: "Would worrying help?"

Jude was taken aback, then shook his head. "No."

"Then why worry?"

Jude was silent for a moment. "There's something I've been wanting to ask for a long time."

"Go ahead."

"Before, when Sophia Sullivan's lab was under rectification, they borrowed a lab from Stanford. Couldn't we do the same?"

Caleb lowered his gaze, a mocking smile tugging at his lips. "Theoretically, yes. But we'd actually have to secure one. Do you think no one has tried?"

He looked coldly towards Professor Victoria Lowell  in the front row.

Labs weren't cabbages you could just pick up at the market.

That Sophia could borrow one was a testament to her capability.

What made them so special?

Jude was dejected.

He was the most lost person in the team.

He had studied hard to get into MIT, hoping to learn and find a path in scientific research.

He never expected...

To end up in such a predicament.

"Bro, why do you think we worked so hard to study? What for?"

Everyone said education could change your destiny.

His destiny seemed to have changed, yet it also seemed unchanged.

Caleb was silent for a long time before speaking softly. "Ordinary people don't get to decide their own fate."

"Then who does?"

"We just go with the flow."

Jude became even more disheartened.

After the last group finished their presentation, the Dean stood up to announce some news—

The National Collegiate Life Sciences Championship was about to begin!

"What competition?"

"Organized by the school?"

"You haven't heard of it? It's a national event!"

"Winning the Grand Prize basically guarantees next year's scholarship, and your final grade bonus skyrockets."

"That amazing?"
###Chapter 391

May I See You?

The National Collegiate Life Sciences Championship is held annually.

It was officially included in the National University Competition Rankings three years ago.

It is now a nationally recognized academic competition endorsed by the Ministry of Education.

The competition is divided into two categories: Scientific Inquiry and Innovation & Entrepreneurship.

Different tracks run simultaneously.

It focuses on evaluating students' originality and experimental research processes.

Sophia Sullivan's team naturally planned to participate.

As soon as the news broke, Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence were eager to join.

Extra credit for finals was crucial for them.

Hannah's raw score was eighty-five. She only reached ninety with her paper's bonus points.

Marcus reached ninety-two after the bonus.

Both had tasted the sweetness of extra credit.

Sophia was different.

She sought the challenge.

The extra credit was just a bonus.

Hannah looked up at the sky, speechless.

Marcus silently lowered his head.

Professor Victoria Lowell's team was equally excited.

Amelia Roscente's eyes shone.

Ashley Lowell secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

Without published papers, winning a competition could still maintain her genius persona.

After the Monthly Research Symposium, everyone dispersed.

They discussed the competition in small groups.

The next day, Sophia's team submitted their application form.

While registering, Sophia glanced at Professor Lowell's team's materials.

She noticed Caleb Watson's name was also listed.

But the project leader was Ashley Lowell.

Caleb was only listed as a member.

A third-year graduate student doesn't need to participate in competitions.

He was likely acting as a guidance consultant.

Making Ashley the leader...

Sophia clicked her tongue softly.

Hannah turned her head. "What's wrong, Sophia?"

"Just feeling a bit compliacted."

"About what?"

Sophia said, "Hard work doesn't necessarily guarantee return. Sometimes you just end up doing the work for someone else."

If Caleb himself didn't struggle, no one else could help him.

…

Administrative Building Office.

Bang—

Amelia Roscente pushed the door open and stormed in.

The door slammed against the wall with a loud crash.

"Victoria Lowell, are you betting I won't dare to report you?"

"Are you insane? Causing a scene in my office!" Professor Lowell did not back down.

After getting a handle on Amelia, she had figured out her background.

All bark and no bite.

She didn't have the guts for mutually assured destruction.

Otherwise, she wouldn't have waited until now.

Amelia crossed her arms. "What do you mean by making Ashley the leader? Is she even qualified?"

"Not her, then you? Ridiculous."

"You—"

Professor Lowell brushed her hand away. "Have you published any papers? Any academic output? A leader needs to command respect."

"I may not have papers, but we both know how Ashley got her so-called output."

Professor Lowell's eyes flickered.

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"The Roscente family has no shortage of money and connections. Investigating Ashley was easy. Guess what I found out?"

Professor Lowell's face changed dramatically.

Amelia said, "Professor Lowell's last name is Lowell. Ashley's last name is also Lowell. What a coincidence."

"So what!" Her voice wavered.

Amelia curled her lip. "Ashley's grades were terrible in middle school. She suddenly became a genius in high school, winning competitions, publishing papers. Should I dig deeper?"

"You—" Professor Lowell trembled with anger.

She regretted letting Amelia join the team.

She thought she was a simple-minded rich girl, but she was actually shrewd.

Amelia said, "Make me the second-in-command. Or you and your niece are both finished."

She turned and left.

Amelia's name was added to the application form.

Jude Granger looked at Caleb in shock. "...Why?"

"No reason. The world is inherently unfair."

Caleb remained calm and unruffled.

Jude was even more confused.

…

The competition rules involved choosing your own topic, with a time limit for submission and review.

The judging committee would select the Grand Prize, first, second, and third place awards.

Sophia's team quickly decided on their project direction.

The choice of project leader was unquestionable.

Hannah and Marcus said in unison, "Sophia will lead!"

Sophia did not decline.

It was settled easily.

Time flew by. Another strong cold front arrived.

The project concluded smoothly.

The three of them worked day and night in the lab.

They finally finished on time.

Hannah let out a long sigh of relief.

Marcus, with dark circles under his eyes, finally relaxed.

Sophia said, "Take two days off. Recover your energy."

"Yay— Long live Sophia!"

It was Sophia's first time going home in a week.

She took a quick shower and collapsed into bed.

She slept soundly through the night without any dreams.

The next day, she woke up naturally.

Her phone showed it was noon.

She got up, washed up, and ate a quick bite.

She started a deep cleaning, loosening the soil and watering the plants.

After tidying up, she changed clothes and went out to buy groceries.

Just as she was about to step out, Sebastian Evans called.

It was their first call since returning from the other city.

"I'm downstairs at your place. May I see you?"

The man's voice was low and hoarse.
###Chapter 392

Sophia Sullivan gripped her phone, her fingertips tightening slightly.

A soft chuckle came from the other end of the line. "What's wrong? You called me 'brother' so easily, but now you hesitate to meet? Or... you never really wanted to acknowledge me as your brother? Were all those words before just lies?"

"I'll be right down," Sophia replied decisively.

Sebastian Evans was right. Given their current relationship, there shouldn't be any barriers between them.

Her quick agreement actually caused a brief silence on the other end.

The man's deep voice returned. "Grandpa and Grandma are back from their trip. They heard your project just wrapped up and asked me to pick you up for dinner at the old house."

The elderly couple had been staying in the neighboring city for a while, enjoying it so much they were reluctant to leave.

Seeing their daughter every day, with David Sullivan, their son-in-law, attentively caring for them, their days were utterly comfortable.

That was until Isabella received an invitation from her publisher to do a book signing in G City, followed by a reader meet-and-greet in Shanghai.

David, of course, planned to go with her.

The publisher generously covered all expenses, practically begging her to participate in more events.

They had pulled out all the stops to get Isabella to agree to these in-person activities.

The grandparents initially wanted to tag along, but Isabella was the first to object, concerned about the long journey's effect on Grandma's health.

She suggested flying to G City alone, leaving David home to care for his parents.

David had no objections.

But Grandpa and Grandma insisted that David accompany Isabella, so they could look after each other.

Everyone was thinking of the others' well-being.

David became the prized commodity, grinning from ear to ear. Besides teaching, he'd never felt so indispensable in his life.

Finally, Isabella gave in to her parents' wishes and brought David along.

Once their daughter and son-in-law left, the grandparents simply returned to Kyoto.

Their home was still here, and they had been away for some time.

Even if they planned to move to the neighboring city permanently someday, that required careful long-term planning.

Their granddaughter was still here. Having her over for meals sometimes to make sure she ate well was a good thing too.

Sophia said, "I'm coming down now."

"Wait..." Sebastian suddenly spoke.

"What is it?"

"Ahem... Would it be okay if I came up? I need to use your restroom."

Sophia replied, "Okay, come on up."

…

This was Sebastian's first time visiting Sophia's apartment.

He glanced around. A vase sat on the coffee table, the flowers inside gone, only a lone leaf pressed at the bottom.

The fish tank was spotless, a few goldfish swimming leisurely inside.

This was her private space. Not large, but warm, tidy, and full of traces of life.

Sophia invited him in and turned to make tea. "The restroom is over there... The slippers on the floor are new, you can change into them…"

Sebastian looked down and saw a pair of clearly worn men's slippers placed next to the new ones.

His eyes darkened. It took him a few seconds to suppress the surge of emotion before he walked straight to the restroom.

There were no men's toiletries inside.

"The Maojian tea was bought by my dad last time he visited. It's quite good, try it." Sophia placed the teacup on the coffee table and looked up at Sebastian emerging from the restroom.

She paused slightly.

The man wore a well-tailored black overcoat that emphasized his broad shoulders and narrow waist, his figure excellent.

But his cheeks seemed thinner, slightly hollowed, making his eyes appear even deeper.

Sebastian gave a slight smile, picked up the teacup. The warmth seeped through the porcelain into his palm. "I'm not picky about tea. Thank you."

Sophia said, "Have a seat for a moment. I'll just grab a few things, then we can go?"

"Okay."

Sebastian watched her retreating back, then looked down at the clear tea in his cup.

He had asked her half-jokingly many times before if he could come up for a cup of tea. Each time, Sophia had refused.

Now he was here openly. She made tea for him, even handed it to him.

Sebastian didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

This change was something he had hoped for countless times. Now it had happened, but because their relationship had changed—

Not into lovers, but into siblings?

How ironic!

A bitter taste spread on his tongue. He couldn't spit it out, could only swallow.

It was minus three degrees today. Sophia, afraid of the cold, wore a light pink mid-length down jacket over a light camel cashmere sweater and a wool skirt that ended just where the coat did.

Paired with knee-high boots, she looked youthful and vibrant.

Her delicate features were clear, her complexion rosy from a good rest yesterday, her eyes bright. "Alright, brother, let's go."

Her voice was like a feather lightly brushing over his heart.

Itchy and tingling.

"...Brother?"

Sebastian snapped back to reality, standing up a bit abruptly. "Yeah, let's go."

He turned and headed for the entryway first.

As he turned, his Adam's apple bobbed uncontrollably. He felt parched, his hands at his sides slowly clenching into fists.

Restrained and suppressed.

Sophia followed behind him. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw the two extra sandwiches on the dining table and picked them up to put in the refrigerator.

Sebastian said, "Give them to me."

"?"

"The sandwiches. I haven't had lunch."

"One or both?"

Sebastian cleared his throat lightly. "One is enough. Thank you."

As she opened the door, the apartment opposite also opened.

Alexander Laurent stood there holding a trash bag, apparently about to take it out.

Both parties paused in surprise.

Sebastian's lips curved into a sudden smile. "Professor Laurent, not at the lab today? What a coincidence, running into you here."

Alexander looked him up and down, frowning slightly. "What are you doing here?"

"Is it strange that I'm here? Of course, Sophia invited me up."

As he spoke, he even reached up to adjust his collar.

"Professor, heading out? Perfect, we were just leaving."

Alexander's dark gaze swept over the sandwich in Sebastian's hand.

Beneath the calm, a sharp intensity flashed.

Others might not notice, but Sebastian saw it clearly. He didn't avoid it but met it head-on with a smile, explaining unprompted,

"Oh, this is a sandwich Sophia made. She saw I hadn't eaten lunch and was worried I'd be hungry."

"First time having one?"

Sebastian: "?"

"Bacon or pork floss?"

"??"

Alexander said, "I still prefer ham. Cheese and corn is pretty good too."

The smile on Sebastian's lips slowly faded, eventually pressing into a tight line.

Hehe?

No hehe.
###Chapter 393

Alexander Laurent's gaze swept over the food container.

His tone was calm. "Corn and pork floss flavor."

Sebastian Evans paused mid-motion.

"I've tried it a few times before. Recognized it immediately."

Sebastian's fingertips tightened slightly.

Alexander continued. "Sophia is always so thoughtful. She remembers everyone's preferences."

Sebastian's lips curved into a faint smile. "They say Professor Laurent is a man of few words. You're quite talkative today."

"That depends on the person." Alexander looked up. "Just like you, Mr. Evans. Usually so reserved, yet exceptionally warm today. It's only polite to reciprocate."

Sebastian's eyes darkened.

Sophia Sullivan walked out from the kitchen, having finished cleaning.

She smiled when she saw Alexander. "You're here today, Professor?"

Alexander's expression softened. "Heading out?"

"Yes, we—"

Sebastian naturally took her bag. "We can't park long at the alley entrance. We should go."

Sophia nodded. "Goodbye, Professor."

Alexander watched them leave.

He stood still, his gaze deepening.

In the car.

Sophia asked softly, "When did your grandparents return?"

Sebastian held the steering wheel. "Last Friday."

Sophia thought for a moment. "Let's stop by the supermarket on the way. I'll buy some fruit."

"For whom?"

"Your grandparents, of course."

Sebastian shook his head. "No need to be so formal. You don't need to bring gifts to your own home."

"Is it really okay to visit empty-handed for the first official meeting?"

"Bringing gifts would create distance. They'd think you were being too polite."

Sophia hesitated briefly. "I'll follow your lead then."

The Atlante family estate was situated by the back lake.

Grey tiles and white walls surrounded elegant pavilions and waterside gazebos.

Unlike common European-style villas, this residence blended Chinese aesthetics with modern design.

Two stately pine trees stood guard at the entrance.

Sophia had just stepped into the foyer when the elderly lady came forward.

"Clara, you're here! Come in, come and sit."

The old woman's eyes were filled with joy.

Sophia greeted them obediently. "Grandpa. Grandma."

The old  woman took her hand and led her to the living room.

"These are all the fruits you like. Freshly washed."

The old man approached carrying a tea set. "Was the journey tiring? Have some tea... or would you prefer something else? We have everything here."

Sophia smiled. "Tea is perfect."

The old man's eyes lit up. "You enjoy tea?"

"Yes."

"This year's fresh pre-Qingming Longjing tea. Please, try it..."

The old  woman stood up. "I'll check on the kitchen. I'll add a couple more of your favorite dishes."

Sophia quickly said, "Grandma, please don't go to too much trouble."

The old  woman felt a warmth in her heart. "It's no trouble at all. Cooking for you makes me happy."

Sebastian stood to the side, his gaze thoughtful.

It had been a long time since he'd seen his grandmother cook.

After Emilia went missing, the old  woman had spent her days weeping.

Now that their daughter was found, she had come back to life.

Sophia gradually relaxed.

She accompanied the old man, sipping tea and chatting.

Speaking of Isabella's past, the old man couldn't help but sigh. "You look so much like your mother when she was young. How did we not recognize it before?"

Sophia was curious. "What was Mom like back then?"

The old man fell into reminiscence. "Your mother, when she was little... so adorable and mischievous. She was the child everyone doted on the most, and also the one who gave everyone the biggest headaches."
Headache?
###Chapter 394
How could anyone describe Isabella that way?

Sophia was intrigued.

Isaac chuckled and shook his head.

"Your mother seems quiet now, but she was quite the troublemaker as a child."

"Climbing trees for birds, wading into streams for fish—she did it all."

Sophia's eyes widened.

"Really?"

"The sixty-eight railings along the covered walkways in Atlante Gardens were added later."

"Because of my mother?"

Isaac lowered his voice.

"To prevent her from jumping into the ornamental ponds to catch fish."

Sophia was speechless.

She couldn't picture Isabella ever being like that.

"Surprised?"

Sophia shook her head.

"It's unbelievable."

Isaac laughed heartily.

"I'll show you your mother's childhood photos later."

"We kept them all. Plenty of evidence."

Sophia's eyes lit up.

"Can we go now?"

The old man nodded happily.

"Of course!"

Grandfather and granddaughter headed eagerly upstairs.

Sebastian returned to the living room after his call.

It was empty.

He searched the first floor twice.

Finally, he entered the kitchen.

"Grandma, where are Grandpa and Sophia?"

"They were just in the living room."

"I don't see them."

Florence wiped her hands.

"Maybe they went somewhere else. Let them be."

"Aren't you working late? Head to the office."

Sebastian didn't move.

"I'm not busy."

Florence looked at him curiously.

The housekeeper had just mentioned work calls coming in on the landline.

Before Sebastian could search further, Isaac and Sophia came downstairs.

Florence emerged from the kitchen.

The family settled on the sofa to look through the photo album.

"This is your mother right after she was born. Six pounds, eight ounces…"

"This one at three years old. Her great-aunt Deborah gave her her first pair of high heels…"

The album documented Isabella's growth.

Every photo was filled with memories.

After Isabella disappeared, the album pages remained blank.

But it became Florence's solace, a way to remember her daughter.

The cover was worn, clearly from frequent handling.

Sophia turned to the last page and made a soft sound of surprise.

Florence smiled.

"Found it? That's you as a child."

Placed alongside photos of Isabella from the same age.

Florence gently traced the image with her finger.

"Don't you look alike?"

Before Sophia returned to her city, Florence had specifically asked for her photo.

"Your mother had a mole here. It faded as she grew up."

"You have the exact same spot."

Florence couldn't stop talking about Isabella.

Sophia had always thought she resembled her father.

But seeing the photos, she realized she looked like her mother too.

"Grandma, could I have this one?"

She wanted to take it back as a keepsake.

Florence nodded with a smile.

"Of course."

She removed the photo and watched Sophia carefully put it away.

The laugh lines around Florence's eyes deepened.

"The weather is nice. Shall we take a walk in the garden?"

"Sure, I didn't get a good look earlier."

Florence's back often ached, making prolonged sitting uncomfortable.

Sophia had been wanting to stroll with her.

The sky was a pale gray-blue.

Sunlight occasionally broke through the clouds.

Green was rare in Kyoto's deep winter.

But the Atlante garden was different.

Lush flowers and plants thrived in the glass greenhouse.

Creating the most vibrant colors of the season.

Gardening was Florence's favorite pastime.

She had initially lost interest.

Isaac built this garden to distract her.

From initial reluctance, she gradually grew fond of it.

Florence put on her gloves and knelt to weed.

Sophia helped prune branches and loosen soil around the plants.

Florence glanced at her.

Her movements were skilled, clearly experienced with plants.

She also knew about plant needs and proper watering.

"Sophia, you're not just a good student. You have a green thumb too."

Few young people had such patience nowadays.

"You're the one with the green thumb, Grandma. I'm just helping."

The trailing jasmine at their feet was flourishing.

It would be even lovelier soon.

Florence shook her head with a smile.

"You always know just what to say to make me happy."

"It's the truth."

"Look at this rose. It's blooming like a cabbage…"

Sophia frowned at the overly full rose.

Then she laughed at herself.

Florence joined in the laughter.

She looked at Sophia with tender eyes.

As if seeing Isabella through her.

Lost time, regained in another form.

…

Florence and Sophia spent an hour in the garden.

Seeing Florence tired, Sophia helped her back to her room to rest.

Before going upstairs, Florence called for Sebastian.

She took Sophia's hand.

"Your room is upstairs. Sebastian prepared it himself."

"Let him show you."

With that, Florence and Isaac went upstairs to rest.

Only Sophia and Sebastian remained in the living room.

He broke the silence.

"It's on the second floor, left side. Want to see it?"

"Okay. Thank you."

Sophia followed him upstairs.

Sebastian spoke as they walked.

"It's a suite with a balcony."

"It faces the garden greenhouse. Nice view."

He didn't tell Sophia.

He had chosen this room for her.

He thought she would like it.

"Here we are."

After a few steps, they stopped at a door.
###Chapter 395

Sebastian Evans gestured for her to open the door.

Sophia Sullivan reached for the doorknob.

She gave it a gentle push.

The door swung open.

She had always known Sebastian had excellent taste.

But the sight before her still exceeded all expectations.

The air carried a faint scent of mint.

It was her favorite fragrance.

The entire room was decorated in light tones.

The warm, soft beige of the walls.

Thick, plush carpeting covered the wooden floor.

It would feel wonderful under bare feet.

A full-wall bookcase stood against one wall.

A reading chair was placed in front of it.

Sunlight streamed in through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

She imagined reading here.

It would be pure bliss.

The room also had a small side table and a cozy beanbag chair.

It even included a compact tea station.

She drew back the curtains.

Outside was a private balcony.

The view was expansive.

She could see distant mountains and forests.

It was utterly breathtaking.

"Do you like it?"

Sophia turned to look at Sebastian.

She nodded.

"Thank you. I love it."

Her gaze returned to the window.

"Everything right now feels like a dream."

"When I read fairy tales as a child."

"Cinderella becoming a princess and returning to the castle."

"This must be how it felt."

Her tone was light.

Her expression calm.

Though delighted, she wasn't swept away.

Sebastian spoke suddenly.

"You're not Cinderella."

Sophia raised an eyebrow at him.

"Cinderella is always fragile."

"Always waiting for the prince to save her."

"You wouldn't."

"You would take the initiative to break free."

"You would save yourself."

Sebastian's lips curved into a slight smile.

"You're not Cinderella."

"You're more like Elsa."

"Brave and full of wisdom."

Sophia couldn't help but laugh.

"Such high praise from you, brother?"

"Must be seeing me through rose-colored glasses?"

The man's smile faded.

"It's an objective assessment."

"Sebastian…"

"I know what you're going to say."

He interrupted her calmly.

"To you."

"I have many identities."

"Your ex-boyfriend's close friend."

"A friend who helped you."

"Your cousin by blood."

"A potential business partner."

"But never…"

"Could I be your boyfriend."

Sophia pressed her lips together.

She remained silent.

"Curious why I like you?"

Sebastian gazed into the distance.

He continued without waiting for her answer.

"Some people."

"You meet them just once."

"And they become the unparalleled sea, the peerless cloud."

After that.

Water is merely water.

Clouds are merely clouds.

He suddenly turned his head.

His deep, dark eyes fixed on her.

His gaze held an unspoken fondness and deep attachment.

Sophia thought he would say more.

But he didn't.

He just looked at her.

With an intensity she felt she couldn't reciprocate.

"There are many kinds of love in this world."

"And more than one type of relationship between people."

"Lovers may part."

"But family is forever."

"Isn't that good enough?"

Sebastian smiled.

Noncommittal.

"Our relationship now."

"Has at least one advantage for me."

"From now on, I can protect you openly."

"Keep you from harm."

"Since you call me brother."

"Don't ever worry about owing me favors in the future."

"Don't carry any psychological burden."

"Just come to me."

"A sister ordering her brother around."

"Is only natural."

"Okay."

Sophia breathed a soft sigh of relief.

She thought he had accepted the title of brother.

And presumably abandoned those unrealistic ideas.

But what she didn't see.

Was after she turned away.

The look Sebastian gave her retreating figure was dark and heavy.

Like two bottomless whirlpools.

Beneath the surface lay suppressed deep affection and an unshakable obsession.

Dinnertime.

The elderly lady led Sophia to the dining table.

"These are dishes your mother said you liked."

"I hope they suit your taste."

"Sit down and try them."

Sophia was mentally prepared.

But she was still astonished by the table laden with food.

They were indeed all her favorites.

"This is too much."

Florence Atlante waved her hand with a smile.

"Not at all, not at all."

"Just take a bite of each."

Touched, Sophia was effusive in her praise.

"Grandmother, you're amazing."

"It already smells delicious."

Florence beamed.

"For my precious granddaughter."

"This is nothing."

"If you like it, come every day."

"Grandmother will cook delicious food for you daily."

Isaac Atlante pretended to be jealous.

"Grandmother hasn't cooked in so many years."

"Today she prepares such a feast."

"Only you get this treatment."

"Sebastian and I are just extras."

"Not important, not important."

Sebastian nodded in agreement.

"Grandmother used to favor me the most."

"But now the new replaces the old."

Florence shot them a look.

"Shoo, shoo."

"I'm talking to my granddaughter."

"Stop causing trouble."

She pulled Sophia to sit on her right.

Directly separating her from Isaac.

The old man chuckled in mock exasperation.

Just a few comments.

And she was really being petty.

But he looked at Sophia speaking softly.

Then at the joy in his wife's eyes.

The smile on his lips deepened unconsciously.

It was good.

The hardships were over.

The storm had finally passed, and the sky was clear again.
###Chapter 396

Sebastian Evans set down his chopsticks.

“It’s Sophia’s first time here, and the table is full. How about a group photo to remember this?”

The elderly couple’s eyes lit up.

They hadn’t taken a single picture with their granddaughter yet!

The old man nodded eagerly. “We should. We must.”

The old woman added quickly, “Sebastian, find a good angle. We’ll have it printed for the album.”

A slight smile touched Sebastian’s lips. “I won’t be in it. The housekeeper can take it.”

“Oh, my memory! I forgot you need to be in the photo too…”

Sebastian waved the housekeeper over.

Sophia Sullivan moved obediently to her grandmother’s side, linking arms with her.

Sebastian stood on her other side, with the grandfather on the far left.

“Ready?” The housekeeper held up the phone.

The grandmother chuckled. “Go ahead, take it.”

Click—

The moment was captured.

The elderly couple beamed, Sophia smiled softly, and Sebastian’s lips curved slightly.

The housekeeper took several more shots in quick succession.

The elderly couple looked through the photos, pleased with every single one.

The housekeeper returned the phone to Sebastian.

The grandmother didn’t forget to remind him, “Remember to get them printed!”

“Don’t worry, I won’t forget.”

Only then did the grandmother feel at ease.

Sebastian scrolled through the photos, a flicker of amusement in his eyes.

He considered giving the housekeeper a raise.

He took a few more pictures of the dining table before putting his phone away and sitting down.

…

After dinner, Sophia stayed to watch TV with her grandmother.

The grandfather had made plans to take a walk with an old neighbor.

His booming voice could be heard from a distance. “…Found her! In the next city, she’s married now…”

“What does she do? Writes novels, suspense… yes, she wrote ‘The Seven-Day Tales’… You’ve heard of it? Wonderful! You must read it!”

“My granddaughter is visiting today… getting her Master’s at MIT, very academic… still single…”

“Haha… Heaven has been good to me…”

The grandmother sniffed lightly. “Don’t mind him. He never used to socialize. Now he’s constantly arranging tea, forcing meetings even when he’s busy. He’s terrified people won’t know how happy he is.”

Sophia couldn’t hold back a laugh.

“You think it’s funny too? When I tell him, he justifies it. Says he held it in for over twenty years, shouldn’t he be allowed to show off a little?”

Florence Atlante wanted to show off too.

But she was afraid. Afraid that too much pride would make her lose this happiness.

So she was more restrained than the grandfather, yet she couldn’t help her envy.

Sophia gently held her grandmother’s hand. “Grandma, don’t be afraid. It’s all in the past. From now on, you can boast as much as you want.”

Florence was startled. She hadn’t expected her granddaughter to see right through her.

“Alright then… just like a regular old lady?”

“Yes!”

Sebastian sat on the sofa opposite, seemingly scrolling through his phone, but his attention never left Sophia.

Watching her laugh and talk with her grandmother, listening to her soft words of comfort, he found himself smiling as Florence did.

Sebastian opened his photo album and found the group picture.

In the photo, Sophia was leaning affectionately against her grandmother, her expression gentle.

He stood right beside her, close yet separated by an invisible distance.

Sebastian’s smile faded slightly.

He swiped left and saw the photos of the dining table.

On an impulse, he opened his social media and posted one.

His caption: Reunion.

Likes poured in quickly. The comments section buzzed with activity—

[Family dinner?]

[Sebastian, introducing a new flame to the parents?]

[Finally something other than financial news on your feed!]

[Quietly making big moves, I see.]

[We agreed to stay single together. How could you sneak off like this?]

[This caption… wedding bells?]

Sebastian skimmed them, then paused.

He opened the photo and zoomed in. In the top right corner, he found half of Sophia’s face.

Just her chin and lips were visible, but it was enough to spark everyone’s imagination.

Sebastian frowned. He thought about explaining but decided it was unnecessary.

They were just jokes. A specific denial would only seem suspicious.

A notification chimed.

A message from the hot pot restaurant owner—

[Congrats, man!]

[Next hot pot is on the house.]

Sebastian: “…”

He read it and didn’t reply.

…

Night deepened, neon lights glittering.

Charlie Lowell set up a gathering, inviting Julian Winston and Ethan Roscente.

Julian initially refused. “Picking Olivia up from work. Can’t make it.”

Five minutes later, he called back—

“Free now. On my way.”

Charlie was confused. “What happened?”

“Olivia’s working overtime,” Julian said after a pause. “All night.”

Charlie was speechless.

Olivia, Olivia, Olivia…

Think you’re so great because you have a girlfriend?

It’s not even real.

Charlie said, “You’re not actually falling for her, are you?”

Silence for two seconds, then fury on the other end. “…Get lost! How could I be into that she-devil? Are you insane?”

“Heh, that’s what I thought. She’s not your type anyway. Room 7029. Hurry up.”

When Julian arrived, Charlie and Ethan were already there.

“Well, look who’s here~” Charlie grinned. “Ordered two lovely ladies for you. You’ll love them.”

Julian frowned. “Who said you could order for me?”

Charlie was surprised. “What did you say?”

Julian rolled his eyes. “Don’t just send anyone my way. I’m picky.”

“It’s not your first time. You know the quality here.”

Julian sniffed. “My standards are higher now. I don’t touch the average ones.”

Charlie looked at him like he’d seen a ghost. “Whoa, the sun must be rising in the west!”

Julian didn’t want to explain further. “Send them away. And I’ll say it again—I didn’t order them. Don’t go ruining my reputation.”

Charlie: “?”

He had a reputation?

Julian walked straight into the private room and slumped onto the sofa.

A few familiar rich kids showed up. Not close, but enough to make a table.

Julian joined the card game, completely ignoring the women around him.

Charlie: ?

Had he really changed?
###Chapter 397

Charlie Lowell looked out the window.

The sun rose in the east and set in the west, as it always did.

The Earth continued its rotation and revolution.

His gaze shifted to the other side of the sofa.

He couldn't help but sigh.

Ethan Roscente drank one glass after another.

He didn't touch the cards.

He didn't play pool.

He frowned whenever a woman approached.

Others watched and shook their heads.

"Is Brother Roscente planning to become a monk?"

"Nonsense! He's lovesick!"

"If you ask me, all women are the same. You can get them with money. Why bother?"

Charlie listened as their comments grew more offensive.

"Shut up, all of you."

Someone almost mentioned that name.

Charlie's scalp prickled.

That was Ethan Roscente's minefield.

One touch, and he'd explode.

Julian Winston threw down his cards.

"This is so boring! Are you guys cheating?"

Charlie rolled his eyes. "Who are you blaming for your own bad luck?"

"Alright, Charlie, feeling brave now?"

"Thanks for the compliment."

Julian snorted and stood up.

The card game disbanded.

Charlie scrolled through his phone out of boredom.

A post from Sebastian Evans popped up on his feed.

"Reunion?" He frowned and tapped to open it.

The photo was filled with an array of delicious food.

A half-face in the upper right corner made him freeze.

He zoomed in for a closer look.

The jawline was familiar.

The curve of the lips was recognizable.

It was Sophia Sullivan!

Footsteps sounded behind him.

His phone was suddenly snatched away.

Ethan Roscente stared at the screen.

His pupils constricted sharply.

He zoomed in on the photo again and again.

Confirming it was her.

Charlie's heart sank.

Oh no.

Julian leaned over to see what was happening.

"Oh, Sophia Sullivan?"

"Isn't that the Atlante residence in the background?"

"Meeting the parents?"

Ethan's face turned ashen.

Charlie frantically tried to signal with his eyes.

Julian pretended not to see.

"Sebastian moves fast."

"The comments are all praising how impressive he is."

Ethan grabbed his jacket and left.

Charlie tried to stop him.

"Stay a bit longer?"

Ethan didn't look back.

Julian shook his head with a laugh.

"Always so dramatic."

Charlie glared, furious.

"My eyes are about to twitch out of their sockets from signaling you!"

Julian shrugged.

"I did it on purpose."

"..."

"Who told him to come out and still wear that sour face."
###Chapter 398

He thought he was truly sick.

What was he pretending to be, some deeply devoted lover?

He deserved this.

Where was all this effort earlier?

Charlie sighed. "When will Ethan ever move on? Sophia has already started looking forward."

"Hah—" Julian scoffed. "Him? Just wait. As long as Sophia doesn't look back, he'll remember her for a lifetime."

Charlie: "Why?"

Julian: "How does that lyric go? 'You always want what you can't have.' People are just pathetic. You guys have fun, I'm heading out."

"You just got here."

Julian raised an eyebrow. "Olivia's overtime got canceled last minute. I'm picking her up."

Charlie's expression turned knowing. "And that's not turning fake into real?"

Julian waved him off. "What do you know? The act has to be convincing. A boyfriend picking up his girlfriend after work is natural. How else will the family believe we're seriously dating?"

"Time's up. I'm out!" He turned and left.

Charlie was left utterly confused.

Lately, everyone seemed to be under some kind of spell.

Something was off.

Very off.

...

The winter rain drizzled. A bitter wind cut to the bone.

Before eight, the streets were already deserted.

Ethan left the nightclub. He drove straight to Sophia's place.

Jealousy and resentment churned inside him the whole way.

Accusatory questions swirled in his mind—

Didn't you say you weren't close to Sebastian?

Didn't you say it was impossible?

Why did you go home with him to meet his family?

Are you together now?

What's so great about Sebastian?

Why him?

But when he actually reached her building, he didn't dare go up.

He could only sit in his car. He watched the rain hit the windshield, sliding down in streaky patterns.

Ethan's lips curved into a self-mocking smile.

He laughed at his own foolishness and childishness.

He didn't know how long he sat there. Just as he was about to leave, a familiar car came into view.

The rain had stopped.

Sebastian got out. He opened the passenger door.

Sophia got out.

They were talking. Sebastian was smiling. Sophia nodded occasionally.

Sebastian opened the trunk. He pulled out numerous bags and packages.

It looked like they'd just visited family. They brought back a pile of gifts.

Sebastian said, "Grandma specifically insisted. These bird's nest soups, foie gras, truffles—they're all for you."

"This bag is tea from the old man's private stash."

"You liked the tea set in the bedroom. I ordered a smaller version. It'll arrive after the new year."

"And these..."

Sebastian listed them one by one. Sophia was dazzled.

"It's too much..."

"This is after we pared it down. There was originally more."

Sophia fell silent.

The old man and his wife had wanted her to stay.

There were plenty of rooms. She could have lived there permanently.

They would have been thrilled.

But Sophia had to go to the lab tomorrow. Sebastian had to drive her home.

As she was leaving, the old lady held her hand. She repeatedly told her to visit often.

She also stuffed her full of bags. Everything from daily necessities to jewelry and food. You name it.

Every time she traveled, her father, David, would cram her suitcase with food.

She thought she only experienced this "burdensome love" twice a year. Turns out she was naive.

Seeing the preparations the elderly couple made, Sophia realized her father had actually been very restrained.

You can't refuse the kindness of elders.

But getting it all upstairs became a problem.

Sebastian understood. "I'll help you carry it up."

He led the way forward.

Sophia followed gratefully. "Let me take a few bags..."

This scene landed in Ethan's eyes.

It stung, making his eyes burn.

Watching Sebastian's retreating figure, he punched the steering wheel.

He wanted to rush down. He wanted to grab the other man by the collar and punch him hard.

But then he thought—

What right did he have to start a fight?

The ex-boyfriend who couldn't let go?

Or the former best friend?

He gave a twisted smile. In the end, he just watched silently as the two went upstairs.

...

The things were delivered. Sebastian prepared to leave.

Sophia poured him a glass of water and handed it over. "Thanks, Sebastian. Have some water before you go."

Sebastian looked up. "Alright."

Sophia started tidying the things briefly. She planned to sort them properly tomorrow.

Suddenly, a loud bang sounded. The wind had picked up.

She hadn't closed the balcony door during the day. Now it slammed shut violently.

She remembered the potted plants were still on the balcony. If the wind blew them down and they hit someone, it would be trouble.

Sophia stopped what she was doing. She hurried to move the plants.

One pot was particularly heavy. She tried a few times but couldn't lift it.

A pair of hands reached over. They steadily picked up the flowerpot.

Sebastian said, "I'll do it."

Sophia breathed a sigh of relief. "Thanks, Sebastian."

As she pulled her hand back, she accidentally brushed against Sebastian. She didn't pay it any mind.

The man's gaze tightened slightly. But he didn't show any emotion.

Watching him easily move the parlor palm inside, Sophia pointed to a few other pots. "These need to be moved too..."

Sebastian laughed, exasperated. "Do I look like a mover?"

Sophia shook her head. "No. But you're my... you know. You said it yourself. If I have trouble, I should find my... you know."

Sebastian was left speechless.

To hell with "you know"!

He thought he was truly sick. Any term of address sounded incredibly sweet coming from her lips.

Normally, tending to plants didn't seem like much. But moving them pot by pot indoors made Sophia realize how exhausting it was.

They finally finished. She was about to go to the balcony to get the watering can when Sebastian spoke. "You've got mud on your face."

Sophia: "Here?"

"No." Sebastian pulled out a tissue. He stepped forward. He was about to raise his hand to wipe it for her.

Sophia took two steps back. She took a small mirror from the drawer. She wiped her face while looking in the mirror.

She smiled as she wiped. "Isn't this easier? No need to trouble you."

Sebastian calmly withdrew his hand. He suppressed the turmoil in his eyes. He gave a light laugh. "If there's nothing else, I'll head out."

"Okay." Sophia saw him to the door.

Downstairs at the alley entrance.

Ethan hadn't left.

He'd sat in his car for half an hour. He stared at the building entrance, restless and uneasy.

He'd run through every possible scenario in his head.

Watching the lit window on the seventh floor, he restrained himself repeatedly to keep from going up and knocking.

Would Sebastian stay the night?

The moment the word "cohabitation" surfaced, Ethan felt a heart-rending pain.

Just as he was despairing, he suddenly saw Sebastian walk out of the building.

At that moment, the tightly drawn string in his heart loosened. He felt relief, but it was filled with bitterness.

Knock knock—

Ethan turned his head. He rolled down the window.

Sebastian stood by the car. He wore a faint, mocking smile. "This isn't a coincidence this time, is it?"

That lousy excuse had been used too many times. Probably even he didn't believe it anymore.

Ethan gripped the steering wheel tightly. His eyes narrowed. "You knew I was downstairs."

It was a statement.

"Correct." Sebastian told the truth.

Ethan's fingers turned white. His heart felt like ants were gnawing at it. "Are you two together now?"

Sebastian gave a light laugh. He refused to answer.

Even if they weren't together now, even if they were, he wouldn't use it as a point of pride.

He and Ethan—

They were different.
###Chapter 399

Alexander Laurent: Believing He Could Restrain Himself

Ethan Roscente's face was dark.

He stared intently at Sebastian Evans's retreating back.

His palm slammed against the steering wheel.

A sharp horn blast tore through the night sky.

An upstairs resident shoved their window open.

"Who's honking in the middle of the night? Are you insane?"

A basin of cold water poured down.

It drenched the roof of Ethan's car.

Sebastian had long since turned and left.

His figure disappeared inside the building's entrance.

On the balcony.

Alexander Laurent took in the entire scene.

Including the moment Sebastian escorted Sophia Sullivan upstairs.

A cold wind whipped snow against his face.

But he felt no chill.

He stood there for a full half hour.

His chest felt tight and painful.

Each breath carried a heavy ache.

His thoughts were a tangled mess.

During their last test.

She had said she didn't want a relationship, only to study.

He thought he could retreat to the position of a friend.

Silently guarding her growth.

But he had overestimated his own restraint.

Some thoughts, once they take root.

Grow and spread wildly.

He began to crave.

That he would be the only man by her side.

That her gaze would always linger on him.

That her smile would only bloom for him.

He even hoped.

She would think of him as often as he thought of her.

These insane thoughts.

The moment he saw her step out of Sebastian's car.

Completely shattered his reason.

Alexander smiled bitterly.

So he could lose control like this too.

Even more pathetic.

He was the only one deeply trapped.

…

Under the same night sky.

Julian Winston wasn't faring much better.

After receiving Olivia Lopez's call.

He immediately rushed over from the nightclub.

He waited downstairs at her company for nearly an hour.

But never caught a glimpse of her.

His calls were directly hung up.

"Fuck!"

Young Master Gu cursed in anger.

He punched the steering wheel.

Grimacing in pain.

His patience had long run out.

He wanted to just drive away multiple times.

But found reasons to stay himself.

Maybe she would come down soon.

What if she couldn't answer the phone because she was busy.

Just one more minute.

Waiting five more minutes wouldn't hurt.

He'd already waited this long.

Might as well wait a little longer.

It's not like he was waiting for her.

He just wanted to see how long she could drag this out.

She better not come out tonight!

Just wait until he saw her.

He'd show her!

Sigh.

That was just Olivia Lopez for you.

Nearly midnight.

Olivia finally walked out through the revolving door.

Before Julian could feel happy.

He saw a man closely following behind her.

They walked side by side.

The man even tried to carry her bag for her.

Was this tolerable?

Then what was the point of him being her official boyfriend!

Julian pushed the car door open.

He leaned lazily against his Maybach.

Playing with his car keys.

He whistled at Olivia.

"Hey~"

Olivia turned at the sound.

Surprise flashed across her face. "What are you doing here?"

"Picking you up, why else would I be here catching the night breeze?" Julian walked forward and naturally took her bag.

The man was stunned.

His gaze fell on Julian. "Vivi, who is this?"

Clearly waiting for Olivia to introduce them.

Julian also pricked up his ears.

Anticipation hidden in his eyes.

"The eldest son of the Winston family, Julian Winston." Olivia answered offhandedly.

This answer.

Left both men dissatisfied.

"He is your?" The colleague pressed.

Julian answered directly. "Boyfriend."

"I'm her boyfriend." He emphasized again.

The colleague looked at Olivia for confirmation.

Young Master Gu laughed angrily.

He reached out and wrapped his arm around Olivia's waist.

Pulling her into his embrace.

Full of possessiveness.

Olivia cooperatively leaned against his chest.

Nodding to the male colleague. "Yes, that's right."

The male colleague left with an ugly expression.

Olivia immediately straightened up.

She slapped away his hand on her shoulder. "He's gone, you can let go now."

Julian shook his hand in pain. "Damn! That hurt!"

Olivia: "What did you expect?"

"You're still going on? Not answering your phone, not coming down, you're something else!"

"So it was you calling nonstop. Young Master Gu has so much free time?"

Julian bristled. "If you came down on time, would I have needed to call so much?"

"On time for what? Did I make plans with you?" The woman looked baffled.

Julian's eyes widened. "You said you didn't have to work overtime today!"

"I did say that, but I didn't ask you to pick me up."

She just didn't have to pull an all-nighter.

It didn't mean she could leave immediately.

She still had work to handle.

How could she possibly let Julian pick her up.

Besides, she had her own car.

The man's self-righteous attitude.

Made Olivia almost doubt her own memory.

Julian's eyes darted.

His tone weakened a little. "I... Is it wrong for me to pick you up? Even if you didn't ask, as your boyfriend, I have that much awareness!"

"With that tone and volume, you have zero awareness."

Julian was stunned for two seconds.

His voice suddenly softened. "Vivi~ Is this better~"

Olivia finally showed a smile. "Not bad."

"Alright then!" Julian opened the passenger door. "Your carriage awaits, princess~"

"No need, my car is parked up ahead."

She reached out to take her bag back.

"Don't…" Julian stopped her. "Do me a favor?"

"What?"

"Get in my car. Let's go to my place."

Olivia raised an eyebrow. "And then?"

"Let's have a go."

"…"

You shameless rogue!

Unable to withstand his persistent pestering.

Olivia finally got into the car.

He locked all the doors and windows.

The man pressed close like a large dog.
###Chapter 400

Olivia, I missed you so much!

Julian lowered his head and kissed her.

Olivia rose on her toes to respond.

She had missed him too.

Julian's hand slipped under her shirt.

Olivia stopped him.

He looked at her, confused.

Let's go home first.

Julian floored the accelerator.

Ten minutes later, the apartment door closed.

They were locked in a passionate kiss.

Clothes were scattered across the floor.

An hour later, Olivia walked into the bathroom.

Julian leaned against the headboard.

What are you doing?

Taking a shower.

Don't. Stay a little longer.

I'm all sweaty.

You smell good even when you sweat.

It's your sweat.

Julian fell silent.

Olivia changed her clothes and picked up her bag.

Julian sat up abruptly.

You're leaving?

Work tomorrow. I need a change of clothes.

What do you take me for? Julian's voice was low.

Olivia turned and raised an eyebrow.

Julian moved closer.

You sleep with me and just leave? Is my home a hotel? Am I a gigolo?

I'm not...

Bullshit! Are you just using me?

He kicked over the ottoman.

A loud crash echoed.

Olivia's face turned cold.

Who do you think you are?

Julian was stunned.

If you think you're a gigolo, I'm not paying.

Julian trembled with anger.

We agreed to pretend to be a couple, but we're actually fuckbuddies. Don't you understand that, Julian?

Free and easy, no strings attached. That was the agreement.

It was the first time a woman had ever talked to Julian like this.

I just wanted to spend more time with you. Was that necessary?

You were the one who yelled at me first. Olivia snorted.

I...

Julian deflated.

I was wrong. Couldn't you just explain?

Didn't I try?

Would you have listened when you were angry?

Okay, I'm sorry, baby~ I was wrong~

It was your fault to begin with.

Olivia snapped her fingers.

Was it worth yelling over something so small?

I'm sorry, baby~ I was wrong~

Olivia glanced at the ottoman.

Julian hurried to set it upright.

Can you stay a little longer now?

He pulled her back toward the bed.

Five minutes later.

Vivi~

Don't talk.

Again.

Olivia was speechless.

3 a.m. It started to rain.

Let me borrow your car. Olivia checked her mirror.

The hickey was obvious.

Be more careful next time.

Got someone to answer to? Julian chuckled.

Must you always say the wrong thing?

No... It just happens in the heat of the moment. My back is covered in your scratches.

Olivia was at a loss for words.

The scratches were deep.

Ahem! Yours can be covered. Mine are obvious.

Call in sick and spend the day with me.

Keep the pot on the stove for you? Dream on!

That's not what I meant. Car keys.

Julian tossed her the BMW keys.

Olivia threw them back.

I want the Maybach.

Come over tomorrow night.

Olivia looked him over.

Don't push yourself.

What's that supposed to mean? How am I pushing myself? Explain!

Don't argue with a man who's losing it.

Olivia picked up the keys and left.

Julian punched the bed.

Who's losing it? You're the one losing it!

The door closed with a soft click.

She knows exactly how to push his buttons.

...

Sophia Sullivan spent her day off with her parents.

She brought back a pile of gifts.

The next day, she returned to the lab.

Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence were also there.

See? I told you Sophia would be here today!

What are you guys doing here?

The project wrapped up. Taking a couple days off.

Sophia was organizing materials ahead of schedule.

Weren't you going on a trip nearby?
###Chapter 401

Hannah Morse jumped up excitedly.

"We're done with the trip!"

Sophia Sullivan was slightly taken aback.

"So soon?"

Hannah shook her head.

"It was just a short trip nearby. One day is plenty."

Sophia looked toward Marcus Lawrence.

She remembered his itinerary was for three days and two nights.

It was packed with activities.

Ending in one day?

Something felt off.

Sophia was about to speak.

Marcus suddenly coughed twice.

"Right, a one-day trip. As long as we had fun."

Hannah moved closer to Sophia.

"Sophia, his backpack was even bigger than mine!"

Marcus's expression stiffened.

"He wouldn't say what was inside."

"Didn't use it during the trip either."

"Carried that huge bag all the way up the Great Wall. Seriously impressive!"

Marcus silently turned away.

Thanks for that.

Sophia's gaze turned knowing.

She could guess what was in the bag.

A three-day trip required changes of clothes.

Seemed Hannah didn't know the original plan.

Marcus cleared his throat softly.

Please don't expose me.

Sophia nodded in understanding.

Got it.

Only Hannah remained blissfully cheerful.

"Sophia, taking a day to rest before playing was amazing!"

"Slept right until noon, then headed out…"

Sophia raised an eyebrow.

So they didn't even get a full day of activities?

Hannah pouted.

"Marcus kept rushing me out the door."

"Life is about being happy."

"Who says you have to leave at a specific time?"

"My dark circles are gone thanks to sleeping in."

"All that late-night work was making my eyes look smaller."

Marcus glanced at her.

"Weren't your eyes always like that?"

"I don't see any difference."

Hannah immediately put her hands on her hips and glared.

"Marcus Lawrence! Don't make me hit you!"

Marcus quickly backed away.

Retreating.

The three began discussing their project proposal.

Though Hannah and Marcus loved to fool around.

They were exceptionally serious about work.

Play was play.

Academics were another matter.

Their efficiency was high.

They finished by four in the afternoon.

Hannah let out a long sigh.

She leaned back in her chair and stretched.

"That was fast."

"Just hungry now."

She went to the break area to dig for snacks.

They had only had a quick takeout lunch.

She was starving now.

She pulled out a bag of chips from the cabinet.

Marcus returned from the restroom.

He hurried to stop her.

"Don't eat that!"

Hannah was startled by how quickly he returned.

Do guys always finish that fast?

Marcus rushed over and snatched the chips away.

Hannah had already stuffed a handful into her mouth.

Marcus sighed helplessly.

He'd never seen someone so snack-obsessed.

Hannah looked smug.

Heh.

A little proud.

"Add two extra kilometers to your run tomorrow morning."

Hannah's face instantly fell.

Sophia couldn't help but laugh.

When she finally stopped, she spoke.

"Everyone's been working hard lately."

"I booked a private room at Le Goût Authentique."

"Reserved their signature Lotus Leaf Wrapped Chicken too."

"Let's pack up and head out."

Hannah forgot all about running at the mention of good food.

She rushed over and hugged Sophia.

"You're the best, Sophia!"

"How did you know I was craving that chicken?"

Sophia patted her with a smile.

"You mentioned it before. I remembered."

"I was curious what all the fuss was about."

"To have you thinking about it for so long."

Hannah was full of confidence.

"You won't be disappointed!"

"Their flavor is incredible!"

A foodie's intuition was rarely wrong.

Hannah's recommendations almost never missed.

The head chef at Le Goût Authentique was from the Huaiyang region.

His Lotus Leaf Wrapped Chicken was legendary.

He had also adapted it to local tastes.

Fragrant, tender, and delicious.

The chicken was incredibly moist.

Infused with the subtle scent of lotus leaves.

Just thinking about it made her mouth water.

Lately, to maintain her morning run results.

Marcus strictly controlled her diet.

Every day was bland and boring.

Hannah felt like she was growing fur on her tongue.

Though she sneaked snacks at night.

But snacks were no match for a proper feast.

"Sophia, I love you~"

Finally, she could properly feed her stomach.

Hannah was moved nearly to tears.

Marcus raised an eyebrow.

"Did I starve you or something?"

"Then cancel the morning runs."

Marcus crossed his arms.

"Fine."

"Don't blame me if next year's physical shows Fatty Liver Disease again."

Hannah immediately shut her mouth.

Forget it. She'd endure for her health.

She wasn't ungrateful.

Marcus came to wake her up before dawn every day.

The winter was so cold.

His face was often red from the chill.

While she was still cozy under the covers.

The thought made her feel guilty.

Her own father wouldn't go that far.

Marcus was a really good guy.

A keeper!

Sophia, sipping tea, overheard the conversation.

She couldn't help but spit out her laugh.

Choking until her face turned red.

"Cough cough…"

Hannah quickly waved her hands.

"I was joking. Don't cancel it."

She looked at Marcus pleadingly.

"Can I eat my fill tonight?"

Marcus pressed his lips together.

"Marcus?"

"... Eighty percent full."

"Deal!"

He wouldn't know if she ate to ninety percent.

Hehe~

The happiness from good food was indescribable.

A flicker of amusement passed through Marcus's eyes.

His real expectation was ninety percent full.

He said eighty to give her bargaining room.

She was probably secretly celebrating now.

Le Goût Authentique.

The dishes had just been served when they arrived.

Steaming hot.

Without further ado, they started eating.

Hannah finished half the Lotus Leaf Wrapped Chicken.

Marcus silently placed a chicken drumstick on her plate.

Hannah's eyes instantly lit up.

"Marcus, you're so good."

Marcus sighed softly.

Sigh.
###Chapter 402

Hannah finished the last bite of her chicken leg.
She let out a satisfied burp.

"This is the life! I just want to be a food scientist, researching delicious things every day!"

Her eyes sparkled.
Grease still smudged the corner of her mouth.

Sophia Sullivan handed her a napkin.

Hannah wiped her mouth while leaning in curiously.
"Sophia, what's your dream? What kind of person do you want to become?"

Sophia paused slightly.

She looked out the window, thinking for a few seconds.

"The research I'm doing now is what I want to do. As for what kind of person..."

Her voice was soft.
"Probably someone like Professor Eleanor Watson."

Hannah immediately frowned.
"The Professor is amazing, but it always feels like she's too lonely."

Eleanor Watson never married, dedicating all her time to the lab.

There was no right or wrong in that choice.
But seeing the Professor's solitary figure during her illness was inevitably heartbreaking.

Sophia smiled.
"I asked her once if she regretted her choice."

Hannah sat up straight.
"What did she say?"

Even Marcus Lawrence put down his chopsticks to listen.

Sophia's gaze grew distant.
"She said life is rarely perfect. There are always trade-offs. Since energy is finite, she'd rather pour all of it into research. For her, that is perfection."

Even if she lost other things, at least she held onto what she wanted most.

Hannah muttered quietly.
"Isn't that a bit extreme?"

Sophia shook her head.
"Everyone has different pursuits. As long as it's your own choice and you can see it through, that is perfection."

"Then, Sophia, will you get married?"

The question came suddenly.
Sophia was stunned for two seconds.

Then she laughed softly.
"If I meet the right person, I probably will."

She wasn't opposed to marriage.
She just hadn't met the right one.

After breaking up with Ethan Roscente, she had closed herself off for a while.

But time eventually heals all wounds.

True moving on means being able to face the past calmly, and not fearing the future.

Hannah turned to look at Marcus.
"Little Marcus, what about you?"

Marcus adjusted his glasses.
"Do research. Pure research."

Before, he thought sports were pure, so he trained in sprinting.

Later, he thought studying was pure, so he focused on his books.

Now, research seemed good too, so he would keep walking that path.

Hannah clicked her tongue in amazement.
"Is that 'love the one you're with'? But what does 'pure' mean?"

Marcus replied.
"It means focus. Uninterrupted."

"How can you be completely uninterrupted?" Hannah pouted.
"My Pops and I have been collecting rent for years. We've seen all sorts of people. Nothing is truly pure."

Marcus was silent for a moment.

"You're right. Nothing is absolutely pure. As dialectical materialism says, all things are interconnected..."

Hannah quickly interrupted.
"Stop! I think you should study philosophy!"

Marcus sighed.
"...Just eat your chicken leg."

"You said it!" Hannah happily picked up another chicken leg.

Marcus shook his head helplessly.

...

After the meal, Sophia paid the bill.

The three of them strolled along the street to walk off the meal.

"We live close by. Let's walk to the main gate and get a cab? It's on the way and saves money!"

Marcus raised an eyebrow.
"Aren't you a little rich girl? Worried about a few dollars?"

She had casually offered to gift a million-dollar car before.
Now she wanted to save ten dollars on a cab.

Hannah said righteously.
"Having money doesn't mean you should waste it! My Pops says save where you should, spend where you should. No wasting!"

Sophia chuckled.
"She's right."

"Just like Sophia. She spent so much building the lab but lives simply herself. That's a smart person!"

Marcus nodded repeatedly.
"I'm learning."

Hannah lifted her chin proudly.
"Little Marcus, you still have a lot to learn!"

...

Suddenly, Marcus stopped walking.

Hannah's smile froze.

Sophia followed their gaze and raised an eyebrow.

A bright yellow Ferrari was parked at the MIT main gate.

The flashy color and cool model made it impossible to ignore.

A man leaned against the car.

It was Ethan Roscente.

Fortunately, it was winter break.
Not many people were at the gate, so it didn't cause a scene.

Sophia frowned.
"Fiona Valentine hasn't left campus yet?"

Hannah pouted.
"Professor Victoria Lowell demanded all grad students stay. They're not allowed to leave until just before New Year's."

"Isn't the lab under renovation? What are they staying for?"

Hannah rolled her eyes.
"Who knows? She's miserable and doesn't want her students to be happy either."

Marcus spoke calmly.
"You can say that because you have the leverage."

Hannah grinned.

Like Amelia Roscente.
She had long since gone home and hadn't returned to school.

Ashley Lowell had submitted the project report for her.

She got the second author credit for free.

Hannah sighed.
"Jude Granger is so pitiful..."

Marcus suddenly turned to her.
"Are you close with him?"
###Chapter 403

Hannah Morse blinked.
"Not that familiar, really."
"I just think he's a decent guy."
"At the botanical garden that day, everyone else just stood by and watched."
"Only he stepped in to help."
"I've always remembered that."

Marcus Lawrence let out a soft, derisive sound.
"You have quite the memory."

"?"

"Everyone is a 'decent guy' in your eyes."
"Do you just love complimenting people that much?"

Hannah's eyes widened.
"Are you feeling okay?"

"..."

Not far away, Ethan Roscente leaned against his sports car.
He checked his watch repeatedly.

Clearly waiting for someone.

He didn't have to wait long.
The person he was waiting for appeared.

Fiona Valentine came jogging over, her cheeks flushed, slightly out of breath.
To see Ethan, she had deliberately skipped the heavy down coat.
She wore a fitted overcoat that perfectly outlined her figure.
Her usually loose hair was tied up in a neat bun today.
A pearl hair clip added a touch of清爽 elegance.

"Have you been waiting long?"
"Sorry, I forgot my scarf on the way out and had to go back for it."

Ethan didn't respond.
His expression was blank, somewhat distracted.
His gaze drifted, almost imperceptibly, in another direction.

Fiona followed his line of sight.
Understanding dawned as soon as she saw Sophia Sullivan.

Of course.
That's why.
Otherwise, why would Ethan suddenly ask to meet her?
And insist on meeting right at the school gate?
It certainly wasn't because he missed her.

Hah...
Since the stage was set—
Let her start the show.

Fiona clenched her fists.
She took a deep breath, then slowly relaxed.
A bright smile spread across her face as she主动 walked towards Sophia.

"What a coincidence, Sophia!"
"Didn't expect to run into you here."

Sophia offered a slight smile.
"It's not just me you've run into."

Fiona's smile faltered, as if she'd just noticed Marcus and Hannah.
"You're here too!"
"What a small world."

Hannah tilted her head.
"Fiona, you say that like we just popped out of nowhere?"
"Marcus and I have been standing right next to Sophia this whole time."
"How could you not see us?"

"My apologies, perhaps I just didn't notice…"

"Wow," Hannah sighed dramatically.
"I'm standing right here, a whole person, and you didn't see me?"
"You must be really focused on my friend Sophia."
"Does she just suck up all your attention the moment she appears?"

Fiona gave an awkward laugh.
"...Really, I'm sorry."

"It's fine."
"I don't mind."

Ethan chose that moment to step forward.
He naturally slid an arm around Fiona's waist.
His eyes calmly met Sophia's.
"We meet again."

Sophia gave a faint nod.
Even more distant than her response to Fiona.

Ethan either didn't notice or chose to ignore it.
He continued casually.
"Saw Sebastian's post yesterday."
"The Atlantes are back from abroad?"

"Yes."

"So you were there yesterday?" His tone was deliberately light, but his eyes sharpened.

Sophia didn't answer.
Her silence was confirmation enough.

"You actually went with him to see the Atlantes?!"

Sophia glanced at Fiona, a slight frown forming.
"Mr. Roscente."
"Mind your position."

Position?
What position?
The position of Fiona's boyfriend, of course!
These were not questions he should be asking.
And she had no obligation to answer.

Ethan's fists clenched.
A dull roar filled his ears.
He wanted to shout, to demand why Sebastian was allowed when he wasn't?
Weren't they both just as flawed?
No, Sebastian was even worse!
Why would she choose Sebastian over coming back to him?

"Ethan, are you alright?" Fiona asked softly.

Ethan snapped back to reality.
He forced down the questions and the frustration.
He couldn't lose his composure.
He'd played this role for so long; he had to keep playing it.
If he revealed his true intentions, Sophia would avoid him like the plague.
He might not even get a chance to see her calmly like this again.

But Fiona could feel it.
After Sophia's words, half of his soul seemed to have left him.

Sophia turned to Hannah and Marcus.
"It's getting late."
"Shall we head back?"

"Yeah!" Hannah nodded immediately.
"It's almost nine."
"Let's go, it's freezing out here…"

She rubbed her hands together and blew on them for warmth.
She was genuinely impressed by Ethan.
It was below freezing, yet he stood by his sports car on the roadside, trying to look cool.
Even if he was waiting for someone, couldn't he wait inside the car?
Did he have to lean against it and pose?
Wasn't he cold?
Tsk...
She really didn't understand the thought process of these arrogant CEOs.

"We're off now, Fiona, and Fiona's boyfriend."
"Enjoy your date."
"Bye~"

Fiona's boyfriend?
Hannah really knew how to twist the knife.

Ethan: "..."

He watched as Sophia got into the taxi.
He didn't look away until the car's taillights disappeared from view.
Then he withdrew his arm from around Fiona's waist.

Fiona saw it all.
Though her heart ached, she maintained her smile on the surface.
No matter how bitter, she had to smile.
Because—
This was her role.
From the very beginning, their arrangement was clear: he paid, and she acted.
She didn't dare show a hint of jealousy in front of Ethan.
She had to deceive Ethan, just as he was trying to deceive Sophia.
It was bitterly ironic and laughable.

With Sophia gone, Ethan had no reason to stay.
He turned to get into his car.

Suddenly—

Fiona spoke up.
"I got all dressed up, came to the school gate late at night, and acted in this little play with you."
"Are you just going to leave without even a thank you?"

Her tone was playful, light and charming.

"Thank you," Ethan said, already pulling the car door open.

Fiona gave a helpless smile.
"Is a simple 'thank you' really enough?"
"Couldn't you... maybe buy me dinner?"
"Alright, I admit it, I'm hungry."
"My roommate's gone home, I'm all alone in the dorm."
"Could you join me for a late snack?"
"My treat."

Ethan raised an eyebrow.
"Not necessary."

Fiona's eyes dropped, disappointed, but she quickly smiled again.
"Okay then. Drive safe, I'll head back—"

Ethan cut in.
"I meant, no need for you to pay."

Fiona: "!"

"Get in."

A triumphant smile flickered across the woman's lips, quickly replaced by an expression of sweet naivety.

...

The place was Fiona's choice.
A roadside stall on a snack street.
Highly recommended by influencers, a popular though humble little eatery.

The stall was crowded with young people.
The moment Ethan approached, his attire and appearance made him stand out starkly.
He drew looks from other patrons.
He felt uncomfortable but showed no sign of it on his face.

Fiona wiped a small stool with a tissue and offered it to him.
"Have a seat."

Ethan glanced at it, his brow twitching almost imperceptibly.
He sat down.

Fiona asked, "What would you like?"
"Their grilled skewers are famous, especially the grilled gluten and the grilled intestines..."

Ethan interrupted.
"You decide."
###Chapter 404

Fiona Valentine tapped the menu with her fingertip.
"Shall I order then?"

"Hmm."

"Madam, we'll have..."

She recited the dishes with practiced ease, clearly a regular.

"...Trust me, the flavors here are incredible. Rivals any high-end restaurant!"

Her eyes sparkled as she enthusiastically recommended.

Ethan Roscente gave occasional, terse replies, his demeanor cold.

The smoky aroma of barbecue tightened his throat.
The surrounding cacophony of voices only amplified his irritation.
He glanced at the skewers placed before him and lost his appetite completely.

Back when he dated Sophia Sullivan, even street food stalls felt enjoyable.
It turned out the wrong person made everything feel wrong.

Fiona picked up a skewer and offered it to him.
"Try this one. It's my favorite."

Ethan didn't take it.

Her hand paused mid-air.
"You don't like this kind of food, do you? My apologies, I wasn't considerate."
She quickly set the skewer down, her tone flustered.
"Should we go somewhere else? You choose."

"No need. My stomach's been unsettled lately. Not hungry."

"But we ordered so much..."

Ethan had lost all patience.
"Throw away whatever's left."

Fiona only ate a few skewers in the end, leaving the rest untouched.

The owner sighed while settling the bill, seeing the table full of leftovers.
"Young people these days... if you can't finish it, don't order so much. Having money doesn't mean you should waste food..."

Ethan drove Fiona back to campus in silence.
He only gave short answers when she initiated conversation.

Eventually, even she fell quiet.

The atmosphere in the car grew stiff.

Ethan focused on driving, seemingly oblivious.

Fiona gazed out the window at the streets rushing past, her eyes gradually losing focus.

Passing the bar street, she suddenly spoke.
"It's still early. Fancy a drink?"

Ethan didn't answer, but slowly pulled over.

He led her into a bar named "L'Air du Temps".

"Mr. Roscente! What a rare guest! Thought my eyes were deceiving me! The usual? A bottle of Brandy and Louis XIII?"

The owner greeted him warmly.

Considering Fiona's tolerance, Ethan just ordered a bottle of Champagne and headed straight for a booth.

Fiona followed closely behind.

The owner watched them with a knowing smile.

The manager murmured, "Hasn't the young master been gone for over a year? Heard he was heartbroken, moped for ages."

The owner shot him a glance.
"Can't believe rumors! See, he's brought a new flame."

The manager chuckled.
"Guys like him never settle for just one person."

"Take good care of them tonight. He's a major client."

...

The classic Champagne was crisp and slightly acidic, more palatable chilled.

Accustomed to hard liquor, Ethan found it too mild, only taking occasional sips.

Fiona, however, seemed to have discovered a new world, downing three glasses and reaching for more.

Ethan reminded her flatly.
"Champagne can still get you drunk."

"Really? It tastes like juice, with a hint of peach." Her cheeks flushed, her watery eyes gazing at him dreamily.
"You don't like it?"

Ethan neither confirmed nor denied.

Unbothered, Fiona poured herself another glass.

The change of scenery and the music seemed to soften the man's expression, his mood apparently improving.
He even responded when Fiona spoke.

It was no longer a monologue.

Suddenly, the beat grew stronger, the lights shifted dazzlingly, and couples on the dance floor moved freely to the music.

Fiona's eyes lit up, caught by the atmosphere. She took Ethan's hand.
"Let's go dance?"

Tipsy, her gaze was hazy yet strikingly bright as she pleaded softly. A flicker of thought crossed Ethan's mind, and he let her pull him onto the dance floor.

Fiona didn't know how to dance, just swayed randomly to the music. Her clumsiness amused Ethan.

"What are you laughing at?" she mumbled.

His smile widened.

Annoyed, she said, "Don't just let me make a fool of myself. You dance too!"

Emboldened by alcohol, Fiona boldly grabbed his hands and swung them wildly.

Seeing he didn't resist, she grew bolder, raising his hands and spinning.

Ethan wasn't particularly interested, but he didn't stop her either.

Fiona moved from nervousness to immersion, until their eyes met—

The lights were seductive, the music intimate.

Somehow their bodies drew close. The faint scent of alcohol on him made Fiona feel even drunker.

Looking up, her heartbeat suddenly raced. Ethan's eyes seemed to hold a galaxy of stars, pulling her inexorably closer...

She rose on her toes, her gaze settling on his lips.

The music was perfect, the atmosphere heating up.

The man seemed equally captivated, leaning in slowly.

Just as Fiona's heart pounded, thinking she was about to succeed, Ethan suddenly pushed her away, stepping back two paces.

"You're drunk."

Fiona stiffened.

She quickly lowered her eyes to hide her disappointment.

When she looked up again, her expression was one of confused embarrassment. She patted her cheeks, her eyes clearing as she apologized repeatedly.
"I'm sorry. I had too much to drink. I wasn't thinking straight."

Ethan let out a soft laugh, neither agreeing nor disagreeing, and turned to leave the dance floor.

He paid the bill and strode out of the bar.

Fiona watched his retreating back, furious and frustrated. She clenched her fists, bit her lip, and chased after him.

She refused to believe there was a fortress in this world that couldn't be breached.

If there was, it was either the wrong method or insufficient patience.

Fortunately, she lacked neither.

Could Ethan evade her once and evade her every time?

Men were all the same, after all.
###Chapter 405

Early Sunday morning.

Sebastian Evans's car was parked downstairs.

He was taking Sophia Sullivan to the Atlante residence today.

The old couple had been talking about wanting to meet their grandson's girlfriend for a while now.

They had called to urge him several times.

Sophia did not refuse.

The elderly couple had been genuinely kind to her.

She got up early to prepare.

She even baked low-sugar almond cookies.

She planned to let the elderly couple try them.

Exactly eight o'clock.

Sebastian knocked on the door punctually.

He changed his shoes and entered.

His first question was,

"Have you had breakfast yet?"

Sophia was taken aback.

"Not yet."

"Perfect timing."

He walked naturally towards the kitchen.

"Is there enough for me?"

Sophia nodded.

"I made wonton soup."

"You made them yourself?"

"Yes."

Sebastian took a bite.

His eyes lit up slightly.

"It tastes very good."

Sophia's lips curved into a smile.

Who doesn't like being praised?

As they were leaving.

Sebastian proactively picked up the box of pastries.

Sophia suddenly remembered something.

"Wait a moment."

She quickly walked to the balcony.

Moved a few pots of succulents to a shady spot.

And closed the windows.

"Okay, we can go now."

Sebastian nodded.

The door across the hall suddenly opened.

Alexander Laurent walked out.

The three of them ran into each other.

Sophia smiled and greeted him.

"Good morning, Professor."

Sebastian raised an eyebrow.

"We always seem to run into each other."

"What a coincidence."

Alexander's gaze focused slightly.

He noticed Sophia was still in her loungewear.

Yet Sebastian was already inside her apartment.

She used to be very resistant to this before.

But now...

His knuckles tightened slightly.

His tone remained calm.

"Going out?"

Sebastian nodded.

"To my grandparents' place."

Alexander looked at Sophia.

"Do you need a ride?"

Sophia shook her head.

"No need to trouble you."

"Sebastian will drive."

Alexander's breath hitched.

Sebastian.

She said it so naturally.

Sebastian bid a polite farewell.

"We should get going now."

"The elderly are waiting."

Sophia waved.

"Goodbye, Professor."

Alexander stood where he was.

Watching the two walk away side by side.

His eyes were dark and unreadable.

......

In the laboratory.

Alexander silently checked data.

Professor Quincy Evans sipped soy milk through a straw and came over.

"Yo, you're here early."

Alexander ignored him.

Quincy glanced at the screen.

"Hasn't this data already been checked?"

"You're off your game today."

Alexander remained silent.

Quincy narrowed his eyes.

"Let me guess."

"You're definitely in a bad mood."

"..."

"The research project is fine."

"Nothing's wrong at home either."

"So it must be a matter of the heart!"

Alexander's movements paused.

Quincy jumped up.

"I knew it!"

"Is it because of little Sophia?"

Alexander looked up.

"Don't talk nonsense."

"Stop pretending."

Quincy pursed his lips.

"You think I can't see what's on your mind?"

Alexander frowned.

"Watch your words."

"She still has to focus on her studies."

Quincy shrugged.

"Relax."

"I know my limits."

"I won't say anything out of line."

Alexander's expression softened slightly.

Quincy leaned in closer.

"Can you tell me now?"

"..."

"Did you two have a fight?"

Alexander shook his head.

"No."

"Then is she giving you the cold shoulder?"

"Not that either."

Quincy clapped his hands.

"I get it now!"

"There's a love rival!"

Alexander pressed his lips together.

"Stop making wild guesses."

"Who's making wild guesses?"

Quincy raised an eyebrow.

"Your reaction makes it obvious."

"Alex."

He said with deep feeling.

"If you like her, go after her."

"If you keep dragging your feet, she'll be gone."

Alexander's heart clenched.

"I tried."

Quincy's eyes widened.

"You really went for it?"

"When?"

Alexander turned his face away.

"She said her studies come first."

Quincy stamped his foot.

"Oh no!"

"That's a gentle rejection!"

Alexander insisted.

"She was telling the truth."

Quincy sighed.

"Then who is she close to now?"

Alexander was silent.

"Can't bring yourself to say it?"

"It's not about being close."

Quincy was puzzled.

"Then what is it?"

"It's just that she's suddenly become very... particular towards someone."

Just who is Sebastian Evans?

Why does he get to be the exception for her?
###Chapter 406

A knowing smile touched Quincy Evans's lips.

"Still claiming you don't have feelings for Sophia? Your reaction just gave you away."

"..."

"If you have doubts, just ask her directly. A man should be straightforward. You know Sophia dislikes beating around the bush."

Alexander Laurent's gaze flickered slightly.

"Stop dawdling! Keep hesitating and your future wife really will run off with someone else! I doubt you can focus on work until you sort this out."

"Who says I'm not focused?"

"Hah, you even miscalculated the baseline data. Still claim you're focused?" Quincy pointed to a spot on the screen. "You're just stubborn."

Alexander scanned the screen, a flicker of embarrassment in his eyes.

Quincy clapped him on the shoulder. "Good luck, brother!"

He then turned and walked toward the lab bench.

"When did you notice?" Alexander asked suddenly.

Quincy paused, turning back with a smile. "The way you look at Sophia. The exceptions you keep making for her. Even your tone is gentler with her. It's obvious. You think I'm blind?"

Alexander's expression stiffened slightly. "That obvious?"

"What do you think?"

"What are you talking about? Can I listen?" Lillian Lopez approached with a smile.

Alexander immediately schooled his features, shooting Quincy a warning glance.

Quincy faced Lillian, but behind his back, he gave Alexander a quick 'OK' sign.

Lillian smiled. "Professor Evans, what secret project can't even I hear about?"

Her words were for Quincy, but her sidelong glance went to Alexander.

Quincy shook his head with feigned seriousness. "Lillian, since it's a secret, of course I can't just tell you…"

He then turned and walked off, hands clasped behind his back.

He couldn't miss the look in Alexander's eyes, and he understood Lillian's intentions perfectly.

"Professor Evans, morning!" Simon Lowell walked towards them, holding two breakfast bags.

Tsk tsk...

"Morning, Simon. Thanks for your hard work."

Simon: ?

The lab hadn't been busy lately. No one was working overtime. What hard work?

...

Night deepened. Alexander went home early.

Standing below the apartment building, he looked up at Sophia Sullivan's window.

It was dark. She wasn't home yet.

He turned and went upstairs. After entering his apartment, he opened the refrigerator but lost all interest in cooking.

He just made a cup of hot tea and went into his study.

He opened his laptop and pulled up his unfinished thesis, starting to work.

Half an hour later, he checked the time.

Another half hour passed. There was still no movement next door.

He closed the document and tiredly rubbed the bridge of his nose.

Picking up his cup, he found it empty. He stood up to get water in the living room.

As he drank his tea, his gaze unconsciously swept over the wall clock. The hour hand already pointed to ten.

So late, and she still wasn't back…

Suddenly, the sound of an engine came from outside the window.

Alexander immediately walked to the balcony. Sure enough, he saw Sebastian Evans's car parked at the mouth of the alley.

Sophia got out of the car. Sebastian also got out from the driver's side. They were talking.

"Let me walk you up."

Sophia shook her head. "No need, I didn't bring much today. It's late, and you have work tomorrow. You should go back and rest early."

"Alright." Sebastian didn't insist.

"I'll go up then."

"Sophia, wait—"

"Yes?" She turned, her gaze questioning.

Sebastian was momentarily stunned. Under the streetlight, her look was focused and pure, but it wasn't the way a woman looks at a man.

"Grandmother said she was very happy today. She hopes you can visit often when you have time."

"Okay."

Sophia turned and entered the building. Sebastian watched her shadow until it disappeared.

Only after the light turned on in Sophia's apartment did he get back in his car and leave.

Sophia had spent the day with the elderly couple, eating, chatting, playing chess, and fishing.

Sebastian had accompanied them the whole time.

She had indeed enjoyed herself, but the late hour brought inevitable fatigue.

She took a shower first thing after getting home. She was about to dry her hair and go to sleep when she suddenly heard a knock.

"Who is it?"

"It's me." Alexander Laurent's voice.

Sophia quickly wrapped her wet hair and ran to open the door. "Professor?!"

She was surprised to see him.

Alexander rarely came to see her so late.

In his view, knocking on a woman's door late at night was very impolite.

So… was something urgent wrong?

When the door opened, seeing Sophia in her pajamas with her hair wrapped, a look of regret flashed in Alexander's eyes.

"Sorry for disturbing your rest."

"Professor—" Sophia called out to him, smiling. "No disturbance at all. Please, come in."

The man was silent for a moment.

He finally entered,changing into his slippers.

Only…

Next to the pair he usually wore, there was a new pair of slippers.

His gaze darkened.

He didn't need to ask to know they were Sebastian's.

"Professor, please have a seat. I just need to dry my hair. Ten minutes."

"Mm, dry your hair first. Don't catch a cold."

Sophia had originally planned to dry her hair in the bathroom, but it was still full of steam from her shower.

She usually dried it in the living room. This time, she decided to do it in her bedroom.

She unplugged the dryer and was about to walk inside when Alexander suddenly stopped her.

"Dry your hair here in the living room. I'll go check on the plants on the balcony."

He stood up and walked towards the balcony.

A warmth spread through Sophia's heart. Watching the man's back, an indescribable softness bloomed in her chest.

It felt like being包容, being accommodated, being cared for at every moment.

She had only ever felt this way from her father before.

"Professor, the few pots on the left haven't been watered in a week. Could you please help me water them?"

"Okay."

Ten minutes later—

Sophia put away the hair dryer and walked to the balcony. "Professor? Finished?"

Alexander stood up. "Finished."

He hadn't just watered them. He had also weeded.

He had even tended to the pots on the right.

Sophia: "Thank you. Come in quickly, it's cold outside."

"Okay."

Alexander went to wash his hands. When he came out of the bathroom, he found Sophia sitting on the sofa, looking at him.

Her small face was faintly pink. Her hair was down, not completely dry yet, still slightly damp but exceptionally soft.

Her eyes were dark and bright, sparkling under the light. The moment her gaze met his, Alexander froze completely.

His Adam's apple bobbed slightly, his voice a bit hoarse. "...What is it?"

Sophia: "Professor, did you need something?"

Alexander looked down. He walked to the sofa and took a stack of materials from his bag.

He had indeed been carrying a bag when he came in.

"Last time, your father mentioned wanting to find interdisciplinary papers on biological genetics and physics. It's a relatively niche field. There aren't many research成果. It took some time to find them. I just finished compiling them today. Could you pass them on to him for me?"

Sophia was stunned. "Professor, you're so busy, yet you still found time to look up papers for my dad? No, I need to talk to him tomorrow. If he has questions, he should solve them himself or ask me. He can't keep troubling you like this."

"It's no trouble. I have access to more paper resources. Your father is eager to learn. If he could find them himself, he wouldn't have asked me. Don't worry about it. This is between your father and me. Let's keep our relationships separate."

"This…" Sophia took the materials, thanking him earnestly.

Alexander didn't leave immediately. He hesitated for two seconds before suddenly asking, "Do you have any food at home?"

Sophia: "??"
###Chapter 407

Alexander Laurent gave a light cough.
The tips of his ears were slightly red.
"...Haven't had dinner yet."

Sophia Sullivan held back her laughter.
She was afraid he would become even more flustered.
"Noodles okay?"

Alexander nodded.
"Sorry to trouble you."

She turned and walked into the kitchen.
Besides noodles, she fried a golden egg.
She blanched some vibrant green baby bok choy.
She sliced over ten pieces of homemade braised beef.
She laid them thickly on top of the noodles.
Finally, she sprinkled chopped scallions and cilantro.

A steaming bowl of noodles was placed on the table.
"Professor, it's ready."

Alexander sat down and began to eat.
He ate quickly and eagerly.
Yet he still maintained an air of elegance.

Sophia rested her chin in her hands and watched him.
She hadn't expected him to look so good even while eating noodles.
Each bite was taken with serious focus.
As if he were savoring a top-tier gourmet meal.

He suddenly looked up.
His eyes met hers.
"Why are you staring at me?"

"Watching how much you're enjoying it
lets me know if my cooking is good."

Alexander's ears turned even redder.
"...Excuse my manners."

"This is a compliment to me."
A cook loves nothing more than seeing a diner enjoy their food.

Alexander said solemnly, "It's very delicious."

Sophia's eyes curved into crescents.
"Glad you like it.
Has the lab been very busy lately?"

You didn't even have time for dinner.

Alexander paused.
"About the same as usual.
Just didn't feel like cooking for myself.
And it never turns out tasty anyway..."

Truth was, his palate had been spoiled by her cooking.

Halfway through the meal, he suddenly asked, "Do you have any beer?"

Sophia was stunned.
Usually, she was the one asking if he wanted a drink.
He always refused.
Today he was actually asking for it himself?

He really did seem different tonight.

She took two cans of beer from the refrigerator.
"Here you go."

Alexander looked at her. "Aren't you having any?"

Sophia shook her head.
"I'll just have a small glass."

She brought a small glass tumbler.
She pushed it toward him.
"Professor, you're not going to be stingy, are you?"

Alexander gave a soft laugh.
"Wouldn't dream of being stingy with you."

He poured her a glass.
"Enough?"

"Plenty."

The cold beer went down.
Sophia gave a slight shiver.

Alexander watched her.
Then he took a large swig himself.

The noodles were finished.
The soup was drunk clean.
The two cans of beer were soon empty.

The slightly tipsy Professor Laurent became more talkative.
He stared at the empty beer can.
As if it had flowers painted on it.

"...Did you have fun at the Atlante house today?"

Sophia nodded.
"Mrs. Atlante made a whole table of delicious food.
There were desserts in the afternoon too.
I went fishing and picked mulberries with the elderly couple.
We were originally going to see an art exhibition too..."

Alexander asked casually, "Was Sebastian Evans there too?"

"Yes."

Alexander clenched his fist under the table.
His voice was hoarse.
"What do you think of him?"

Sophia thought about it.
"My impression wasn't good before.
But now I think he's quite alright."

Alexander's breath hitched.
A dull ache spread through his heart.

Just as he was about to ask that question, Sophia added, "He's a good older brother."

"Brother?" Alexander was dumbfounded.

"He's my cousin.
Didn't I tell you?"

The man shook his head blankly.

"I was too busy recently and forgot to mention it.
Mom has been recognized by the Atlante family."

She briefly explained the whole story.
"So Sebastian Evans is my cousin."

Alexander was still processing it.
"...He's your cousin?"

"Right," Sophia asked with a laugh.
"Any other questions?"

Alexander shook his head.
The problem was with him.

A sudden light burst forth in his eyes.
It held an irrepressible joy.

"Professor, are you happy?"

"Of course I'm happy.
Your mother found her family.
You have grandparents now.
And a cousin.
Isn't that worth being happy about?"

Sophia nodded with a smile.
"It is something to be happy about."

But he had clearly been in low spirits earlier.
Why such a sudden, dramatic change?

Alexander asked for another beer.
"I want to drink more."

"There's none left in the fridge."

"Then never mind.
I'll do the dishes."

He collected the bowls and chopsticks and walked into the kitchen.
Even his shadow seemed light and cheerful.

Sophia was covered in question marks.

Alexander finished washing the dishes with practiced ease.
He dried his hands and came out.
"Let's go for a night run together."

Sophia almost choked on her water.
She glanced at the wall clock.
It was 11:40 PM.

"At this hour?
Are you sure?"
Alexander Laurent glanced at the wall clock.
###Chapter 408
This really wasn't the right time.

The tips of his ears flushed red instantly.

Yet his expression remained stern. "If not tonight... would tomorrow night work?"

"No problem." Sophia Sullivan nodded gently.

"Do you have lab tomorrow?" he asked again.

"Mhm."

Alexander: "What time are you heading out?"

"Around eight. Do you need something, Professor?"

"I'll walk with you. I'll bring breakfast. Those potato pies and black soy milk from the shop by the university gate. You said you liked them last time."

"Okay, thank you, Professor." Sophia smiled in agreement.

"It's getting late. I should head back now."

"Alright."

Sophia saw him to the door.

Alexander turned around. "Goodnight."

"Goodnight."

The door closed softly behind him, the motion light and almost cheerful.

Sophia fell asleep soon after lying down.

Next door, Alexander Laurent was wide awake.

Cousin?

He was actually her cousin!

He couldn't stop the corners of his mouth from lifting.

He was still full of energy at one in the morning.

He simply got out of bed and turned on his computer.

He worked on his paper until three a.m.

He was awake again before six.

He left promptly at seven-thirty to buy breakfast.

At eight o'clock sharp, he knocked on Sophia Sullivan's door.

"Good morning, Professor."

"Morning." He handed her the breakfast. "Eat it while it's hot."

"Thank you." Sophia took the bag. "Shall we go now?"

Alexander nodded.

"Together?"

"Okay."

...

At nine o'clock, Quincy Evans arrived at the lab.

Remembering Alexander's odd behavior yesterday, he decided to offer some more advice.

Sure enough, he found the man buried in work in the experimental zone.

"Alex, don't push yourself so hard. Your health matters."

"I'm not pushing."

"Still in denial? Didn't you come clean yesterday?" Quincy teased.

"Really, I'm not."

Quincy took a closer look; the man's grin was practically reaching his ears. "What's going on? Did you confess last night?"

Alexander: "...No."

"Then what's with that disgusting smile?"

"The misunderstanding is cleared up."

"Huh?"

Alexander: "It was all a misunderstanding."

"Alright then, whatever makes you happy."

"Meeting in the conference room once everyone's here."

Quincy: "What's it about?"

"I'll explain then."

By nine-twenty, everyone had gathered.

In the conference room, Alexander Laurent produced a stack of documents.

"...What's this?" Quincy leaned in to look, and immediately froze.

"This— this—"

"Professor Evans, what is it?"

Quincy flipped through a few more pages. Twelve brand new research project proposals!

"Alex, you didn't put these together last night, did you?"

Alexander nodded calmly. "The last project will wrap up before the New Year. These are potential follow-up research directions. Let's discuss and finalize them quickly so we can begin execution."

Everyone immediately crowded around.

Zoe Langley: "Am I hearing this right? Finalizing next year's plans already?"

Simon Lowell swallowed hard. "Face it, Zoe."

He looked at the thickness of the stack. "This is enough to keep us busy for two or three years."

Quincy fell silent.

Did this guy take stimulants last night?

He gets his mojo back and immediately starts working everyone else to the bone!

If he'd known, he wouldn't have given him advice. He should have just let him stay miserable!

...

Good news arrived in early February.

The winners list for the National Collegiate Life Sciences Championship was about to be announced!

Hannah Morse clung to her laptop, waiting.

At ten a.m. sharp, she refreshed the official website.

The page lagged due to heavy traffic.

Sophia Sullivan and Marcus Lawrence gathered around her.

Hannah was confident about their group project. "I think we can get the Grand Prize!"

Sophia chuckled. "That confident?"

Marcus shot her a look; she was clearly just as sure herself.

Hannah's eyes sparkled. "If we win the Grand Prize, let's go out for a huge feast to celebrate!"

Marcus: "...You're just using this as an excuse to eat, aren't you?"

"..." This guy really didn't know how to have a conversation!

Just as Hannah was about to roll her eyes, the webpage finally loaded.

She quickly found the winners list page. "There are quite a few Grand Prize groups. Let me find where we are..."

She scanned it carefully twice but couldn't find any of their three names.

Even more surprising, Ashley Lowell's group was prominently listed among the Grand Prize winners!
###Chapter 409

Hannah Morse  stared blankly at the screen.

"How could this be?"

Marcus Lawrence scrolled through the list again, his brow furrowed. "Don't panic. Let's check the first, second, and third prizes."

"...Okay."

Ten minutes later—

Hannah Morse  was even more confused. "I've gone through the entire list five times. We're not on it."

This meant—

They hadn't won anything from the Grand Prize down to the third prize.

Marcus Lawrence fell silent, his frown deepening.

Suddenly, Miao shot to her feet. "Impossible! There must be a mistake!"

Marcus Lawrence analyzed calmly. "I know luck plays a role. No one can guarantee a win. But... this is too extreme."

Even if they didn't get the Grand Prize, they should have at least received an Honorable Mention.

How could their names be completely absent from the list?

"Sophia, what do you think?"

They both turned to look at Sophia Sullivan.

She had remained silent since Miao opened the list.

"...It is very strange."

Hannah Morse  clapped her hands, suddenly feeling vindicated. "See! Sophia thinks so too!"

"But... the list is already published. What can we do? We can't just go to the organizers and say we don't accept the results, right?"

She was just venting. Common sense said it was impossible.

If every team that didn't win made a fuss, it would be chaos.

Sophia said, "Here's what we'll do. I'll contact the school administration first. Ideally, we get our project report back. We need to review it ourselves for any fundamental issues."

"Like data fabrication or deviation from the topic."

A competition rule stated that certain violations would result in an automatic zero.

A zero score naturally meant no award.

...

Although it was winter break, someone was on duty at the school's administrative office.

The staff member listened to Sophia's request and replied bluntly, "That's correct. The reports were submitted to the school first. But the school has no authority over them."

"Simply put, the school just collected the reports and forwarded them, untouched, to the competition judging panel."

She emphasized four words—

Untouched!

Sophia asked, "Can we apply to have the report returned?"

"I'm not sure about that. But if you want your report back, you should contact the organizers, not trouble the school."

Trouble...

The word was deliberately rude.

Sophia smiled. "First, I asked about the application process, not demanded the report directly from the school."

"Second, I came to the school first because the reports were originally submitted here. To get them back, shouldn't we go through the school as the intermediary?"

"Considering this, I asked. Is there a problem?"

"How did that become me 'troubling' the school?"

"Is asking about the procedure not allowed?"

"The school collected and submitted the reports. Now, to retrieve them, I shouldn't contact the school?"

"Even shopping has customer service. Does the school start things and not finish them? Isn't that irresponsible?"

At this point, Sophia knew further questions were useless.

Before the other person could respond, she said coolly, "Then I won't disturb your streaming. Goodbye."

The staff member stiffened, instinctively checking her computer screen.

It was minimized and hidden. How did she...?

A colleague watching nearby muttered, "Why did you have to provoke her? Her logic, debate skills, and eloquence are top-tier."

"That student has a sharp tongue. Who is she? Do you know her?"

"Everyone in the School of Life Sciences knows Sophia Sullivan. The powerhouse who built her own smart lab with two partners."

"She's published in 'Science' and 'Nature' sub-journals. The school's entire academic output for next year is riding on her. How do you not know her?!"

"I've heard the name Sophia Sullivan... but I didn't know she looked like that..."

This was just great!

"But, she's not that amazing, is she? Published all those impressive papers, but can't handle a small-time student competition?"

"She said it herself just now. Her team didn't win any awards."

The colleague gave her a sidelong glance, his tone chilly. "Why do you think she came to the administration?"

"W-why?"

"She said she wants the project report back. Think about the deeper reason! She must want to investigate why they didn't win."

"Didn't win, so what? Why investigate?! Maybe she just can't accept losing!"

"That's possible. But another possibility is more likely."

"What possibility?"

"She wants the report back because she suspects it was tampered with! She wants to get to the bottom of this!"

"Pfft— who has time to mess with her report? That's ridiculous!"

"Yeah, who would tamper with her report? The problem is either with the judging or the submission process."

"If I were you, I wouldn't be laughing right now."

Because if the investigation revealed the problem occurred during submission, the school would be responsible.

Further investigation would implicate everyone who handled the reports.

Which happened to include their administrative office!

So, was it still funny?

The staff member's face paled. "This... this is a false accusation!"

"Whether it's false or not will be clear once she investigates."

...

Back at the lab—

Hannah Morse  immediately approached her. "Sophia, what did the school say?"

"Useless."

Hannah Morse 's smile vanished, her eyes dimming.

Marcus Lawrence asked, "Can we get the report back?"

Sophia replied, "The school said contacting them is pointless. We need to go to the organizers."

"What do we do next?"

Sophia said, "The trip wasn't wasted. It at least strengthened my resolve to get that report back."

Perhaps the answer lay within it!

Hannah Morse  busied herself on the computer. "Sophia! I found the organizers' contact number on the official website!"

"Try calling it."

"Okay."

Marcus Lawrence immediately took out his phone and dialed the number.

After a series of rings—

"Sorry, the number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later..."

Sophia said, "Try again later."

Marcus Lawrence nodded. "Okay."

Afternoon—

"Any luck? Did they answer?" Hannah Morse  came down from the lab bench, asking eagerly.

Marcus Lawrence's gaze turned cold.
###Chapter 410
Still no answer.

This is unbelievable.
The evasive university administration and the unresponsive organizers.
I refuse to believe there isn't something fishy going on here.

Sophia fell silent for a moment, then an idea struck her.
The judges for a national competition like this are usually university professors.
I remember the official website published the list of judges.
Let's see if there's anyone from our school.

Hannah immediately opened her laptop.
After some searching, she found it.

Sophia looked over the list.
But from top to bottom, she didn't see a single professor from MIT.

Marcus explained.
Because MIT and Caltech have been fierce competitors in previous years, often taking half the awards between them, the organizers typically don't invite professors from these schools to be judges.
It's to avoid any perceived bias.

To put it simply, it's a conflict of interest.

Hannah frowned.
But we don't know any professors from other schools.
How do we even contact them?

Even if we did, they might not bother to talk to us.

Sophia thought for a second.
We might not know them, but that doesn't mean the professors don't know each other.

"What are you thinking, Sophia?"

I'll go see Professor Watson.
She probably knows someone on this list.

Professor Eleanor Watson was abroad again for an academic conference.
Because of the time difference, a phone call wasn't practical.
So Sophia sent a detailed email explaining the entire situation.

She received a reply from Professor Watson that very night.

Professor Watson supported their investigation into the truth and recovering their research report.

Secondly, her phone would be on 24/7 from now on.
She would respond immediately if they needed anything.

Finally, and this was what Sophia cared about most.
There was indeed someone on the list she knew.

But she only knew them in passing.
They weren't close, and she didn't have their contact information.

However, this professor was on good terms with Alexander Laurent.

So, during their evening run that night, Sophia explained everything to Alexander.
That's the situation.
Since we can't reach the organizers and the university is being evasive, we want to try contacting the judging panel directly.
Even just one judge would be enough.

"You want to meet Professor Harrison?"

Sophia nodded.
If it's convenient.
If not, even a phone call would work.

"Alright. I'll contact him for you."

"Thank you, Professor. I'm sorry to trouble you again."
Sophia smiled awkwardly.
"It seems like ever since we met, you've always been the one helping me."

"Who said that? You've helped me a great deal too."

Sophia was surprised.
"Like what?"

"Before I met you, I could only make simple meals."
"Now, I can fillet a fish and prepare a chicken without any problem."

Sophia blushed, mumbling.
"That sounds a bit like a complaint."

Alexander coughed lightly.
"Absolutely not."
"I meant that since meeting you, I've experienced the simple joys of daily life."
"For me, it's been a rare and valuable experience."

The next day, Alexander arranged a meeting with Professor Harrison.

The location was a chain coffee shop.

Alexander and Sophia arrived early to wait.

Sophia looked around, hesitating to speak.

Alexander noticed and asked, "What is it?"

"Wouldn't a teahouse or a restaurant have been more appropriate?"

Before coming, Sophia had looked up Professor Harrison's background.
A titan in the field of cell biology.
The current dean of the School of Life Sciences at a prestigious university.
His academic achievements were among the top in the country.

Alexander couldn't help but laugh.
"That's a stereotype."
"Professor Harrison is in his seventies, but he's young at heart."
"He keeps up with the times."
"He enjoys reading web novels, binge-watching palace dramas, and drinking Luckin coffee."

Sophia was taken aback.

"Sounds rather unreliable, doesn't he?"
"You'll understand when you meet him."

Ten minutes later, a tall figure appeared opposite them.

"Hey, Alex."

Sophia looked closely.
Even though she was prepared, she was still stunned, her eyes wide with disbelief.
###Chapter 411

This was more than just unreliable.

This was utterly unpredictable.

The man before her—no, judging by his attire, it was hard to tell his age at all.

A GAP sweatshirt.
Levi's jeans.
A Moncler down jacket draped over his arm.

A baseball cap covered his gray hair.

His slightly wrinkled eyes were hidden behind sunglasses.

How could anyone guess his age?

No wonder Alexander had described him as 'young at heart' and 'keeping up with the times.'
This was beyond fashionable.

"Professor Harrison, good to see you again."
Alexander stood up, smiling as he shook his hand, then glanced down at Sophia.

She quickly stood up as well.

Alexander made the introductions.
"My friend, Sophia Sullivan."
"This is Professor Harrison."

"Hello, Professor Harrison."

"Hello there, young lady."
"Sit, sit, sit."
"Don't be so formal."
"I'm not some old fossil with a massive ego."
"Let's just chat over coffee like friends."
"No need to treat me like some revered elder.
I don't care for that."

During their conversation, Sophia learned Professor Harrison was from Shandong Province.
No wonder he was so tall.

"Professor, here's the situation."
"Not long ago, I formed a team with two other students to participate in this year's National Collegiate Life Sciences Championship."
"The results were announced yesterday."
"To our embarrassment, we didn't win any awards."
"Now, I want to retrieve our research report."
"But both the university and the organizers have been unhelpful."

"I know you've served as a judge before."
"I just wanted to ask, as a participant, is it a reasonable request to ask for our report back after the judging is over?"

Professor Harrison looked surprised.
"You don't need to apply for it."
"According to the regulations, after the review process ends, all research reports are returned to each member of the participating teams."
"The students under me who entered the competition this year have already received their reports."
"How have you not received yours?"

Sophia was shocked.
"They get returned?
But we truly haven't received anything."

Professor Harrison stated firmly.
"Impossible."
"To my knowledge, the judging panel's work was completed by mid-January."
"Following past practice, the reports should have been returned gradually."
"By now, the organizers should have basically finished mailing them all back."
"Some received theirs as early as a week ago."
"Those who haven't should receive them by this week at the latest."

Sophia thought carefully.
She hadn't received any courier notifications in the last two weeks.

To be safe, she called Hannah and Marcus on the spot to confirm.
Both stated they hadn't received any couriered documents.

Seeing this, Professor Harrison pondered for a moment.
"You could also check with the university office."
"During the winter break, they might be short-staffed."
"Delays in receiving mail are possible."

"Alright."

After that, Sophia became somewhat quiet.
Thoughtfulness flickered in her eyes from time to time.

To avoid an awkward silence, Alexander kept chatting with Professor Harrison.
All the while, he kept an eye on Sophia's state out of the corner of his eye.
Professor Harrison set down his coffee cup, his brow slightly furrowed.

"Fifty percent of the projects submitted for this competition are grandiose and empty."

"Forty percent are pure nonsense."

"Only the remaining ten percent are barely worth looking at."

He sighed softly.

"Students these days are becoming more and more impatient."

"The academic atmosphere is also far worse than before."

"The winners from the earliest special award competitions were all potential candidates for 'Science' and 'Nature'."

"Now... sigh."

He shook his head.

"There was one pleasant surprise this year, however."

"The team from MIT, project titled 'Genetic Testing and Biomedicine', team leader Ashley Lowell."

"Grand Prize."

"The judging panel unanimously agreed it was worthy of submission to an SCI journal."

"Several professors specifically inquired about Ashley Lowell."

"Published numerous papers as a first-year graduate student."

"A renowned prodigy in the School of Life Sciences."

Sophia Sullivan didn't hear another word Professor Harrison said after that.

From the moment she heard the project title, her entire body went rigid.

This was their group's project!

How did it become Ashley Lowell's?

Her mind went blank for a second, then Sophia quickly composed herself.

This was serious.

...

Caleb Watson dragged his exhausted body back to his dorm.

The consecutive late nights left him with a splitting headache.

This winter break, on Professor Victoria Lowell's orders, everyone was forced to stay on campus.

The lab was under renovation.

Their research had completely stalled.

For the first couple of days, he still held out hope that the renovations would end soon.

Reality had harshly proven him wrong.

After idling around for a few days, Caleb felt himself becoming useless.

Fortunately, a senior recommended a part-time job.

A biological lab at a cosmetics company.

Daily pay of two thousand.

Caleb agreed without hesitation.

Even when they emphasized the high work intensity, he didn't mind.

Since when was making money easy?

It wasn't until he actually entered the lab that he understood the importance of his senior's warning.

It was truly exhausting.

But it was also genuinely fulfilling.

Caleb traveled between the lab and his dorm every day, persisting until now.

Ashley Lowell had contacted him a few times in between.

He didn't go.

Ashley called several times, hinting that he should continue writing the paper.

Caleb simply laughed coldly.

"No lab, how do I write? Steal? Rob? Give me a solution."

Ashley cursed him for being sarcastic.

Caleb calmly hung up.

Right now, all he wanted was to collapse into sleep.

But when he pushed open the dorm door, he saw Jude Granger sitting on the edge of the bed, crying.

Hearing the noise, Jude jumped up abruptly.

"Bro, you're back..." He turned away hurriedly, wiping his face.

Caleb's expression darkened instantly. "What's wrong?"

"N-nothing..."

"Nothing? Then why are you crying?"

Jude stammered, "I watched a movie... was too moved..."

Caleb's face was expressionless. "Do I look that easy to fool?"

Jude fell silent.

"We worked hard to get from the countryside to Kyoto. It wasn't easy."

"We should support each other. Tell me the truth."

Jude's lips quivered. "It's really nothing."

Caleb frowned. "Is it about the competition?"

Jude's nose stung. He could no longer hold back. "Ashley kicked me out of the group."

"I didn't know until the awards were announced. My name wasn't on the list at all."

"I don't understand why she's targeting me."

"I participated in the entire project. Collected data. Did the grunt work. I did my best."

"Why would she do this to me?"
Jude Granger sat on the floor.
###Chapter 412

Tears streamed down his face uncontrollably.

He was a big guy, but curled up, he looked like an abandoned puppy.

Deep down, he had always known.
Ashley Lowell and her group never truly considered him one of them.

Their exclusion was blatant, written plainly on their faces.
They couldn't even be bothered to hide it.

Jude Granger had tried to win them over.
People naturally seek a sense of belonging, especially in an unfamiliar environment.

But no matter how friendly he was, they always looked down on him.
They never gave him the time of day.

Over time, Jude Granger gave up.
Some circles are just impossible to break into.
Trying too hard is useless.

So when the competition sign-ups began, he never even considered joining Ashley's team.
He had already settled on a research direction and was preparing to form his own group.

To his surprise, Ashley approached him first.
She invited him to join.

Jude Granger was stunned and didn't immediately agree.
Ashley thought he was too happy to speak and left with a scornful laugh.

Jude Granger wrestled with the decision for two days.
He ultimately decided to decline.

But by the time he found Ashley, the participant list had already been submitted.

"What's that look for?" she sneered.
"Letting you join is doing you a favor. Don't be ungrateful!"

Shane Holloway chimed in from the side.
"Yeah! If it weren't for the fact we're classmates, who'd want to carry you? You should be grateful!"

Jude Granger never got a chance to refuse.
He was forced into the group.

He adjusted his mindset, deciding to do his best since he was in.
Ashley tasked him with gathering research papers.
He spent three days and two nights compiling the data.

He hadn't even rested half a day before a new task arrived.

During this period, Jude Granger was even more exhausted than Caleb Watson.
At least Caleb got paid for overtime and could sleep through the night.

Jude Granger was on call twenty-four seven, run ragged by Ashley's demands.

Caleb watched him curled pathetically on the floor and frowned.
"Stop crying for now. Let me see the project report."

Jude Granger was confused. "...What report?"

"The final summary report that was submitted."

"I... I don't have it."

"What?!" Caleb was shocked.
"How can you not have it? Every group member submits a report. Even if the content is similar, different signatures represent individual work. Since Ashley included your name, there should be a report with your name on it."

Jude Granger was completely baffled.
"But I really don't... Ashley only had me collect data. She said she would handle the final submission."

Caleb asked, "She didn't have you print a copy?"

"No."

"And the others didn't tell you either?"

Jude Granger shook his head.

"Bastards!" Caleb's veins bulged on his forehead in anger.
"After the results are announced every year, the reports are returned to the group members. By now, you should have received it! If not the original, at least a copy."

Jude Granger mumbled, "I didn't get anything..."

Caleb gritted his teeth.
"Wait here in the dorm. I'm going out."

He turned and rushed out of the dorm, heading straight for Professor Victoria Lowell's office.

He raised his hand to knock, but paused when he heard voices inside.

Professor Lowell said, "You did well this time. A trial run and you won the Grand Prize."

It brought glory to the department and made her, as the advisor, look good.
After months of frustration, she could finally hold her head high.
She was in an excellent mood.

Ashley laughed. "I have to thank Sophia Sullivan, really. Auntie, how is she so talented? Publishing in 'Science' and 'Nature' like it's nothing... Even for a competition, she came up with such a brilliant project..."

Her tone was laced with envy.
Ashley had stolen Sophia's work, but she genuinely admired her ability.

Professor Lowell sipped her tea, unimpressed.
"This is what you call impressive? Hah— You can do anything she can. She's just lucky enough to have started earlier. You'll surpass her eventually!"

Ashley agreed verbally but laughed bitterly inside.
Surpass Sophia Sullivan?
She didn't even dare dream of it.

She used to believe her own "genius girl" hype.
But the more she experienced, the more she understood there was always someone better.

Sophia was truly exceptional.
And herself?
Well, she was pretty mediocre.

Fortunately, they had won the "Grand Prize" this time.
No matter the methods, the award was theirs.

Professor Lowell blew on her tea, a smug smile playing on her lips.
"Thankfully, I switched the reports ahead of time. Sophia's group had nothing to submit, so they couldn't possibly place. Once the results are out, their reports won't be returned to them. Our secret is safe. They won't even know what hit them!"

Ashley massaged her aunt's shoulders, smiling.
"Auntie, you're amazing."

This wasn't their first time doing this; they were old hands.
Sophia and her team would just think they lacked ability or were unlucky.
They'd never suspect the reports had been tampered with.

"Sophia worked so hard, only to pave the way for us. How ridiculous!"

After basking in her triumph, Professor Lowell asked, "No one on our side suspects anything, right?"

Ashley pouted. "They're benefiting from the Grand Prize too; they're thrilled. Even if they noticed something off, they wouldn't dare speak up. Who would throw away honor that's fallen into their lap?"

Ashley's eyes shifted. "Auntie, there's one more thing I forgot to mention... but it's probably not a big deal..."

Professor Lowell raised an eyebrow. "Go on."

"I removed Jude Granger's name from the list. So he's the only one who didn't get an award."

Professor Lowell's brow furrowed. "Does he know?"

"...No."

"Did you have him do any work in the early stages?"

Ashley nodded.

Professor Lowell's face suddenly changed. "Are you an idiot?!"
###Chapter 413

Caleb's Counterattack

Professor Victoria Lowell frowned.

"You made him do the work, but then you removed his name?"

"Do you really think I care if he's okay with it?" Ashley lifted her chin.

"He's just some poor country boy. But have you considered what happens if he sees others getting awards and gets nothing?"

"What if he discovers the truth and decides to go scorched earth?"

"Impossible." Ashley scoffed. "He's an idiot. He'd help count the money after you sold him out."

Victoria's expression turned serious. "Don't forget, Jude has Caleb backing him."

Ashley snorted coldly. "Don't even get me started on Caleb. It makes me furious."

"He's working part-time off-campus every day now. Leaves early, comes back late."

"Does that even look like a student?"

"Last week I told him to write a paper. He hung up on me!"

"He's getting more arrogant. He doesn't respect you at all."

Victoria's face darkened.

Ashley continued to pour fuel on the fire. "I also heard Caleb has connections with Sophia Sullivan and her friends."

"Who said that?"

"Does it need to be said? If he didn't have connections, why did Sophia send him a personal invitation to her lab's opening?"

"Caleb got an invitation?!"

"Auntie, you didn't know? It's all over the institute."

"Everyone's saying Senior Caleb has serious clout."

"That Caleb!"

A secret smile tugged at Ashley's lips.

"Has Jude made any trouble?"

"Nothing. Probably hiding somewhere crying."

"Good. Don't leave any evidence," Victoria warned.

"Don't worry. He wouldn't dare."

Victoria looked at her. "I can't help you forever. You need to stand on your own."

"Publish more papers. You have the ability. Then it will be easier for me to secure resources for you."

Ashley felt a pang of guilt but nodded. "I understand."

"You're the one I've put all my support behind. Many eyes are watching. Don't make any mistakes."

Victoria paused. "Caleb is an outsider. A dog that can't be tamed."

She only wanted to cultivate her own niece.

Caleb was just a tool to hold a position. She never intended for him to take over.

Once Ashley established herself, Caleb would be useless.

Ashley promised readily. "Don't worry, Auntie. I won't let you down!"

Victoria smiled. "Good. I'll be waiting."

Outside the door, Caleb put away his phone.

His face was expressionless as he walked away.

Three days later, a post exploded on the university's internal forum.

"Real Name Report: Professor Victoria Lowell of MIT's School of Life Sciences! Five Major Crimes!"

The post was ten pages long. The content was explosive.

The whistleblower was none other than Victoria's own protégé, Caleb Watson.

He accused Victoria of academic fraud, favoritism in admissions, bribery, and hiring ghostwriters for her niece.

The post ended with a PDF over thirty pages long.

Each accusation was backed with solid evidence.

Exploiting students, demanding gifts, psychological manipulation.

The most shocking accusation was stealing Caleb's research成果 for years.

Forcing him to be Ashley's ghostwriter.

Pictures and truth were included.

The MIT forum instantly erupted.

"Thirty pages and my heart is pounding. Is this for real?"

"TL;DR: Advisor commits academic misconduct, exploited student fights back."

"Starting from high school? Ashley's college entrance exam bonus points and grad school recommendation were all cheated?"

"What 'genius girl'? More like a fraud witch!"

"A protégé reporting their own advisor? First time seeing this!"

"Either the student is terrible, or the advisor deserves it."

"Every word is written in blood! I feel for the tool. Support Caleb!"

"Senior Caleb has it so rough."

"Making students do house chores? Using them as beasts of burden?"

"Are the lives of beasts of burden not lives?"

"Professor Lowell has high academic output, but it's all stolen from students? Disgusting!"

"Don't spread rumors without confirmation."

"PR teams cleaning up? The evidence is irrefutable!"

It was winter break, but the discussion around the post kept skyrocketing.

Perhaps because everyone was free, they all turned into gossipers, hopping around the melon field.

Inside the Aetheria Lab, Hannah Morse spent the whole morning on her phone.

Her exclamations of surprise never stopped.

"Caleb is this brave?"

"Is Professor Lowell made of coal? So black!"

"My worldview is refreshed."

"There are such vicious advisors? So glad I chose Professor Watson."

Hannah complained while reading.

Sophia Sullivan looked up from the experiment table. "How many pages is the PDF?"

"Thirty-seven."

"He prepared this a long time ago." Sophia sighed softly. "I just didn't expect..."

Hannah blinked. "Didn't expect what?"

"I didn't expect he would choose the hardest path."
###Chapter 414

"Difficult?" Hannah blinked.
"What's so hard about reporting someone? The evidence is solid."
"Once public opinion builds, the school has to deal with Professor Lowell. It's much faster than a lawsuit."

Under public pressure, the administration would have to act seriously.

Everyone would be watching.

Marcus Lawrence shook his head.
"Reporting is indeed the fastest way. But look closely at that post."

"I've read it several times. It seems fine."

"Caleb used his real name."

Hannah frowned.
"What's wrong with using a real name?"

Marcus had a complicated expression. The naive girl was still staring at him innocently.

He sighed helplessly.

"A student reporting their advisor only has two outcomes."
"Succeed, and the advisor gets punished."
"Fail, and the advisor remains unscathed."
"But in either case, the student ends up in a difficult position."

Hannah frowned.
"I understand failing. The advisor would definitely retaliate."
"But why is succeeding also difficult?"

Marcus countered.
"What happens after success?"

"The professor gets fired. In serious cases, they might even go to jail!"

"The advisor is fired. What about the student?"
"Caleb is in his third year of graduate school. He's about to graduate. What does he do then?"

Hannah froze, finally understanding.

If the advisor is fired, Caleb cannot graduate.

Even if he changes advisors, he would have to change his research direction.

Three years of hard work would be wasted.

A graduate student who can't graduate is worse off than an undergraduate.

Undergraduates of the same age are younger and have more advantages.

Hannah was silent for a long time before whispering, "...He just needed to hold on for a few more months to graduate..."

Yes, enduring a few more months to get his diploma would have meant true freedom.

But Caleb chose to expose everything at this very moment.

"So," Sophia Sullivan put down the things in her hands, "he has no way out—he can only win."

Marcus frowned.
"From the looks of it, his chances of winning are very slim."

"But it's all over the forum! Over thirty pages of material can't take down Victoria Lowell?" Hannah couldn't believe it.

She thought public pressure would be enough to force the school to act seriously.

But Sophia and Marcus clearly didn't think so.

Marcus explained.
"Public opinion varies in scale."
"Right now, it's only spreading within the school."
"It hasn't reached the outside world."
"What good does it do if only our students know?"

Hannah gasped.
"The school will protect Professor Lowell?"

Sophia said solemnly, "Protecting Victoria Lowell means protecting the school's reputation."

"But everyone is watching! Would the school dare to openly shield her?"

Marcus snorted lightly.
"The administration is watching and waiting."
"If the wind changes direction, they will step in."
"Whether they protect or abandon her depends on which side has more weight."

"Then... can we help Caleb? Add some weight to our side of the scale?"

Marcus raised an eyebrow.
"We can. But we need a plan for how to do it specifically..."

Sophia seemed lost in thought.

Suddenly, both of them looked at her.

"Wait..." She laughed. "Why are you two staring at me?"

"Sophia, think of a way. Let's help Caleb."
"Let's take this chance to deal with Victoria Lowell so she can't harm anyone else."

Marcus nodded.
"She's screwed us over so many times. It's time she paid her debt."

Sophia's eyes flickered.
"Hannah, call Caleb. Tell him..."

...

Sophia and Marcus were right. When the post was first published, it was very popular.

The discussion volume broke one hundred thousand.

But the school didn't respond. Victoria Lowell didn't show herself.
With no new developments, the onlookers gradually dispersed.

The heat began to decline.

In a few more days, this storm would calm down and be forgotten.

"Tch—" Victoria Lowell had been following the progress, remaining calm as if she hadn't been reported.

Now, she smiled contemptuously.

Ashley Lowell wasn't nearly as composed.

Since the post went up, she had been on the verge of a breakdown.

She had been crying for three whole days.

Her tears never stopped as she kept refreshing the forum.

Seeing the hateful comments, she started crying again, eventually crying herself into a faint.

Victoria scolded her.
"Useless! I'm not dead yet, why are you crying? Are you cursing me or disgusting me?"

She walked over and grabbed Ashley, who had fainted on the couch.

Ashley cried out in pain.
"Auntie, that hurts—"

"You know it hurts? I hope it hurts you to death!"

"I'm... I'm scared... Caleb reported you using his real name. He exposed everything..."
"Auntie, will the school expel us?"

"Expel me? Can they just fire a full professor that easily?"
"It's been three days. Has the school said a single word?"

"...What does that mean?" Ashley was confused.

"You think I've been at MIT all these years for nothing?" Victoria sneered.
"The administration is watching and waiting."
"Once the post's heat dies down, dragging it out for a while will make it all go away."

"I'll be fine. You'll be fine too. Pull yourself together! Stop looking so mournful!"

Ashley asked, "...R-really? It'll be okay?"

Victoria put on her coat and changed her shoes, ready to go out. She couldn't be bothered to answer such a stupid question.

"Auntie, where are you going?"

Victoria narrowed her eyes.
"To see my dear student. The one who started this whole storm!"

School office—

Victoria looked at the thin, stubborn young man in front of her and let out an exaggerated laugh.
"Ha..."

Caleb looked up and met her gaze directly.

"The quiet dogs are the ones that bite the hardest!"
"Usually acting so honest, but striking with a deadly move as soon as you make your move."
"Over thirty pages of reporting material. Written very well."
"Clear and logical, straight to the point."
###Chapter 415

A sharp slap echoed through the office.

A cold smirk played on Professor Victoria Lowell's lips.

"Have you forgotten? I hold your diploma in my hands."

"Issue a public apology now, and I might still let you graduate smoothly."

Caleb Watson gave a bitter twist of his mouth.

"I've already made my decision."

His eyes were bloodshot, but his gaze was unusually resolute.

"Dare you claim a single word in that report is false?"

Professor Lowell raised a contemptuous eyebrow.

"Does the truth even matter?"

"Since you're choosing this path, don't blame me for being ruthless."

Caleb found it laughable.

A teacher-student bond?

She had only ever treated him like a dog.

He could have remained silent.

Just five more months, and he could graduate and leave.

But what about Jude Granger?

Jude wasn't the first.

And he wouldn't be the last.

As long as Victoria Lowell remained in charge of admissions.

There would be more victims.

He couldn't stand by and watch others repeat this cycle.

He remembered Sophia Sullivan's courage.

Now it was his turn to stand up.

The conversation ended badly.

Professor Lowell issued her final ultimatum.

"My patience is limited."

"The offer won't stand forever."

...

Caleb didn't sleep a wink that night.

Early the next morning.

A long video was posted by a TikTok user.

"Real Name Report: Professor Victoria L. of MIT School of Life Sciences for Academic Fraud."

The main text was 125 pages long.

The author's name was: Caleb Watson.

It detailed all the fraudulent papers and data.

It ended with a final statement.

"I've waited too long for this day."

"I know how important a degree is to a third-year grad student."

"In five months, I could have left this disgusting place."

"But when I made this decision."

"Graduation became a distant dream."

"Someone had to step up."

"To do what seems foolish but is necessary."

"I refuse to let more people be destroyed."

"I refuse to watch passion be extinguished."

"Even an ant shaking a tree doesn't matter."

"If it saves just one victim."

"It's worth it."

The video exploded within two hours.

Likes surpassed 500,000.

Comments exceeded 100,000.

Shares reached a million.

Numerous netizens mentioned MIT's official accounts.

Concerned citizens used TikTok+ to boost the topic.

The comment section was boiling.

[He could have stayed silent and waited for freedom.]

[Instead, he turned and walked into the abyss.]

[Just to pull others back from the edge.]

[The meaning of studying has changed.]

[Picture of Goethe included.]

[I used to envy those top students.]

[They worked so hard to get into the best schools.]

[Only to encounter advisors like this.]

[I went to a no-name college.]

[I want to say something.]

[He's the kind of person I admire.]

[I don't want to see him fail.]

[Caleb Watson.]

[May your future be bright.]

[May your life be brilliant.]

[A young man shouldn't be an unfinished book of poetry.]

[He should be the most shocking chapter in a banned novel.]

...

At noon.

A second post went up.

A full ten-minute audio recording.

Documenting a conversation between Victoria Lowell and Ashley Lowell.

It only had system-generated captions.

By 1 PM.

It became the trending topic.

#MIT Student Reports Advisor by Real Name#

It was the number one trending topic on all major platforms.

Netizens flooded MIT's official website.

The reporting server crashed.

The official account was mentioned numerous times.

The comments were all positive.

University leadership rushed back to campus overnight.

An emergency meeting lasted until dawn.

"Victoria Lowell!"

The leaders gritted their teeth.

A century of reputation was destroyed in one day.

"Why wasn't this reported?!"

"Investigate that competition thoroughly!"

"If this isn't cleared up, everyone will be held responsible!"

After a night of arguing.

Early the next morning.

An official announcement was finally released.

"Notice on the Handling of Academic Misconduct and Other Issues Concerning V.L."

A special investigation team was formed.

A comprehensive review was conducted.

11 papers were found to have fabricated data.

10 papers had improper authorship.

1 research project was fraudulent.

According to relevant regulations.

All of V.L.'s positions were revoked.

Her employment contract was terminated.

Her teaching credentials were recommended for revocation.

Papers were retracted.

Awards were rescinded.

Her editor-in-chief textbook was suspended.

The school issued a public criticism.

Related responsible parties were dealt with.

Other issues would continue to be investigated.

The response was relatively timely.

The punishment seemed appropriate.

But netizens immediately spotted the flaw.

[What about Caleb?]

[The announcement doesn't mention Caleb at all.]

[Is this a death sentence for him?]
###Chapter 416

Stupid! So incredibly stupid!

The main administration office was brightly lit.

"How long has the statement been out?"

"Two hours."

"Public reaction?"

"..."

"Speak!"

"Number one trending topic."

The leader nodded, unsurprised.

The reporting incident had caused an uproar.

The university's response was naturally under intense scrutiny.

"And the sentiment?"

"...Not good."

"...Be specific."

"Netizens are all asking if Caleb Watson will be able to graduate successfully."

The leader froze.

...

In an upscale residential villa—

"It's over... it's all over..." Ashley Lowell was deathly pale, her entire body trembling.

She threw her phone aside and rushed into the bedroom.

"Auntie! Wake up! Something terrible has happened!"

Victoria Lowell was sleeping soundly and irritably turned over.

"Auntie! Something really bad has happened!" Ashley pushed her hard.

Victoria's eyes snapped open, and she slapped Ashley's hand away viciously—

"Are you trying to kill me?! What are you shrieking about so early in the morning?!"

Ashley's eyes were red, her hand stung, and her mind was in turmoil.

"It's practically the end of the world and you're still sleeping..." she wailed.

Victoria sat up irritably. "How many times have I told you to stay calm! Look at the state of you! Either crying or spacing out, clinging to your phone all day like a lost soul..."

"Auntie! Caleb Watson reported it again!" Ashley was hopping with anxiety.

Victoria scoffed. "Does he own the campus forum? If he posts, I'll just delete it again! How naive!"

"Not the forum, it's TikTok—"

"Get my slippers," Victoria interrupted, pointing to the foot of the bed.

Ashley stood rigid.

Victoria shot her a cold look.

She flinched and obediently fetched the slippers.

Victoria put them on and walked to the living room.

Ashley followed closely. "Caleb posted the video on TikTok."

Victoria paused while drinking water. "TikTok? Is he that desperate for fame?"

"What are you panicking for? Just report the video. Pick any reason."

"In this attention economy, without promotion, who's going to see it? Go report it now. Stop all this crying..."

Ashley suddenly felt utterly drained.

It was no wonder Caleb could win.

His opponent was too arrogant. Too stupid!

"It's not like that..."

Victoria walked into the kitchen and came out scowling. "Where's breakfast?"

Ashley silently picked up her phone, opened the trending page, and handed it over.

Smack—

Victoria knocked the phone away. "I asked you about breakfast! Are you handing me your phone to order takeout? Have you lost your tongue?"

"Just look at it!" Ashley forced the phone into her hands.

Victoria was furious. "You rebellious little brat!"

She was about to throw the phone when her eyes caught the screen and stopped dead.

She picked up the phone for a closer look.

The color drained from her face instantly. Arrogant composure turned into panic and horror.

"No... impossible... it's only been a day..."

Ashley spoke flatly. "Public opinion changes in a blink. You went to sleep yesterday. Anything could have happened."

"That little beast Caleb! Causing trouble on campus wasn't enough, he dares to take it outside?!"

Ashley's voice was cold. "Why wouldn't he dare? You threatened to prevent his graduation. Of course he'd fight back with everything he has! Maybe he can fight his way out!"

Smack—

Victoria slapped her across the face. "Who are you siding with?! If I go down, do you think you'll be fine?!"

Ashley didn't cry or make a scene. She slowly turned her stinging face back.

One side of her cheek rapidly reddened and swelled.

"What—what are you looking at?!" Victoria shrieked.

Ashley's expression was blank. "I'm looking at you, Auntie! Looking at you panicking. Looking at you reaping what you've sown. Looking at you falling from your high horse!"

"You—" Victoria raised her hand again.

This time, Ashley caught it and shoved her back against the wall.

"I won't let you hit and scold me anymore! I'm a person, not your slave!"

"Rebellion! Ashley, are you rebelling?!"

"Rebellion? Are you heaven? Are you worthy? Auntie, even if you were heaven, it's collapsing now! Hahahaha—shattering into pieces!"

"You—you think this can take me down?" She waved the phone. "I'm a full professor at MIT! I've published so many papers! Won so many awards! Can one student's slander convict me? Even if I'm guilty, the university would lose face too!"

"You think the university will still protect you?" Ashley asked with exaggerated disbelief, then burst into laughter. "Hahaha... So stupid! You always called me stupid, but now you're even stupider! Incredibly stupid! Take a good look!"

"The university has already issued a statement. You're fired! Understand?!"

Victoria's eyes widened. "No... impossible... The university wouldn't dare..."

Ashley swiped open her phone. MIT's official statement was right there.

Data fabrication... Improper attribution... Dereliction of duty... Inappropriate language... Negligent teaching...

Termination of employment... Revocation of qualifications... Retraction of publications...

"No! I'm a core professor! I have academic KPIs! How could the university fire me?! No... I don't believe it..."

Victoria began smashing things frantically.

Ashley watched coldly.

Stripped of her academic halo, this woman was no different from a madwoman.

So ridiculous!

This was the aunt she had idolized since childhood. The person she dreamed of becoming.

Turns out she was just this wretched!

...

That evening at eight, MIT issued a second official statement.

It directly addressed the issues of public concern.

Foremost among them was the matter of Caleb Watson's graduation.
###Chapter 417

The school issued an official announcement.

Caleb Watson would not face any disciplinary action regarding the whistleblowing incident.

He could choose a new advisor based on his research interests, and the school would facilitate the communication.

Secondly, the investigation confirmed that a graduate student under Professor Victoria Lowell had swapped another person's project report during a competition.

The individuals involved were removed from their positions, and the graduate student, Ms. Xu, was expelled.

Thirdly, the investigation found that Victoria Lowell had engaged in违规招生行为 during admissions. The involved student, Jiang Mouting, was expelled.

The school expressed deep regret and apologized for the negative impact caused by Victoria Lowell's academic misconduct.

They promised comprehensive reforms to uphold academic integrity.

…

Shane Holloway stood at the office door.

A group of people barged in and began removing computers and materials.

Amelia Roscente rushed forward to stop them.

"Who are you? Do you know what this place is?"

"Victoria Lowell's office. Correct."

"You know and you still dare to touch these? These are confidential materials!"

One of them coldly pushed her aside.

"We are the investigation team. We are seizing evidence in accordance with the law. Please cooperate."

Amelia froze.

Shane suddenly exclaimed, "Quick, look at your phone! The school released a statement!"

Amelia snatched the phone.

The screen clearly displayed the expulsion list.

"I've been expelled? On what grounds!"

A member of the investigation team frowned at her.

"You know very well how you got admitted."

"Parasites who got in through bribery won't be tolerated by the school."

They left with the evidence.

Amelia collapsed onto the floor.

Seeing her miserable state, Shane suddenly felt relieved.

Someone was worse off than him. He didn't need to be afraid anymore.

"I'm leaving first."

He quickly slipped away.

The Roscente family estate.

Amelia pushed the door open, looking utterly defeated.

Victoria Roscente, wearing a facial mask, called out to her.

"Why aren't you changing your shoes? The sea cucumbers from Australia have arrived. Deliver them to Professor Lowell tomorrow."

"...It's unnecessary."

"You must send them! Our grades are still in her hands!"

Amelia suddenly erupted.

"All you know is giving gifts! This is bribery!"

Victoria poked her head.

"Without gifts, would you have achieved what you have today?"

Amelia cried and laughed hysterically.

"Admit it! You're doing this for your own pride!"

"Because your low education made Grandma dislike you!"

"You forced me and my brother to study and take graduate exams!"

"But I'm not cut out for it! Now I'm expelled! Are you satisfied?"

She ran upstairs crying.

Victoria stood frozen in place.

Her facial mask dropped to the floor.

The beauty device slipped from her hand.

Her back hunched over.

She seemed to age ten years in an instant.

…

The whistleblowing incident concluded with a huge stir.

The school was busy managing public opinion.

Netizens cheered for the victory.

Only Caleb remained as calm as ever.

After the storm passed, he seemed like an outsider.

Victoria Lowell had been dealt with.

But Caleb's academic career was at a standstill.

The school tried to connect him with advisors.

All refused.

Everyone at school avoided him.

The professors kept their distance.

He endured it silently.

Only Jude Granger was still willing to approach him.

"Bro, let's go to the cafeteria?"

"Let's wait until it's less crowded."

"It hurts to see this... You're a hero!"

Caleb patted his shoulder.

"I don't regret it."

"But without an advisor, how will you graduate?"

Jude wiped his tears.

Caleb smiled faintly.

"Who would want a professional whistleblower?"

His phone suddenly rang.

"Hello?"

"Caleb, it's Hannah."

His gaze paused.

"Are you free? Sophia Sullivan wants to see you."
###Chapter 418

Caleb Watson agreed without hesitation.

He ended the call, his tense shoulders finally relaxing.

Jude Granger scratched his head, his eyes filled with confusion.

Inside an off-campus chain coffee shop—

The constant ping of delivery orders created a noisy atmosphere.

Sophia Sullivan and Hannah Morse pushed the door open. Caleb was already waiting in a corner.

"Hey." Hannah waved first.

Caleb immediately stood up, looking slightly nervous. "What would you like to drink? My treat."

Neither of them refused.

Hannah Morse: "Iced shaken lemon tea, no ice, less sugar."

Sophia Sullivan: "Large iced Americano, no sugar."

"Okay."

Caleb lowered his head to place the order on his phone.

He didn't pay directly. Instead, he opened a discount app to claim a coupon.

Returning to the payment page, the total price was instantly halved.

He discreetly observed the reactions of the two people across from him.

Sophia and Hannah remained expressionless, showing no sign of surprise.

Hannah even enthusiastically shared, "Next time, try the promotions on the bank app. They often have half-price coupons."

Clearly an old hand at this.

"Okay." Caleb nodded, his slight discomfort immediately vanishing.

While waiting for the drinks, Sophia spoke. "How have you been these past few days?"

Caleb nodded. "Pretty much as expected. I just didn't think the school would act so quickly."

Hannah snorted lightly. "With this much public pressure, how could they dare to delay? The golden window for crisis PR is only a few hours."

Sophia continued, "Have you found a new advisor yet?"

Caleb smiled wryly. He was about to answer when the order pickup alert sounded.

"One moment."

He stood up and went to the counter to retrieve the drinks.

Hannah nudged Sophia's arm, lowering her voice. "What if he's already found another lab?"

Sophia: "That would be fine too."

"But..."

"We should respect his choice."

"Right." Hannah sighed softly.

Caleb returned to the seat and handed the drinks to them.

Sophia & Hannah: "Thank you."

He sat back down. "I haven't found a new advisor yet."

Hannah's eyes lit up.

Sophia: "Would you like to come to Professor Watson's lab?"

Caleb was stunned, speechless for a moment.

"If you have other plans, just forget I asked."

Caleb took a deep breath. "Was this Professor Watson's idea?"

"Yes, she returns tomorrow morning. If you're willing, we can handle the paperwork in the afternoon."

"Why would Professor Watson..." Caleb found it hard to believe.

Sophia smiled. "Why wouldn't she? No professor dislikes excellent students."

"But no professor likes trouble either."

"Professor Watson is different. She only worries her students aren't excellent enough."

Hannah couldn't help interjecting impatiently. "Why hesitate? Professor Watson is much better than that Victoria Lowell!"

"It's not that I'm unsatisfied... It's just so sudden..." He couldn't believe such good fortune had fallen upon him.

Hannah: "So that's a yes?"

Caleb asked uncertainly, "Is it really okay?"

Sophia nodded. "Really. My teacher contacted me after seeing the news. She's returning early specifically for you."

Eleanor Watson's exact words were: This kid has had it tough. I want to help him.

Caleb's eyes reddened. "...I'm willing. Thank the Professor for me."

"Tomorrow afternoon, the Professor invites you to dinner at her home."

"Is that... appropriate?" Caleb felt somewhat flustered.

Victoria Lowell had also taken him to meals, but always at restaurants.

Going to her home was only to pick up packages or clean.

These chores only stopped once he could write papers.

Hannah laughed. "Why wouldn't it be? Marcus and I go often. Auntie's braised pork is especially delicious!"

Caleb: "...Okay."

Sophia: "The Professor's idea is for you to first focus on completing your thesis to ensure you graduate smoothly in June. We can discuss pursuing a Ph.D. afterwards."

"Although she said she wouldn't take master's students, direct advancement is an exception. Transferring to her name, a Ph.D. would count as direct advancement."

"If you don't wish to continue your studies, she supports your decision too."

Eleanor Watson had considered every possibility for him.

"...Thank the Professor." His voice choked up.

"One more thing," Sophia continued. "I read your previously published papers, including those plagiarized by Victoria Lowell. I discovered one fact—"

Caleb: "?"

"You are exceptionally talented."

A rural child with no background, testing into MIT solely on academic merit.

Independently publishing papers, creating research projects autonomously, even managing an entire lab within just two or three years.

It was like becoming a martial arts master through self-study, without a master's guidance.

Besides hard work, it required immense innate talent.

To self-educate and excel under Victoria Lowell's neglect.

There's a saying in academia: Effort determines the floor, talent determines the ceiling.

Caleb looked puzzled, unsure why she was saying this.

Sophia suddenly became serious. "So, Caleb Watson, would you be willing to join the Boundless Lab?"

Caleb was completely stunned.

He even doubted his hearing.

Hannah watched him nervously.

Sophia waited for his answer.

After a long silence, Caleb took a deep breath. "But our research focuses are different."

"Yet both fall within the scope of bioinformatics."

"You've read my papers. You know I lean more towards genetics."

"I know. Since its founding, the Boundless Lab has been positioned as a comprehensive biology laboratory."

What does comprehensive mean?

It means inclusivity. Interdisciplinary. Embracing all streams.
###Chapter 419

At the Limitless Lab, you can have your own dedicated bench.
You can propose your own research projects.
You can gradually build your own team.

My invitation is not to ask you to change your research direction to suit us.
It is to provide you with a better research environment and resources.
It will allow you to go further and broader on your academic path.

Of course, I am not a selfless saint.

Caleb Watson looked intently at Sophia Sullivan.
He asked the question he cared about most.
"What can you get from me?"

"If you join, the research results will still belong to you."
"But they must be published under the lab's name."
"This is for reputation and benefit."

"A lab that wants to grow needs academic output to secure its place in the global scientific community."
"Not just in quantity, but in quality."

"Secondly, your research direction is different from ours."
"This is precisely the opportunity for the Limitless Lab to develop comprehensively."
"We need you to enrich the lab's attributes and expand its scale."

"Finally, and most importantly."
Sophia gazed into his eyes.
"You quoted a sentence in the acknowledgments section of one paper."

"What matters is not what you possess, but what you achieve through it."
"I have the lab and the resources."
"If I just hold them in my hands, they are just cold buildings and capital for showing off."

"If I allocate a portion to you..."
"The output could be papers, glory, success."
"Even technological advancement, a leap in technology, life-saving opportunities, a stronger national defense."

"Now, about you."
"You have talent and are willing to work hard."
"You have an existing foundation."
"And you have the olive branch I'm extending."

"If you give up on academia and choose to be an ordinary worker..."
"You'd just be a highly educated workhorse."

"If you seize this opportunity..."
"Your future could be a project leader, a biologist, a young scholar."
"You might even enter the National Academy of Sciences."
"Become a researcher, a professor, even an Academician."

"Caleb, the options are laid out before you."
"Make your decision."

Hannah Morse looked at Sophia with shining eyes.
Before, she studied and took exams step by step.
Until she met Sophia.

In her, Hannah saw direction and a goal.
She finally knew where life should lead.
She was like a lighthouse, and also like sunlight.

The lighthouse showed the way.
The sunlight warmed everyone who came near her.
Like her, like Marcus Lawrence, like Caleb Watson.

Perhaps three seconds passed.
Maybe half a minute.
Caleb finally spoke.

He said, "Okay. I'll join."
Sophia smiled and extended her hand.
"Welcome."

Caleb hesitated for two seconds, then gently shook it.
"I will show you what I want to achieve."
"I look forward to it."

Hannah clapped her hands together.
"Great! Now we're all comrades-in-arms."
Caleb gave her a slight nod.

Hannah quickly added, "Welcome."
"I have one more thing," Sophia said.
"Jude Granger."

His head snapped up.
"How did you know?"
"I also know that if Ashley Lowell hadn't removed his name from the competition project..."
"You might have endured it a while longer."
"You wouldn't have suddenly exploded and reported Victoria Lowell."

Caleb lowered his gaze.
"Jude has it hard."
"None of us kids from the countryside have it easy."

"I had already become Victoria Lowell's tool."
"I didn't want to see him walk my old path."

"Even though he hasn't found a new advisor to take him in..."
"He still worried about whether I could graduate."
"He sent dozens of emails to those professors."

"I know this request is somewhat presumptuous..."
"But could he also transfer to Professor Watson's lab?"

Sophia smiled.
"Don't worry."
"Before coming here, Professor Watson said Jude would transfer over too."

"Isn't Professor Watson his idol?"
"From now on, he'll be his idol's student."

Caleb was even more excited than when he heard he was accepted.
"Excellent! That silly boy will be laughing in his dreams."

"However, one thing must be made clear."
"Please convey this to Jude as well."
"His current ability is insufficient."
"He cannot join the Limitless Lab yet."

"As long as he works hard..."
"And reaches the threshold in the future..."
"He will naturally have the opportunity to enter."

Caleb nodded.
"I understand."
"He understands too."
"He won't hold any resentment."

"Good." Sophia proactively extended her hand.
"May we work together happily."
"Charge forward for research, for academia, for dreams."

"Okay." Caleb's heart surged with emotion.

The next noon, Professor Eleanor Watson landed in Kyoto.
She didn't go home first, but went straight to the school.

She went to the academic affairs office to complete the transfer procedures for Caleb and Jude.
Then she took them both home.

Ms. Jade had already prepared the meal.
Four steaming hot dishes and a soup.

Later, Sophia heard that the two young men cried like dogs at the dinner table.
Professor Eleanor Watson couldn't help it either.
She fiercely wiped away her tears.

As the subsequent handling results were announced one after another, everything settled.
Ashley Lowell stole the research topic.

Fiona Valentine and Shane Holloway, as group members and beneficiaries, were implicated.
Shane Holloway received a major demerit, which was kept in his file.
Fiona Valentine was issued a public criticism.

Hannah was puzzled.
"Why are the punishments different for the same offense?"
Marcus Lawrence raised an eyebrow.
"Think about who Fiona Valentine's boyfriend is."

"Ah, you mean Ethan Roscente intervened to help her?"
"Otherwise?"
"Whether it's a demerit or a public criticism isn't important."
"The key is whether it goes into the file."

"Shane's did."
"Fiona's didn't?"
"If the statement doesn't mention it, then it wasn't."

"Hey, this Fiona Valentine really has some tricks up her sleeve."
"And Ethan Roscente, what is he thinking?"
"He broke up with Sophia, and now he dares to find a girlfriend among her circle."

"This isn't an attitude seeking reconciliation at all."
"He's pushing Sophia further away."
Marcus spread his hands.
"Who knows what's going on in his head?"

"Maybe he thinks by doing this he can frequently appear in front of Sophia."
"Then he can make her soften and forgive him, agree to get back together."
It had to be said, Marcus had hit the truth.

Hannah asked a soul-searching question.
"Is the thought process of you men always this bizarre?"
###Chapter 420

Marcus Lawrence frowned.
"Don't lump me in with 'you men'."

"Hmph! All crows are black under the sun!"

"I'm different from him," Marcus insisted.

Hannah Morse scoffed.
"I don't believe you."

"Want to test that theory?"

Hannah froze as Marcus turned and walked away.

She blinked.
Test what?

Fiona Valentine and Shane Holloway avoided expulsion.
But no faculty advisor would accept them.
The university had to make reluctant arrangements.

Serious academic work was out of the question.
Graduating with a diploma was their best possible outcome.

The school contacted the competition organizers.
They explained the situation and returned Sophia Sullivan's team's Grand Prize.
An official statement corrected the winner list on the website.

One scandal had unraveled many threads.

The Major Cold solar term arrived.
The year's end drew near.

Caleb Watson spent a few days in the lab.
Then he returned to his hometown with Jude Granger.

Hannah's father called, urging her home.

"Sweetie, when are you coming back?"

"The New Year is almost here. Your mother and I are heading back to Luhe soon."

"You're the eldest daughter of the main family line. You can't wait until New Year's Eve. Your uncles and granduncles won't scold you, but they'll lecture me. Have some pity on your old man!"

Hannah relented.
"Alright! I'll come back tomorrow!"

Her father was overjoyed.
"I'll have Ah Kai pick you up at the airport tomorrow!"

"No. His tattoos make him look like gangster. I'll take a taxi."

"Fine, fine. Whatever you say."

Hannah returned to Guangdong Province the next day.

With her gone, Marcus also stopped coming to the lab.
Only Sophia remained.

...

The night was deep and ink-black.

At eight, Sophia finished checking the power sources.
She locked the lab door, grabbed her bag, and left.

Her car's tire pressure was off.
The dashboard had issued a warning.
She'd sent it to the dealership with a driver that morning.

Tonight, she had to take a taxi.

She placed an order on the ride-hailing app in advance.
But the page kept showing her in a queue.

It shouldn't be this bad at this hour...

She understood once she stepped outside.

Snow had begun falling at some point.

Thick, heavy flakes swirled in the air.
Tree branches were already coated in a thick, fluffy white layer.

Sophia reached out and poked the nearest branch.
Her finger left a small dent.

It had snowed several times this winter.
But it still felt fresh and exciting.

She withdrew her red, chilled hand after playing awhile.
The app still showed no drivers had accepted her ride.

She looked up.
A snowflake landed on her eyelash.
The icy sensation made her blink, melting it instantly.

Before Hannah left yesterday, she'd said she wanted to see one more snowfall.

She hadn't expected it to happen today.

"Beep, beep—"

A strong beam of light hit her.
Sophia couldn't keep her eyes open and raised a hand to shield them.

The high beams switched to low beams.
The car pulled over and the engine cut.

The door opened.
###Chapter 421
A tall, lean figure emerged.

The man opened an umbrella and walked toward her through the swirling snow.

Against the dark night, the scene reminded Sophia of an old painting—a traveler returning on a stormy night.

As the figure drew nearer, Sophia blinked and recognized Alexander Laurent.

He stopped before her, holding the umbrella to shield her from the snow.

"Professor, what are you doing here?"

"I had an academic conference. When I came out, it was snowing. I remembered you didn't have your car, so I came by on my way."

His voice was calm and gentle.
The snowy night should have felt cold.
But the faint warmth in his eyes softened the chill.

He glanced down at her phone.
A soft, resigned sigh escaped him.
"Cancel the order. I'll take you home."

Take you home...

A faint warmth stirred in Sophia's heart.
A smile touched her eyes.
"Okay."

...

Warm air filled the car, instantly chasing away the cold.

Alexander glanced at her bright red fingers.
He didn't need to guess.

"Playing in the snow?"

Sophia stayed silent.

A regular detective, huh?

Seeing she wouldn't answer, he didn't press.
"The thermos has ginger and jujube brown sugar tea. There are disposable cups in the compartment. Have some to warm up."

The thermos stood in the cup holder next to the handbrake.
Sophia unscrewed the cap.
Steam rose, carrying the sweet scent of brown sugar.

A few goji berries floated on the surface.
A stronger whiff brought the sharp tang of ginger.

Sophia knew how to make ginger tea.
She often made it for Ethan Roscente.
But she never liked the taste of ginger herself.

"...It's not convenient in the car. I might spill it. I'll drink it later."

She said this while screwing the cap back on.

Alexander chuckled softly.
"I added extra brown sugar. It doesn't taste bad."

"It's not that it tastes bad... I just want to drink it later! Yes, later!"

"If you hadn't emphasized that last part, I might have believed you."

Sophia had no retort.

"Acting like a child now?"

"Am not."

Amusement sparkled in Alexander's eyes.
"You don't like ginger?"

"No."

"Less ginger, more sugar. It's not spicy."

Sophia looked at him doubtfully.
"Really?"

"Try it."

"Fine." She pulled out a paper cup and poured a small amount.

Alexander watched her careful portioning with a slight smile.

Sophia took a tiny sip.
Sweet, but the ginger's bite was unmistakable.
"..."
She'd been tricked.

She still finished what she'd poured.
But her expression betrayed her struggle.

Alexander was amused.
"Your reaction makes it seem worse than medicine."

Sophia was curious.
"Professor, did you make this?"

"Yes."

"Do you have a cold?"

"...No."

And then?

There was no 'then'.

He made it, but he wasn't sick.
So it wasn't for him.

Who it was for went without saying.

Alexander looked ahead.
"It's snowing again."

"Yeah." Sophia gazed out the window.
The snow on the branches had thickened, like little white puffballs.

Alexander asked another question.
"Where are you spending New Year's Eve?"

"Kyoto. My parents are both coming."

"The Atlante residence?"

"Mm. It's the first New Year since Mom reunited with her parents. She definitely wants to spend it with them."

Isabella Sullivan was coming to Kyoto for the New Year.
Would David Sullivan stay behind in the other city?

The answer was obvious.

...

The next day, the snow lay thick on the ground.

As Sophia went downstairs, she couldn't resist a clean, untouched patch...
and started rolling a snowball.

She hadn't brought any tools downstairs, specifically to avoid playing.
Yet here she was...

Sigh.

If she knew she couldn't resist the temptation, she should have brought them.
Going back up now was too much trouble.

Luckily, rolling snowballs didn't require tools. Just her hands.

The snowball reached the size of a basketball before cracking cleanly in half.

Undaunted, Sophia tried again.

This one fell apart into a crumbly mess before reaching basketball size.

"Hiss... I refuse to believe this..."

She muttered under her breath.

A low chuckle sounded from behind her...
Sophia Sullivan turned around.

Alexander Laurent stood behind her.

He had a faint smile in his eyes.

His gaze swept over the powdery snow debris on the ground.

His smile deepened.

"Playing in the snow again?"

Sophia: "Mm-hmm."

"Trying to make a snowball?"

"...Failed."

"I'll teach you." Alexander rolled up his sleeves.

Sophia's eyes lit up. "You know how?"

"Grasp the physics, and it's not difficult."

"Snowballs involve physics?" Sophia asked curiously. "What principle?"

Alexander picked up a handful of snow.

"First, pack a small, tight snowball."

"Initial rolling requires an external force to propel it."

"As the snowball's volume increases, pressure lowers the melting point of the snow, creating liquid water."

"The liquid water adheres to the snowball's surface."

"During rolling, it lifts from the ground, and the water refreezes into snow."

"This cycle repeats, and the snowball grows larger."

Sophia: "?"

Alexander: "Why that look?"

"Easier said than done," she retorted, raising an eyebrow.

"Then watch."

Alexander was brimming with confidence.

Five minutes later—

Sophia bit her lip hard.

Holding back laughter was so difficult!

Alexander stared at the scattered snow in his hands.

A look of utter disbelief crossed his face.

"It worked last time..."

Sophia blinked. "When was 'last time'?"

Alexander pondered for a moment.

"...Maybe ten? Or eleven."

Sophia: "..."

She couldn't hold it in any longer.

"Ha ha ha..." She burst out laughing.

Alexander: "..."

Epic fail.

A massive crash and burn.

They had spent over forty minutes downstairs.

Sophia checked the time.

"I have to go."

She dashed off and disappeared.

Alexander walked into the lab, thoroughly annoyed.

He finished two sets of data.

But he still couldn't forget the snowball.

He got up and went to the break room.

On his way back, he passed Professor Quincy Evans's workstation.

He stopped.

Then took a few steps back.

Quincy was focused on his experiment.

He jumped, startled by the sudden presence.

"Whoa! Are you trying to scare someone to death?"

"Ahem." Alexander cleared his throat lightly.

"What's up?" Quincy took off his safety goggles.

Alexander: "Do you know how to make a snowball?"

Quincy: "Huh?"

A new physics problem?

Spherical motion? Surface tension?

His mind raced through possibilities in two seconds.

Alexander gestured. "Just, rolling a snowball."

Quincy finally understood.

"Why are you asking? New lab evaluation?"

Alexander: "Be serious."

Quincy was baffled. "Who from up north doesn't? You don't?"

Alexander: "..."

"You really don't?"

"..."

"What do you want?" Quincy crossed his arms.

Alexander: "The snow is thick outside."

"So?"

"Teach me how to make a snowball."

"???" Quincy wondered if he was hearing things.

The workaholic wanted to skip work to play in the snow?

"Do I look like a snowball to you?"

"..."

Quincy laughed in disbelief. "You're serious? Play in the snow during work hours?"

Alexander: "Yes. And teach me."

His attitude was firm.

Quincy suddenly had an epiphany.

Sophia was from the south.

Southerners love snow.

"I can teach you," Quincy grinned. "But I still have two experiments to finish."

Alexander: "I'll do them."

Quincy: "! Really?"

"What do you think?"

Quincy's eyes shifted. "One more condition."

Alexander's face darkened. "Say it all at once."

"Combine my annual leave with New Year's Eve."

Alexander: "Pushing your luck."

"Three seconds to decide. Three, two, one—"

"Deal!"

"Let's go~ Play in the snow~"

Forty minutes later—

Quincy: "Not like that! Like this... this..."

After the nth demonstration: "Get it now?"

"Mm-hmm."

Another half hour passed—

Quincy: "Forget the deal. Can we just stop?"

Alexander: "No. Continue."

Quincy pleaded patiently. "What's the use of knowing how to make a snowball? Will little Sophia like you for it?"

"Doesn't matter. Must learn."

It was the first time Quincy saw Alexander so stubborn.

And failing spectacularly at a elementary school skill.

How novel!

After the n+1th failure.

Quincy's patience snapped: "I quit! This is impossible!"

Perfect snowballs littered the ground by his feet.

Alexander's area was piled with snow dust.

He still said: "Again."

Quincy: "?"

Alex, don't love this too much
###Chapter 422

While Alexander Laurent was rolling snowballs in the snow, Sophia Sullivan was alone in the lab recording data.

Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence had both gone home for the New Year holiday.

She was the only one left in the lab.

She was so used to Hannah's constant chatter that it felt strange when she first walked in this morning.

But once she stood at the lab bench and started working, that feeling quickly disappeared.

Sophia was never afraid of being alone.

Those years Ethan Roscente kept her trapped in the Beverly Hills mansion, she had grown accustomed to solitude.

Reading alone.

Studying alone.

Cooking alone.

Eating alone.

Waiting alone.

Academic work could be done collaboratively, but it could also be a solitary exploration.

This was a truth she had understood long ago.

At noon, Sophia rubbed her sore neck and walked into the break room.

She took her lunchbox from her bag and heated it in the microwave.

She scrolled through her social media feed while eating lunch.

She suddenly saw a post from Professor Quincy Evans an hour ago—

Caption: So sick of rolling.

The attached picture showed three neat rows of snowballs arranged on the snow.

Three rows!

It was indeed impressive.

Sophia liked the post first, then left a comment:

[Prof. Q 666]

Quincy Evans replied instantly: [The 6 isn't me [smile]]

A few minutes later, he added another comment: [I think it's not 6, it's for iPhone]

Sophia didn't understand: [??]

Quincy didn't reply again.

For iPhone?

What did that mean?

She didn't think too much about it. After finishing lunch and taking a short break, she returned to the lab bench.

It got dark early in winter. Sophia didn't take a nap.

She was afraid she wouldn't be able to get up if she lay down, and she also wanted to finish the experiment early and go home.

Everything went smoothly today. She took a taxi home at 4 p.m.

Just as she entered the alley, she saw two children building a snowman in front of the next building.

It looked quite lively.

It had a nose and eyes, a red scarf, and a stainless steel colander on its head as a hat.

It was properly done.

Sophia couldn't help but stop and watch the children pile crushed snow onto the snowman.

Soon the snowman's belly became round and full.

...

When Alexander entered the alley, he saw Sophia watching the two children.

Her expression was more focused than when she was conducting experiments.

She didn't even notice him walking up behind her.

"Do you like it that much?"

Sophia turned her head sharply, then her eyes curved into smiles the next second. "Professor, you're back too?"

"Mm, efficient today."

Not only did he collected two sets of data., but he also learned how to roll snowballs.

Couldn't that be considered efficient?

Sophia pointed at the nearly finished snowman. "It's so pretty. These kids are amazing."

The two children turned at the sound of her voice and enthusiastically invited her. "Miss, come play!"

Sophia quickly waved her hands. "No, no, you play. I don't know how. I'll just watch."

Once the snowman was finished, the children were called home for dinner by their parents—

"Goodbye, Miss."

Then they politely waved to Alexander. "Bye, Uncle~"

After saying that, they skipped away.

"Sophia." Alexander suddenly called her name.

"Hm?" She turned to look at him.

"Let's roll snowballs! I was unstable this morning, but I can definitely do it this time! Northerners grow up playing in the snow. We can do anything."

Alexander never expected that the first time he ever boasted in his life wouldn't be about his academic ability, but about his skill at playing in the snow.

Sophia looked at him, her eyes shining. "Really?!"

"Come on, let's roll a big snowball."

As he spoke, he was already rolling up his sleeves, eager to start.

"Professor, let's not roll snowballs. Let's build a snowman instead! Okay?"

Alexander was stunned.

"You said you can do anything, right? Building a snowman is good. Let's build one even bigger than this..." Sophia didn't bother to look at the man's expression. She spoke while scooping up snow, starting to work following the steps she saw the children use.

She didn't hear Alexander's voice for a while. Sophia stopped and looked up at him.

"Professor?"

"...Build a snowman?"

"Mmhmm!" Sophia's eyes were bright.

"...Okay." He squatted down.

Although things weren't developing as he had imagined, it wasn't something he couldn't try.

And the result of the attempt...

Sophia looked at the two misshapen lumps of snow in front of her. They were barely stacked together, neither round nor square, and top-heavy!

Forget a nose and eyes, it didn't even have a basic shape.

You couldn't tell what it was supposed to be.

If she had to describe it, well... two lumps.

Sophia looked at Alexander, her expression complicated.

The latter awkwardly rubbed his nose. "Well... seems my performance is unstable again."

Sophia: "...It's okay."

The more she tried to make excuses for him, the more mortified he felt.

"It's getting late... and it's quite cold out. Should we go home?"

Alexander: "...Okay."

One boast led to a lifetime of introversion.

They went upstairs and entered their respective apartments.

Sophia had just entered her living room. Two seconds of silence later—

"Ahahahahahaha..."

Sorry, she really couldn't hold it in anymore.

On the other side, Alexander closed his door, sat on the sofa, immediately took out his phone, opened the messaging app, and found Quincy Evans.

[Why didn't you teach me how to build a snowman?]

[Didn't you say you could do anything?]

Quincy Evans: [???]

Alexander: [Teach me how to build a snowman tomorrow.]

Quincy Evans: [WTF?!]

[Can I just forfeit my vacation?]

Alexander: [Sure. Does that mean you don't want your doubled year-end bonus either?]

Quincy Evans: [Shocked]

Alexander: [Okay, canceled.]

Quincy Evans: [! Don't say snowman, I could even teach you to build a snow elephant!]

Putting down his phone, Quincy happily threw himself onto the bed, rolling around like a wild donkey!

"Double! Ahahahaha! Double!"

The next day, he got up early and rushed to the lab. After making all the preparations, he finally realized—

The snow had melted?

Melted?!

He exchanged a look with Alexander, who had also arrived early.

"Alex, you see... it's not that I'm unwilling to teach, right?"

Alexander didn't speak.

"What about the year-end double..."

"Gone."

"...!"

On her way to the lab, Sophia glanced at the remnants of snow by the roadside and couldn't help muttering, "How did it melt so quickly?"

Suddenly her phone rang. It was a landline number.

She answered. "Hello?"

"It's me."

It was Sebastian Evans's voice.

"Yeah, I know." She recognized it.

His mood suddenly sounded much better. "Grandma made something delicious today. Come over for a meal? I'll drive to pick you up."

"But I'm already on my way to the lab. How about tonight? Tell Grandma and Grandpa I'll come for dinner."

"What about lunch?"

"I'll order takeout." She woke up late today and didn't have time to make lunch.

Sebastian: "How about this: I'll bring lunch to you at noon, and you can come over for dinner."

"No, no, that's too much trouble!"

"It's no trouble. It's settled then."
###Chapter 423

Sophia Sullivan was about to politely decline.

Sebastian Evans spoke softly.

"Grandmother prepared this specially. Don't disappoint her."

Sophia immediately found she couldn't refuse.

At half past eleven, Sebastian arrived right on time.

Sophia went to the entrance to greet him personally.

"You didn't need to come out. I could have found my way in."

"You wouldn't have been able to get in."

After passing through multiple identity verification checkpoints, Sebastian understood what she meant.

"The security is much stricter than before?"

He had been here on the day of the unveiling ceremony. His memory was that it wasn't this complicated.

Sophia nodded. "I readjusted the security levels."

"A requirement from above?"

"Not entirely. But it's better to be cautious."

Sebastian expressed his understanding.

"Brother, isn't the company busy? You still made a special trip to deliver food."

"No matter how busy, I had to come. It's a task Grandmother assigned."

"What task?"

They walked into the living area.

Sebastian opened the insulated bag and took out two thermal containers.

The food was still steaming hot.

He laid out the dishes one by one, then took out the utensils.

"The task is to supervise you until you finish every last bite."

Sophia looked at the table full of dishes. Six full courses and soup, all her favorite flavors.

"It smells amazing…"

Sebastian chuckled lightly. "Grandmother has been studying cookbooks every day recently. She said she's afraid her skills have gotten rusty after so many years out of the kitchen. She's been practicing on Grandfather and me."

"Grandfather says we're all benefiting because of you."

Sophia couldn't help but laugh. "How is that true? But there's so much…" She looked at the dining table. "I really can't finish all this."

A thought suddenly occurred to her—

"Brother, have you eaten yet?"

Sebastian paused slightly. "Not yet. Grandmother was afraid of delaying your meal. She made me leave at ten."

Sophia: "…"

This was far too biased.

Fortunately, Sebastian was broad-minded and never计较 these things.

"Eat together then. There's no way I can finish all this by myself. Let's not waste it."

"I only brought one set of chopsticks."

Sophia handed the chopsticks to him.

"Then what will you use?"

"A spoon is fine for me."

They sat facing each other.

Halfway through the meal, Sophia received a door access request notification.

"Who would come at this time?"

She picked up her tablet and opened the surveillance feed.

"Professor?" She was somewhat surprised.

Sebastian's motion of picking up food with his chopsticks halted. "Alexander Laurent?"

"Yes."

Sophia directly approved the request and activated the voice function. "Professor, you may enter."

"Alright. Are you in the lab area?"

"In the living area. Come straight here."

Two minutes later, Alexander Laurent appeared at the entrance to the living area.

He saw the two of them having their meal.

Sophia stood up to greet him. "Professor."

"Mr. Evans is here too? What a coincidence." Alexander's gaze turned to Sebastian.

Just then, Sebastian also looked up at him.

Their eyes met. The air instantly grew still.

"Would you care to join us, Professor Laurent?" Sebastian was the first to speak.

"Thank you…"

He was clearly about to refuse.

Sebastian thought, at least he knows what's appropriate.

But the next second—

"I haven't had lunch yet, actually."

Alexander calmly accepted the invitation.

Sebastian's eyes darkened slightly. "Apologies, but we don't have any extra utensils."

"There are disposable utensils in the cabinet." Sophia stood up to go get them.

She left in an instant.

Alexander sat down opposite Sebastian, his eyes sweeping over the full table of dishes. "Quite a spread. It looks good."

Sebastian gave a light laugh. "Is the lab not busy, Professor Laurent? You have time to come for a meal?"

"Not pushing any deadlines at the end of the year. It's relatively quiet. As for joining the meal… It would be impolite to refuse your kind offer, Mr. Evans."

Sebastian: "…"

"Though you, Mr. Evans, must be very busy at the group at year's end? You found the time to come?"

"Bringing Sophia a meal. I'll always make time, no matter how busy."

Alexander smiled faintly, seemingly unconcerned about the term of address.

Sebastian frowned, then decided to be direct.

"Alexander Laurent, are you in love with Sophia Sullivan?"

Though phrased as a question, his tone was utterly certain.

Alexander countered with a question of his own. "And what is your身份 for asking this? An ordinary man? Or her brother?"

Sebastian was taken aback. "She even told you that?"

Alexander: "That statement makes me even more certain you were deliberately misleading me before."

Sebastian neither confirmed nor denied it.

"You didn't ask clearly yourself. Who can you blame?"

Alexander's gaze was sharp. "How does Mr. Evans view his relationship with Sophia Sullivan? Is it something you find difficult to talk about? Is that why you intentionally let people misunderstand?"

The corner of Sebastian's mouth lifted slightly. "So you really did misunderstand? You thought Sophia and I were together? But what does that have to do with you, Professor Laurent? Why do you care so much? What's the reason?"

The question circled back to the beginning—

Alexander Laurent, are you in love with Sophia Sullivan?

Sebastian: "You don't have to answer. But there's no need to change the subject."

Alexander: "You haven't answered me—"

What身份 are you asking this question with?

Sebastian: "Does the answer differ based on those two identities?"

"Of course." Alexander's expression was calm. "If it's as an ordinary man, I have no obligation to answer an overstepping question. We are not close."

Sebastian: "…"

"But if you are asking as her cousin, as her family, I will tell you truthfully."

Sebastian narrowed his eyes. "You are in love with her."

"Yes." Alexander admitted frankly, his gaze clear. "I am in love with her."

Sebastian felt a surge of anger. Suppressing his fury, he sneered. "You finally admit it!"

Alexander seemed slightly puzzled. "Is being in love with someone something difficult to talk about?"

Sebastian was momentarily speechless.

In that moment, he actually felt a trace of envy for Alexander Laurent.

He envied his ability to speak his heart aloud.

He envied that his love was so open and bright.
###Chapter 424

He could tell at a glance it wasn't the first time.

Alexander Laurent met his gaze openly.
"I like her."
"It's out in the open."
"I have nothing to hide."

Sebastian Evans clenched his fists.
He felt defeated for the first time.

"Does Sophia Sullivan know?"

Alexander remained calm.
"I've tested the waters."
"She said she's not considering romance for now."
"Her studies come first."

Sebastian scoffed.
"So, you got rejected?"

"Not exactly." Alexander gave him a cool glance.
"I haven't formally confessed."

Sebastian's smile widened.

Alexander frowned.
"What's so funny?"

"You are."

"Is that so?" Alexander's tone was even.
"Just because I have no chance now doesn't mean I never will."
"But you—you have no chance, now or ever."

Sebastian froze instantly.

"The utensils are here!" Sophia returned with the tableware.

Both men fell silent simultaneously.

Their tacit understanding was astonishing in that moment.

The grandmother had prepared plenty of food.
There was enough for Alexander too.

Sophia warmly urged him.
"Professor, please help yourself."
"Try my grandmother's signature shredded pork in Beijing sauce."
"The sweet and sour ribs are also excellent..."

"You must try the fermented glutinous rice balls!"
"They're stuffed with minced meat and mushrooms."

Alexander tasted everything as suggested.
His cooperation was perfect.

"The sauce is rich but not greasy. Quite impressive."
"The mushrooms in the balls are very fresh, with a hint of sourness?"

Sophia was surprised.
"Professor, your palate is too sharp!"
"Grandmother习惯 dips her fingers in vinegar while shaping the balls."
"She says it enhances the freshness."

Alexander smiled.
"It's all delicious."
"I'm fortunate today..."

Sebastian watched their natural interaction.
His heart sank continuously.

After the meal, Sophia cleared the table.
Alexander washed the lunchbox.

They had a clear division of labor.
They worked together without needing to communicate.

Sebastian saw it clearly.
This was definitely not the first time.

He gritted his teeth, his jaw tight.

"Sophia, something urgent came up at the company. I have to go..."

"Okay." Sophia nodded.
"Be careful on the road."

Sebastian turned and left.

After cleaning up, Sophia brewed two glasses of iced tea with lemon.

When she brought them out, Alexander wasn't in the living area.

She put the glasses down and walked towards the lab.

The man was standing at the lab bench.
He was reviewing the data she had organized that morning.

"...Professor?" Sophia called out softly.

Alexander turned around.
He pointed at the data with a smile.
"The accuracy rate is very high."

The corners of Sophia's lips lifted slightly.
"Can we skip the recheck step then?"

"Theoretically, no."
"But considering the time cost, we could."

He had already checked it.
It was fine.

"We should still do it," Sophia shook her head.
"Even though you guarantee it's fine, we can't skip procedures."
"It sets an example for someone."

"An example?"

"Yes."

Alexander was curious.
"Is there a story?"

"More of an incident." Sophia's eyes brightened slightly.
"We skipped the recheck once and missed a decimal point."

"Hannah was responsible for that data."
"She was almost崩溃 at the time."

Alexander was drawn in by her expression.
"What happened after?"

"Marcus retrieved the data."
"He stayed up two nights correcting and resubmitting it."

Hannah lost seven pounds those two days.
She shed a lot of hair.

Marcus made an exception and gave her three days off.
He didn't push her to run anymore.

"Did you come today for something, Professor?"

Alexander nodded.
He took a USB drive from his pocket.

"The obscure literature you requested on that topic is all here."

Sophia was delighted.
"So fast?"

"I asked a friend abroad to find it."
"It's easier than finding it domestically."

"Thank you."
"I owe you again."

"No need to repay."

"How can that be?"

Alexander chuckled lightly.
"That meal just now already covered it."
"Your grandmother's cooking—I came out ahead."

Alexander didn't leave for the entire afternoon.

Sophia asked if he didn't need to return to his lab.

He said, "I'm on vacation."

So that was it...

Sophia conducted her experiments.
Alexander worked on his paper not far away.

The quiet lab area was filled with two people, each busy and equally focused.

By the time Sophia finished, it was almost five.

"Are you heading home?"

Sophia packed her things.
"I'm having dinner at my grandmother's tonight."

Alexander knew she hadn't driven.
He closed his laptop.
"I'll drive you."

...

"It's past six. Why isn't Sophia here yet?"

Florence Atlante stood by the door, constantly checking the time.
She looked towards the gate.

Isaac Atlante said, "Don't worry."
"Sebastian said Sophia promised to come. She will."

The old lady nodded.
"That child keeps her word."

"Must you pace? Can't you sit and wait?"

Florence said, "Sebastian said the company wasn't busy this morning."
"He dropped off a meal and suddenly had an emergency?"
"Letting Sophia come on her own... We should have sent a driver!"

Isaac said, "Who can predict emergencies?"
"Sophia isn't a child."

The old lady didn't listen at all.
She kept muttering about Sebastian being unreliable.

"You're unreliable too!"

Isaac: "?"

What did he do?

Florence said, "All you know is fiddling with your tea leaves. It's annoying to watch!"

Isaac: "???"

Just then, the sound of an engine came from outside the gate...

"She's here!"
###Chapter 425

The doorbell rang.

The elderly lady hurried to open the door.

Sophia Sullivan stood outside.

A young man was beside her.

He was tall and carried a cool, reserved air.

The elderly couple exchanged a glance.

Florence Atlante's eyes swept over Alexander Laurent.

She smiled at her granddaughter. "Sophia, who is this?"

Sophia was about to speak.

Alexander stepped forward. "Grandma, Grandpa, hello. My name is Alexander Laurent."

His tone was steady and polite.

Isaac Atlante raised an eyebrow. "The Laurent family's boy?"

"Yes." Alexander gave a slight nod.

"Frederick Laurent is your father?"

"My father intended to pay his respects personally. I simply beat him to it."

Isaac studied him. "The third son? The one in physics?"

A faint smile touched Alexander's lips. "Yes."

The elderly lady's eyes lit up. "In the same field as Sophia?"

Isaac chuckled. "How else do you think they met?"

The old  woman immediately beamed.

She had a natural fondness for academic high achievers.

"Alexander, it's so late and you brought Sophia home. Would you like to stay for dinner?"

Alexander had only intended to say hello.

He hadn't expected a dinner invitation.

He hesitated slightly. "Wouldn't that be an imposition?"

"Not at all! Not at all!" The old  woman waved her hands dismissively. "It's so dark out. I worry about Sophia coming home alone. It's good you brought her back. This is actually the first time she's brought a friend home."

Sophia couldn't help but laugh.

She sounded just like a kindergarten parent.

She looked at Alexander. "Grandma's right. Stay for dinner. I can hitch a ride back with you later."

Alexander stopped refusing.

He had just sat down.

The old man hadn't even finished brewing the tea.

Another engine sound came from outside.

Sebastian Evans pushed the door open.

He was taking off his shoes as he asked, "Is Sophia here? Do I need to go pick her up?"

Isaac laughed jovially. "She's already here."

Sebastian's movements halted.

He looked up and saw Alexander.

His face instantly darkened.

The old  woman didn't notice, still excitedly introducing him. "Sebastian, come here. This is Sophia's friend, Alex—"

"Grandma, we know each other," Sebastian interrupted her.

His voice carried a chill.

"You know each other? Even better! You young people chat. I'll go check on the food in the kitchen." The old  woman finished and headed towards the kitchen.

Sebastian sat on the sofa.

His gaze collided with Alexander's.

He immediately looked away.

Alexander also had no intention of making conversation.

They sat far apart.

Sophia didn't notice any of this.

She brought up the family's collection of physics books.

Alexander immediately became interested.

They chatted intently.

Sebastian couldn't get a word in.

He took out his tablet to handle some work.

But his attention kept being drawn away.

Watching Sophia's radiant smile.

Watching Alexander speak with ease.

In the kitchen.

The old  woman didn't actually have much to do.

The ingredients were prepped, just waiting to be cooked.

Isaac had followed her in to keep her company.

The old  woman shot him a look. "You don't know how to cook. What are you doing in here?"

"Keeping you company," the old man said with a laugh.

"Old man, what do you think of young Alexander? Handsome, polite, good family background. The Laurents have a upright reputation. Never any messy scandals."

Isaac was puzzled. "Why bring that up? But he does seem like a fine young man."

The old  woman glanced toward the living room. "Do you think he and Sophia…"

"Don't let your imagination run wild! They're just friends."

"I'm not imagining things. Whether they're friends or more, we still have to vet him for Sophia, right?"

"Sophia's a grown woman. She knows how to handle her friendships. Let's not interfere."

"I know, I know. Just a private assessment."

"Fine. Just don't say anything to make Sophia uncomfortable."

The old  woman pouted. "Do I seem that tactless to you?"

Isaac quickly shook his head. "No, no."

"Hey, don't you think Sebastian seems in a bad mood?"

Isaac frowned. "Does he?"

"He came in with a dark expression, hasn't said a word, just buried in work. He radiates displeasure."

"Maybe work isn't going well. Men his age are building their careers. A little pressure is normal."

The old  woman sighed softly. "I hope that's all it is."

...

Dinner was served.

Alexander noticed two dishes he particularly liked on the table.

The old  woman smiled. "Sophia said you prefer light flavors. I made these specially. See if they suit your taste."

Her cooking skills were, naturally, excellent.

Alexander proved it with his appetite.

Florence watched happily, continuously serving him more food.

The food in his bowl piled up like a small mountain.

Alexander looked helplessly at Sophia for assistance.

Sophia cleared her throat lightly. "Grandma, we can serve ourselves. You should eat too."

"Okay, okay."

The old  woman agreed verbally, but her hands didn't stop.

She just slowed her pace a little.

Alexander finally breathed a sigh of relief.

"Sebastian, this is your favorite—" The old  woman served Sebastian some food.

Sebastian sounded resigned. "Grandma, I'm not a child. I can serve myself."

"In my eyes, you're all children."

Sebastian and Alexander's eyes met.

A second later, they each looked away.

Alexander was gentle and polite, winning the elders' favor.

From the meal until his departure, the elderly couple were exceptionally warm.

They even saw him to the door when he left.

They urged him to visit often.

Alexander agreed with a smile.

Sophia stood by his side. "Grandma, Grandpa, I'm heading back now."

"Be careful on the road. Thank you for your trouble, Alexander."

"No trouble at all." The corner of Alexander's mouth lifted slightly. "It's my pleasure."

Sebastian stood behind the elderly couple.

Keeping his distance.

He watched this scene heavily.

Warm and harmonious.

As if they were the family.

Sebastian suddenly felt...

a little wronged.

Why?

What right did Alexander Laurent have?
###Chapter 426

Sophia Sullivan didn't stop her experiments until Little New Year's Eve.

She finally caught her breath three days before New Year's Eve.

David Sullivan and Isabella Sullivan came to Kyoto from the neighboring city.

The couple had long decided to spend the New Year with Isaac Atlante and Florence Atlante.

Somehow David convinced his parents and elder brother.
He ended up following Isabella north.

They were supposed to leave half a month earlier.
But Isabella suddenly went into seclusion for her writing.
Then she went to G City for a book signing.
The trip kept getting delayed.

Early in the morning, Sophia drove to the high-speed rail station.

The Spring Festival travel rush was in full swing.
She waited over ten minutes before spotting her parents.

"Dad! Mom!"

She jumped up and waved.

Isabella wore a red coat.
Her posture was erect.
She stood out in the crowd.

David pushed the luggage cart.
His arms were laden with bags.

Isabella only carried a small handbag.
She looked elegant, like a noblewoman on vacation.

At first glance, she resembled a young lady with her elderly butler.

But in reality—

"Let me carry some," Isabella reached out again.

David sidestepped. "No need. I can handle this myself."

He even lifted the bags to show it was effortless.

Isabella insisted. "I want to carry something."

David shook his head. "No."

"No..."

"No..."

Sophia approached while her parents were still arguing.

She tentatively offered, "Should I help Dad with some?"

They both nodded simultaneously.

Sophia: "..."

In the end, she ended up carrying everything.

The parking lot was spacious.
The family of three could finally talk.

Isabella hadn't seen her daughter in a long time.
Her longing overflowed.

She touched Sophia's face and delivered the classic mother line: "You seem thinner?"

"Grandma makes delicious food every day. I've clearly gained weight." Sophia laughed and linked arms with her mother.

Mentioning Florence Atlante softened Isabella's eyes. "How are your grandparents' health?"

Back in the neighboring city, she noticed her mother's eyes were sensitive to wind.
They teared up with both cold and heat.

So when the elderly couple suggested returning to the capital, she didn't object.

The environment in the capital was more familiar.
The medical facilities were better.

She didn't stop them, but she always worried.

Sophia: "Grandma takes herbal medicine daily and combines it with acupuncture. Her eyes are much better. She can see more and more clearly."

"That's good." Isabella breathed a sigh of relief.

David rubbed his hands. "It's cold outside. Let's get in the car first. Your grandparents are waiting."

"Okay."

On the way, Sophia was still curious how her father had convinced her grandparents.

How did he get the old traditionalists to agree to their son and daughter-in-law celebrating the New Year away from home?
It was simply unbelievable!

David mumbled a few vague sentences.
He didn't want to elaborate.

Sophia didn't press further.

...

The Atlante family home.

Isaac and Florence had started the deep cleaning a week ago.

The house was spotless inside and out.

Isabella's room was redecorated.
The single bed was replaced with a double.

A special area was set aside next to the sunroom.
Flower pots and soil were prepared for David to grow his potted plants.

Lanterns, couplets, and "Fu" character decorations were all in place.
The New Year atmosphere was strong.

Early in the morning, the elderly couple put on brand new Tang suits.
They waited spiritedly for their daughter and son-in-law.

"What time is it?" the old lady asked.

Isaac checked his watch. "Just past 11."

"Almost there. They arrived at the station after ten. They should be here soon. Are the slippers ready?"

The housekeeper nodded. "Everything is prepared."

"Is the tea cold?" The old man was uneasy.

"It's still warm."

"Warm isn't good enough! Tea should be scalding hot to taste best! Pour it out and make a fresh pot."

"Okay."

The old lady remembered something. "Don't cut the fruit yet. Wait until they arrive to keep it fresh."

"Okay."

"Is the living room tidy?"

"Was the restroom cleaned again this morning?"

"How are the preparations in the kitchen?"

...

The elderly couple repeatedly checked everything.
They finally heard the car engine signaling Isabella and David's arrival.

"They're here! They're here!"

Isabella and David walked through the door side by side.

The old man and old lady stood in the foyer.
They watched their daughter and son-in-law approach hand in hand.
Their granddaughter followed closely behind—

They had waited decades for this moment.

Their wish was finally fulfilled.

...

Lunch was meticulously prepared by the old lady.

Every dish was a favorite of David, Isabella, and Sophia.

"Isabella, try this... you used to love it... and this... these..."

The old lady smiled at her daughter, unable to get enough of looking at her.

"Mom," Isabella said helplessly, "stop serving me. You and Dad should eat too!"

"Yes! We are eating, we are eating!"

Isaac nodded. "We know. You eat more. David too, and Sophia..."

"Thank you, Dad." David ate while praising. "Mom's cooking is wonderful. Every dish is delicious."

The old lady's eyes sparkled. "If it's good, eat more!"

"Okay. You should start eating too!"

"Yes!"

The elderly couple picked up their chopsticks.
They didn't eat much.
They were too busy watching their daughter and son-in-law.

Isabella found it amusing.

Finally, Sophia stood up—

She served a piece of braised pork to each of the elderly. "Grandpa, Grandma, if you keep staring at my mom, she's going to get embarrassed."

"Ahem! Okay, okay, we'll stop looking. Let's eat, let's eat!"

Isaac quickly picked up his braised pork.

The old lady reluctantly withdrew her gaze.

If looks could solidify, her gaze at that moment would be stickier than spider silk and sweeter than honey.
###Chapter 427

After lunch, the elderly lady led Isabella and David into the freshly arranged room.

"This was Isabella's room. Now it's your bridal suite."

"The bed is new, and the linens were just sun-dried."

She had personally maintained this room for years, never letting it change.

From the furniture to the small trinkets, everything remained exactly as it was.

She never allowed anyone else to clean it.

Even while abroad, she returned every six months just to tidy it herself.

She guarded it like a precious treasure, preserving its original state.

Just as expected—

The moment Isabella stepped inside, memories flooded back.

From childhood innocence to teenage secrets, and the first flutterings of young love…

This room held her entire youth.

Suddenly, blurred fragments flashed through her mind—

A shattered vase. A dim corner. A bloodied blade. And… a woman's tear-streaked face.

"Isabella? What's wrong?" David noticed her change immediately.

The elderly lady hurried over. "Are you feeling unwell? Let me open a window."

Cold air rushed in, jolting Isabella back to awareness.

"It's nothing… just a bit dizzy." She waved a pale hand. "I'm fine now."

The elderly lady checked再三 before leaving.

"Rest well after your journey," she reminded them before closing the door.

David saw her out, then returned to Isabella's side.

"What happened just now?"

His wife couldn't hide anything from him.

She leaned against him on the edge of the bed. "I think… I remembered something."

"What did you remember?"

"But it's still so vague…"

David sighed softly, placing a hand on her shoulder. "Don't force it. It will come back when the time is right."

"Yes."

Isabella nodded, slowly releasing a breath.

David's gaze fell on the opposite wall cabinet, filled with various certificates, medals, and trophies.

"My wife was this outstanding?"

Vocal music, dance, piano, chess, competitions…

"Is there anything you couldn't do?"

Through these honors, he could almost see the younger Isabella—the girl he never knew but always admired.

"Of course! I wouldn't say I mastered everything, but I had my talents."

David marveled, "What luck did I have to marry a goddess? This backstory would make you the female lead in one of your novels, right?"

Isabella shook her head. "Not even close. My male leads are either serial killers, reclusive detectives, or mentally unstable patients."

"…"

Isabella stood and looked around the familiar room, feeling a sense of peace.

They had spent the morning on the subway and were tired, so they lay down for a nap.

When Isabella woke, she found David browsing an old photo album.

His expression was focused, his gaze tender.

She crept closer, hoping to startle him.

But the man didn't even turn his head. "Aren't you a little old for games like that?"

Isabella was surprised. "How did you know I was awake?"

David chuckled, pointing at the wall ahead. "Your shadow gave you away."

Isabella glanced at the wall and felt foolish.

She cleared her throat, changing the subject. "What's so interesting about that album?"

"Everything. I'm looking at the you from before." He turned a page, his voice gentle.

"When I first met you, you were pale and fragile. It was heartbreaking. You remained weak for a long time, out of breath after just a few steps. It took ages for you to recover. I thought you were naturally delicate, but look how lively you were back then…"

He spoke softly, the girl in the album merging with the Isabella before him, forming a complete picture.

Isabella's heart melted. "Losing my memories felt like drifting at sea with no origin and no destination. But then I met you. Finally, I had a place in this world."

David's gaze was tender, filled with love.

They smiled at each other, and Isabella moved closer to look at the album with him.

"How old were you here? You look like a little boy."

"Five or six, I think. At the Atlante Gardens. There was a huge fish pond there."

"Huh?" David paused at a particular page. "…Isn't that Theodore?"

In the photo, Isabella stood in the middle, beaming. Eighteen-year-old Theodore had his arm around her shoulders, smiling at the camera.

They stood under a cherry blossom tree, petals drifting around them.

The image was painfully beautiful.

Isabella's eyes flickered. "Yes, it's him."

"You knew each other that early? Even before your sister?"

Isabella said, "The three of us grew up together."

David was surprised. "Childhood friends?"

"Well…"

"You could say that."

"And you and him…" It wasn't that David was overly suspicious, but their intimacy in the photo was undeniable.

Isabella was silent for a moment, then admitted frankly, "Yes."

She had never intended to hide it. It was all in the past. They both had their own families now. There was nothing she couldn't say.

Trying to conceal it would only make her seem guilty!

David: "??"

This gossip just landed on his own head?

"Then… can you give me some details?" David blinked, putting on a pitiful expression.

Isabella: "Like what?"

"Did you date? Were you engaged? Did our parents know?"

Isabella shook her head, telling the truth. "We never officially dated. But we had feelings for each other, and our families assumed we would marry."

David: "…"

"Why so quiet?" Isabella nudged his shoulder.

"…I don't want to talk." His voice was muffled.

"Why? Are you jealous?" Isabella laughed softly.

"Yes! I am!"

He even had the nerve to sound fierce about it.

Isabella couldn't help but smile. "Go ahead, be jealous. We'll have enough for sweet and sour ribs tonight."

David suddenly sighed. "Isabella…"

"Yes?" She looked up, puzzled.

Why that tone all of a sudden?

David: "Why didn't he wait for you? Why did he marry your sister? He had no patience. Not worth it. Not worth it at all…"

He was actually… feeling that Isabella deserved better?
###Chapter 428

New Year's Eve arrived in the blink of an eye.

The sound of firecrackers heralded the passing of the old year.

A warm spring breeze seemed to blow through the celebratory air.

"Good morning, Sophia. Why are you up so early?"

"Good morning, Grandfather!"

Sophia Sullivan had just come downstairs and saw Isaac Atlante sitting in the living room, steeping tea.

A beautifully polished pair of antique walnuts rested beside his hand.

"What would you like for breakfast?"

"I'll eat whatever is in the kitchen," Sophia said. "I'm not picky."

It was only eight-thirty after breakfast.

Sophia thought David and Isabella Sullivan were still asleep.

She was about to go upstairs to wake them.

Unexpectedly, Isabella had already taken her laptop to the study.

David had accompanied the grandmother out for shopping.

They had left with the driver for the morning market before dawn.

They returned at nine-thirty.

Their relationship had improved to the point—

"David knows so much! He even knows how to bargain!"

"No, no! I just shop for groceries often and have a bit more experience than others…"

One compliment from the grandmother.

And the middle-aged son-in-law blushed bright red.

The live-in staff had been given leave two days prior.

Only two chefs and one driver remained.

The grandmother had just finished taking stock of the ingredients upon returning home.

She immediately headed into the kitchen.

Her focus on tonight's New Year's Eve feast was evident.

David wasn't idle either.

Fresh from his mother-in-law's praise.

How could he not seize the chance to impress?

He promptly followed her into the kitchen.

At noon, the family gathered around the table for a simple meal.

Though called simple, there were still six or seven dishes.

The real main event was in the evening.

In the afternoon, Sophia woke from her nap.

She first played two games of chess with her grandfather.

Then she helped pack red envelopes.

Stacks of pink banknotes were arranged on the coffee table.

Beside them were red envelopes printed with blessings.

The large ones held ten thousand.

The medium ones held five thousand.

The small ones held one thousand.

Thirty of each needed to be prepared.

It was no small task.

Sophia's hands moved steadily.

She couldn't help but ask, "Do we have that many relatives to visit?"

Isaac sighed. "We didn't in the past. We're starting this year."

Sophia understood the reason after a moment's thought.

Previously, the elderly couple spent most of their time abroad.

New Year's was often spent hastily in a foreign land.

Visiting relatives and friends was out of the question.

Now that Isabella had been found.

The family was reunited.

Her grandfather and grandmother felt the desire to reconnect.

Isaac sighed. "We've been abroad all these years and gradually grew distant from relatives and friends. Some we occasionally called, others we lost touch with completely. We'll definitely be staying in the country from now on. Your grandmother feels it's necessary to reconnect with old relatives and friends…"

"Firstly, for the liveliness. Having people coming and going prevents the house from feeling cold and deserted. Secondly, to expand your social circle. These connections could develop into a network for you younger generation in the future."

"Ultimately, people are social creatures. Seeking warmth in a group is instinctive. If anything were to happen to us in the future, you would have people to turn to for help."

This was the concept of family.

Before, the elderly couple was busy searching for their daughter.

They had no mind for managing social connections.

Now their daughter was found.

She brought back a son-in-law and a granddaughter.

The grandmother became active again.

Making plans and paving the way for her daughter's family.

Sophia understood the elders' good intentions.

She didn't offer any advice.

She didn't say anything.

Her hands moved even more deftly as she packed the red envelopes.

Sebastian Evans arrived home at four in the afternoon.

Perhaps to match the occasion.

He wore a red sweater today.

It was revealed when he took off his coat upon entering.

The vibrant, eye-catching red made his skin appear even paler.

The grandmother smiled warmly. "That's a wonderful outfit! So festive! Sophia is wearing a red sweater today too. What a coincidence between you siblings!"

Sebastian looked toward Sophia.

She was not only wearing a red sweater.

But also a white scarf.

The combination of red and white.

Easily drew attention.

The grandmother, seeing this, looked somewhat pleased. "Well? Doesn't Sophia look beautiful dressed like this?"

Sebastian nodded, calmly withdrawing his gaze. "Yes, beautiful."

His tone was even.

He simply agreed with the grandmother's words.

It wouldn't give anyone cause for suspicion.

He walked over to the coffee table.

"Packing red envelopes?"

The grandfather wasn't polite either.

He waved a hand. "Don't just stand there. Come help."

"Alright." Sebastian rolled up his sleeves.

He crouched down beside Sophia.

With his help, efficiency greatly increased.

Soon, all the money was packed.

Leaving behind a pile of money bands.

Replaced by bulging red envelopes.

By six in the evening, it was completely dark.

At some point, a light snow had begun to fall outside.

Fluttering softly down to the earth.

Inside, the fireplace was lit and the heating was on.

Decorations were bright red and full of festive joy.

It felt like a completely different world from outside.

Outside, the cold wind whistled.

Inside, there was laughter and happy chatter.

"The last dish! Dinner is almost ready!" The grandmother emerged from the kitchen, happily announcing the progress.

Everyone began to move upon hearing this.

Setting out bowls and chopsticks, pulling out chairs, fetching wine glasses… each attending to their own task.

Just as the final dish was placed on the table and everyone gathered to begin eating—

The doorbell rang.

Sophia was the first to rise. "I'll get it."

The grandmother couldn't help but frown and mutter softly, "Everyone's home having their reunion dinner on New Year's Eve…"

Who could be so inconsiderate as to visit someone else's home at this hour?

The door opened, followed by a woman's cheerful laughter—

"Happy New Year, Sophia!"

That voice…

Sebastian's smile froze.

Before the grandfather and grandmother could react.

The visitors had already crossed the living room—

"Mom, Dad,Theodore Valdemar and I are here to celebrate the New Year with you."

Irene Valdemar wore a red coat today.

Her hair was clearly styled specially.

All pinned up, making her look particularly spirited.

Walking beside her was her husband, Theodore Valdemar.

The man wore a suit, his figure tall and straight.

He carried numerous large and small bags in his hands.

He spoke immediately after. "Dad, Mom, Happy New Year."

As he spoke, his gaze fell on Isabella's face.

Then it swept over David Sullivan beside her.

"Isabella, brother-in-law," this form of address seemed somewhat difficult for him, but he managed to say it, "Happy New Year."

David immediately stood up, responding with a smile. "Happy New Year, Happy New Year!"

He still wore an apron.

The cuffs of his sleeves were still rolled up, not yet straightened.

Compared to Theodore in his suit and leather shoes.

He seemed far too ordinary…

Too ordinary to appear in the Atlante home.

And to sit at such a feast.

Yet the reality was—

Florence Atlante: "David, please sit down! Why stand up? There's no need for such formality. Don't be a stranger."

"Mom, I was just greeting brother-in-law. We only briefly met last time in the city, didn't have time to talk."

Isabella raised an eyebrow slightly upon hearing this.

She looked up at David.

He caught her gaze.

Immediately returned a "don't worry" look.

Signaling he wouldn't cause trouble.

Isabella: "…" Who was worried he would cause trouble?

Really…
###Chapter 429

Irene Valdemar held Theodore Valdemar's arm, smiling warmly at Isabella Sullivan.
"Minnie, and you too, brother-in-law. You're both here? Mom and Dad didn't mention anything. We thought you weren't coming to Kyoto for the New Year this time. This is wonderful, the whole family is together."

Her smile was sweet, her words impeccably polite.

Isaac Atlante and Florence Atlante exchanged a glance.

Ever since Irene married into the Valdemar family, she hadn't returned for holidays like Mid-Autumn or Spring Festival.

The old lady herself preferred not to see her; her absence was more peaceful.

Besides, the Valdemar household was large. As a daughter-in-law, Irene had in-laws to attend to and children to care for. Coming back to her maiden home for the New Year wasn't really proper.

It could be said that when you dislike someone, even their breathing feels wrong.

If it were Isabella returning for the New Year, the old lady would be grinning from ear to ear.

Now, with Irene's sudden appearance, the old lady's smile faded slightly.

But it was the New Year. They couldn't very well turn her away, especially with Sebastian Evans present. Though reluctant, the elderly couple invited them to sit and eat.

The housekeeper added two place settings.

Irene sat down with a smile.
"Being able to enjoy this meal today is all thanks to Minnie."

No one responded.

Unfazed, she picked up a piece of braised pork rib and placed it in Theodore's bowl.
"This looks good. Try it."

Theodore's tone was cool.
"I'll help myself."

Irene took a bite of the rib and paused.

"Is this... Mom's own cooking?"

David Sullivan nodded.
"Mom has been busy since morning. Most of the dishes on the table were made by her."

Irene's heart instantly soured.

She had long known they played favorites, known they treated them differently, but seeing it with her own eyes was still hard to bear.

"My sister certainly has the greater influence. Mom hasn't cooked in years. I thought I'd never get to taste her cooking again in this lifetime."

Theodore frowned.
###Chapter 430
"Just eat. Say less."

Irene laughed.
"What? In front of Mom and Dad, you want to use food to shut me up?"

Theodore replied,
"You're not usually this talkative at home."

"I've returned to my maiden home today. Can't I speak my mind freely?"

Theodore set down his chopsticks.
"No one is stopping you from speaking. But can you finish eating first?"

Irene's smile froze. She was about to retort.

"Mom—" Sebastian suddenly spoke.
"Grandmother put a lot of effort into preparing this meal. Try this, it should suit your taste."

He placed a piece of braised pork belly in Irene's bowl.

Irene finally relented. Picking up her bowl, she smiled.
"Yes, it tastes wonderful. Mom's skills haven't changed a bit."

The atmosphere eased, and everyone continued their meal.

At least on the surface, it was harmonious.

...

After the meal, the old man took Theodore and Sebastian to the study to discuss matters. Only Florence, Isabella, and Irene remained in the living room.

Sophia Sullivan had gone upstairs.

David Sullivan, too full, had gone for a walk in the yard. He also wanted to check on the flowers his mother kept in the glass conservatory.

Many were imported seedlings, rare domestically. He had long wanted to study them closely.

Isabella sat on the sofa with Florence, watching the New Year's Gala. Mother and daughter chatted and laughed, warm and harmonious.

Occasionally, when an interesting skit came on, they would lean together to discuss and comment.

In contrast, Irene sat alone at the other end of the sofa. Silent. Her gaze was distant, lost in thought.

Until—

Isabella stood up.
"I'll go cut some fruit."

The old lady held her back.
"Let the housekeeper do it. Don't trouble yourself."

Isabella smiled softly.
"It's just cutting fruit. It'll be quick."

She also considered that the two chefs had already returned to their quarters to rest. It was the New Year; they deserved a break.

With that, she turned and walked towards the kitchen.

The old lady's eyes followed her daughter's shadow, a smile on her lips, reluctant to look away.

After this period of treatment, and with the old lady's active cooperation, her eyesight had recovered quickly.

Reading small print and physical books was still somewhat difficult, but watching TV and seeing people in daily life was no longer a problem.

She was now immensely grateful she had listened to advice and not given up on treatment. Otherwise...

Now, she felt she could never get enough of looking.

"Mom, it's been getting cold lately. Don't you like the southern climate? I know a place in State A that's perfect for escaping the cold. After the New Year, let me take you and Dad there for a while?"

Seeing Isabella leave, Irene's eyes shifted. Smiling, she moved to sit beside the old lady.

However, the moment Florence felt her approach, her smile faded.
###Chapter 431
"No need. Staying home is fine. Your father and I can make our own arrangements if needed. You needn't worry."

Irene pressed,
"I know you and Dad can arrange things, but... I also want to fulfill my filial duty."

"We have no plans to travel far recently." Seeing that Irene was pretending not to understand, the old lady decided to be blunt.

She simply didn't want to go.

"Why?" Irene clenched her fingers.
"Because Minnie is back?"

During the meal, she had kept a smile on her face. But seeing how the old man and old lady doted on Isabella, how even David Sullivan received better treatment than her...

Irene had been simmering with anger, only holding back for the sake of the occasion.

Now, she could contain it no longer.

She let out a cold laugh.
"Mom, truthfully, I've never understood."

"Why do you hate me so much? Just because I went out with Minnie and only I managed to escape and return? Did you want me to disappear without a trace like her? Would that have made you happy?"

"Now that Minnie is back, I thought you could let go of your prejudice and accept me again. But you're still like this... What exactly have I done wrong to deserve this treatment?"

Irene's voice caught with a sob.

It had always been like this. They always favored their biological daughter. They never treated them equally.

Why was Isabella the treasured one in their palm, while she was just weeds by the roadside?

The old lady looked her straight in the eye, enunciating each word clearly.
"You actually don't know what you did wrong? Hah..."

Just then, Isabella emerged with a fruit platter.

She invited Irene and the old lady to have some fruit. Before she could finish speaking, Irene spoke up.
"Minnie, come with me for a moment. Among the gifts I brought this time, there are many dried seafood and preserves. I'll show you how to store them."

The old lady said mildly,
"Leave that to the housekeeper. Minnie, you don't need to bother with it."

Being refused again, Irene's face darkened.

But Isabella smiled and said,
"In this weather, dried goods can easily get damp and moldy. I'd better go take a look."

The old lady frowned but didn't stop her further.

Suppressing her anger, Irene led Isabella into the garden.

It suddenly became quiet all around.

This was the first time the two sisters had been alone face-to-face after so many years.

Isabella knew Irene had something to say.

Similarly, she also had questions she wanted to ask.

"Sister, if you have something to say, just say it directly."
Isabella remained calm.

Irene’s anger flared at her composure.

Her gaze was icy, a mix of fury and jealousy.

Irene suddenly let out a cold laugh.

The moonlight cast a pale glow on her face.

Her red coat made her look like a vengeful spirit.

Confusion flickered in Isabella’s eyes.

“Little sister, I’ve always envied you.”

“I envied your parents’ love, Theodore’s care.”

“You were always the center of attention.”

“Standing next to you, I was the ugly duckling to your swan.”

“But my last name is Valdemar too!”

Isabella stepped forward to steady her. “Sis, you’re drunk.”

Irene shook her off. “Don’t touch me! Stop pretending! You’re laughing at me inside, aren’t you?”

“I’m not…”

“Our parents only ever had eyes for you. Why?” Irene spun around, gripping Isabella’s shoulders.

Her gaze darkened. “For over twenty years, everything was fine.”

“Why did you have to come back? Why couldn’t you just leave things as they were?”

“You have a husband, a daughter, a perfect family.”

“You’re a famous writer. You have everything!”

“Why come back to compete for more?!”

Irene was hysterical, venting years of pent-up resentment.

Isabella took a half-step back, her eyes cooling.

“Sis, we grew up together. We know each other well.”

“You showing up tonight wasn’t just to celebrate the New Year with our parents, was it?”

Irene paused.

Isabella continued, “You getting drunk and saying all this isn’t a spur-of-the-moment thing either.”

“Since we know each other so well, why not be direct? What do you want?”

“That way, you don’t have to pretend, and I don’t have to guess. It’s easier for everyone.”

“Heh…” Irene straightened up and suddenly smiled. “After more than twenty years, you haven’t changed.”

Still so sharp. Still so infuriating!

“Fine. Since we’re being blunt, I’ll get straight to the point.” Irene’s drunkenness vanished.

Her eyes were clear as she stared at Isabella.

“I brought Theodore here to see how you two act around each other now.”

Isabella asked, “And what did you find out?”

Irene studied her. “You, I can’t figure out.”

“But Theodore clearly still has feelings for you. Don’t deny it. I’m not blind.”

“I wasn’t going to deny it,” Isabella said.

Irene fell silent.

“You still haven’t stated your purpose. Or let me rephrase.”

“Why did you call me out here to put on this show? What exactly do you want me to do?”

“Isabella, you’re still so clever. My demand is simple.”

“Stay away from Theodore. As far as possible.”

“Even if he approaches you, you avoid him!”

Isabella asked, “Is that all?”

“Don’t change the subject! Do you dare promise me that?”

Isabella looked puzzled. “Sis, I truly don’t understand your logic.”

“If he’s the one with lingering feelings, why not talk to him directly?”

“Communicate your concerns and your demands to him. Wouldn’t that solve the problem better?”

“See? That face,” Irene clicked her tongue in disgust. “So dismissive. Acting like everything is simple. Like you’re so clever!”

“If I could make demands of Theodore, would I need to come to you?!” she snarled.

Isabella said seriously, “You’re husband and wife. Shouldn’t couples communicate and discuss things?”

“Heh… But he doesn’t see me as his wife!” Irene gritted her teeth.

Isabella was silent for a moment before looking up. “I’m sorry. I can’t do that.”

“What do you mean?!” Irene’s eyes narrowed. “Do you still want to rekindle something with him?!”

“First, your demand is unreasonable.”

“Second, we grew up together. By your logic, we can’t even speak in the future? Become strangers? Is that possible?”

“Finally, I have no obligation to promise you anything. And you have no right to demand it of me.”

Irene retorted, “So you’re saying you still can’t let him go!”

Isabella didn’t want to continue. Some people just wouldn’t listen.

You could explain a thousand times, and they’d still twist your words.

She turned to leave.

Irene spoke to her retreating back, her tone ominous. “Aren’t you afraid I’ll tell your husband about you and Theodore?”

“Do you think he’ll still treat you well after he finds out?”

Isabella laughed. She turned around to let Irene see her smile. “Go ahead. I don’t mind.”

“You’re… not afraid?”

“Why should I be? He already knows.”

“What? David knows about you and Theodore?!”

Isabella said, “Is that strange? Of course he asked after I regained my memories.”

“You told him?!” Irene’s eyes widened.

Isabella nodded. “Yes.”

“And he wasn’t angry?”

“It’s ancient history. Why would he be angry?” Isabella genuinely didn’t understand.

But this conversation made one thing clear.

Irene’s marriage to Theodore seemed unhappy.

“Haha… Fake! So fake! Isabella, you’re so fake!”

Isabella ignored her and continued inside.

Suddenly—

“Isabella! You’re just a shameless, rotten—”

“Shut up!”

“What, struck a nerve? I’ll say it! You’re trash! Back then, during the kidnapping, who knows how many men had you!”

Isabella’s eyes turned completely cold.

“Kidnapping? You actually know it was a kidnapping. But why?”

Irene froze.

Isabella moved closer. “Back then, we were hiding. We could have escaped safely.”

“Why did you deliberately make noise and lead the kidnappers to us?”
###Chapter 432

Irene's body went rigid, as if she'd seen a ghost.

Her lips trembled. "You... you..."

She remembered?

She remembered the kidnapping?!

Then...

Irene didn't dare think further.

Isabella saw the fear in her eyes and offered a bleak smile. "So you made that noise on purpose. You deliberately drew the kidnappers' attention. You intentionally got me caught."

That year, the two girls had gone out shopping and were kidnapped.

They were bound and taken to an abandoned factory on the outskirts of the city.

The kidnappers acted on impulse, motivated by lust.

Several of them moved toward Irene. Isabella stepped in front of her.

She revealed her family background, producing a black card, cash, and her ID.

All to convince them her family was wealthy.

As for Irene...

"Her clothes are all my hand-me-downs. She's just here today to carry my bags. Bothering her is useless. If you have the guts, demand a ransom from my family! Three to five million? Twenty to thirty million? Name your price!"

Isabella spoke with her chin slightly raised, a look of disdain in her eyes.

She perfectly embodied the spoiled heiress.

The kidnappers bought it.

Isabella breathed a sigh of relief, but missed the flash of humiliation and venom in Irene's eyes.

A servant?

So that's all she was in her eyes? A servant?

Ha...

While the kidnappers discussed the ransom, Isabella used a hidden shard of glass to cut her ropes.

Late at night, when the kidnappers were asleep, she quietly freed herself.

She woke Irene and untied her.

The two sisters fled the warehouse under cover of darkness.

But the kidnappers discovered their escape soon after.

The men gave chase.

Isabella pulled Irene along as they ran, asking for her phone to call the police.

Her own phone had been confiscated.

But she remembered Irene had a backup phone.

Irene claimed she hadn't brought it.

Isabella didn't give up, leading her into the hills.

She knew it was hard to get help in the suburbs at night.

Even if people were around, they wouldn't dare intervene.

Hiding in the deep mountains was their best bet.

The kidnappers were few and couldn't search the entire area.

If they hid well for a day or two, the men would likely give up.

Then it would be safe to come out.

Everything was going according to plan.

Near dawn, she found a small animal den for Irene.

It was only big enough for one person to lie on their side.

Irene asked anxiously, "What about you, Isabella?"

Isabella pointed to a narrow gap between two large rocks nearby.

She was thin enough to squeeze in.

From that distance, the sisters could still keep an eye on each other.

The kidnappers searched the area but found nothing. Cursing, they prepared to leave.

Just as Isabella began to relax, a faint noise caught the kidnappers' attention.

They turned back and found Isabella.

Terrified, she tried to run.

But they caught her and slapped her hard across the face.

Her ears rang. Her mind went blank.

The world spun as she was thrown over a shoulder and carried away.

Before they left, she locked eyes with the den's opening.

Their gazes met. She saw the panic, fear, and tears in Irene's eyes.

In that moment, she didn't overthink it. She trusted her instinctively.

She mouthed words silently, unsure if Irene could see them.

She said: Get out. Call the police.

The kidnappers were also talking.

"We only got one. What if the other one calls the cops? We're finished."

"She must be hiding nearby! Should we keep looking?"

"No! If the police are called, we need to move now. No time to waste."

"Lucky we got the rich girl. That servant is worthless."

"True..."

But the leader wasn't so easily fooled.

He put Isabella down, grabbed her hair, and demanded to know where Irene was.

Isabella screamed curses. "That bitch! She ran off and stole my diamond necklace and bracelet! I'll have my father fire her when I get back! That bitch! I'll kill her!"

The kidnappers roared with laughter.

Go back?

Did she really think she was going back?

If the servant had run off with stolen goods, she definitely wouldn't dare call the police.

They were completely reassured.

They didn't return to the warehouse. They got a truck and eventually boarded a ship.

Afraid Isabella might try to escape again, they drugged her.

The drugs left her limbs weak, her body limp. She could barely stand.

She spent most days in a drowsy state, losing track of time.

But she never gave up hope.

"I thought my sister must have called the police. They would start investigating from the warehouse, track the kidnappers' route. My rescue was just a matter of time."

Isabella stood under the falling snow.

The light illuminated her pale, nearly translucent face.

But her eyes were startlingly bright.

She moved closer again, staring directly at Irene, like a detective interrogating a suspect. "Sister, after you escaped, did you call the police?!"

Irene backed away step by step until her back hit the cold wall.

She trembled all over, her eyes wide with terror. She couldn't speak.

"I guess not." Isabella sighed softly.

"I even suspect you made that noise on purpose, so the kidnappers would find me!"

"Of course you knew the risk. They might find me, or you, or even catch us both! But that didn't stop you from taking that gamble, did it?"

"Sister, what deep hatred exists between us? What made you hate me so much you wished for my death?!"

Irene met her accusing gaze.

At first, she was flustered, panicked, terrified.

But slowly, she calmed down.

"So you never lost your memory!"
Yinian stared at her intently.

"Liar! You've been lying this whole time!"

Isabella met her gaze calmly. "I did lose my memory. I've only recently started to remember."

Some details were still hazy.

She could only probe Yinian.

She never expected…

The result of her probing was shocking.

"You… what do you want?"

"So, you admit to everything I just said?"

Yinian averted her eyes. "I don't know what you're talking about…"

Her earlier aggression had vanished, replaced by evasion.

Isabella wasn't angry.

She smiled faintly.

"You just said I was doted on since childhood, while you were like an ugly duckling. That Mom and Dad loved me, and that Theodore also liked me. Do you know why?"

When she mentioned "Theodore also liked me," a flash of resentment crossed Yinian's eyes.

"First, regarding our parents. I was their biological child. You were adopted. They never mistreated you. They gave you a privileged life. Everything I had, you had too. You received far more than the average person."

"Of course, people are always greedy. The more they get, the more they want."

Yinian snapped, "What do you know?! They didn't mistreat me, but they loved you more!"

The problem isn't scarcity, but inequality.

"Why shouldn't they love me more?" Isabella countered. "I'm their biological daughter!"

Yinian was speechless.

While both the palm and the back of the hand are flesh, people instinctively protect the palm more.

It's human nature.

Isabella enunciated each word clearly. "That is not a reason for you to resent them and hurt me!"

Yinian sneered.

Isabella continued, "Let me give you an example. Between Sebastian and an adopted child, who would you favor more? Could you treat them completely equally?"

Yinian froze.

"Since even you can't do it, what right do you have to demand our parents do?"

People often fail to recognize their own place.

"You're right, I'm not the biological one…" Yinian began to laugh. "I'm not biological… So many times I've wondered, why was I the one who was adopted, and you were the biological one? Why was your fate so blessed, and mine so cheap?"

Isabella hit the nail on the head. "You're not complaining about an unfair fate. You're jealous that someone has more than you. And that person happens to be so close to you, close enough for you to see the disparity everywhere. That's why it sticks in your craw."

"You're not overthinking it, nor are you just temporarily confused. You are purely malicious!"

This sentence completely shattered Yinian.

Her eyes widened in fury. "What do you know?! You got everything, so it's easy for you to talk! I'm bad? It was you who made me this way!"

"So, you harmed me?"

"Yes," she admitted. "I couldn't stand you, so spoiled and willful, yet doted on by everyone. I disliked even more how Theodore orbited around you. People shouldn't have smooth sailing all their lives. They need to suffer a little."

"Wouldn't it be interesting to let the little princess of the Sullivan family taste the bitterness of being trampled underfoot, ground into the mud, and experience a life of displacement?"

Isabella's eyes turned icy. "So, that time when we were running away, and you said you didn't have a backup phone… that was also a lie?"

"Yes, I had it. I just didn't want to take it out."

"You—"

Even after all these years, Isabella was still infuriated by her.

"You look furious. But what right do you have to be angry? You escaped in the end, didn't you? You got married, had a daughter, lived a good life for over twenty years."

"Actually, I did think you might still be alive. Maybe crippled, sold into some remote mountain, or became a beggar… I just never imagined you could live so comfortably."

"Isabella, why is your luck always so good?"

Isabella said, "It seems you really do envy me."

Yinian sneered. "Yes, I envy you. But I hate you even more!"

Suddenly, footsteps approached.

Sophia's voice rang out—

"Mom?"

Isabella gave her a deep look, then turned and walked inside. "I'm here, sweetie—"

"Grandma was asking where you were. She's been looking for you everywhere."

"Just finished checking the inventory. Coming now!"

Yinian stood rooted to the spot, not moving for a long time.

Snowflakes landed on her shoulders, melting into her hair. The chill seeped from her scalp into her heart.

…

When Theodore and Sebastian Evans came out of the study, the old lady wasn't there. Only Isabella remained in the living room.

Yinian had left at some point, unnoticed.

Theodore didn't ask a single question about her.

"Dad, I'm going out for a smoke."

With that, he strode out the door.

Theodore looked at Isabella, walked over, and stopped in front of her. His heartbeat quickened.

"Happy New Year, Isabella."

"Happy New Year." Isabella smiled.

Their eyes met. One was deep and abyssal, the other calm and unruffled.

"Finished talking with Dad?"

"Yes." Theodore nodded. "We're getting ready to leave."

"Alright." Isabella called toward the kitchen, "David, leave that for now. Come out. Let's see brother-in-law off together."

The word "brother-in-law" pierced his heart like ten thousand arrows.

Theodore lowered his gaze, concealing the pain in his eyes.

"Coming!" David Sullivan hurried out from the kitchen, his hands still wet.

Isabella handed him a tissue. "Dry your hands."

"Okay." David took it. "The soy milk is blending. It'll be ready in a moment."

Earlier, Isabella had gone to the garden and came back saying she was cold and wanted something warm to drink.

The old lady had gone upstairs to get a heating pad, and David had gone into the kitchen to make soy milk.

That's why only Isabella was in the living room when Theodore came out.

Isabella said, "Let's go. We'll see brother-in-law off."

"Sure." David nodded with a cheerful smile.

Theodore: "…"

At the doorway, seeing Sebastian smoking outside, he suddenly felt like having a cigarette too.

"Sebastian."

Sebastian turned around. "Dad, leaving already?"

"Yes."

He stubbed out his cigarette, ready to go together.

Isabella called her daughter over. "Sophia, come here too. See your brother and uncle off."

Sebastian's gaze faltered. He wanted to reach for another cigarette.

Father and son's eyes met, seeing the same loneliness reflected in each other.

…

Under the watchful eyes of Isabella and her family of three, Theodore and Sebastian each drove away.

Sebastian was returning to his apartment, in the opposite direction from Theodore.

The father and son parted ways at the intersection.

Suddenly, Theodore's phone rang. He pulled over and answered—

"What is it?"

Yinian's stiff voice came through. "I saw your car. I'm in the coffee shop next to you."

He hung up. Shortly after, Yinian got into the car.

The door opened, letting in a blast of cold wind.

Theodore started the engine and drove straight towards their villa.

Arriving home, they had just stepped inside when Yinian turned on the light, spun around, and—

Smack!

A sharp crack echoed.

Her head was snapped to the side from the force.

"Theodore, have you lost your mind?!" she shrieked, her expression one of utter disbelief.

"I heard everything."

Yinian froze.

What had he heard?
###Chapter 433

He really heard.

Rage burned in Theodore Valdemar's eyes.
He bit out each word with deliberate force.
"How dare you do this?"

Irene Valdemar's gaze darted away.
She quickly adopted an innocent expression.
"Honey, what are you talking about?"

The man let out a cold laugh.
"If you weren't guilty, would you still call me 'honey' after being slapped?"
"You should have started cursing me out by now."

A chill ran down Irene's spine.
Her fingertips trembled slightly.
"I thought you were drunk..."

"I haven't touched a drop tonight."
Theodore's voice was icy.

She swallowed with difficulty.
Her tone took on a wounded note.
"What exactly happened?"
"Was it worth treating me like this?"

Tears slid down.
They traced paths on her well-maintained face.
Her eyes and brows still held a fading charm.
"I was pampered and spoiled growing up too."
"You hit me just like that."
"Where does that leave my dignity?"

Her voice grew softer.
Her head bowed lower.
She resembled a bullied young wife.
Her complaints held a coquettish note.
Even a hint of seduction.

Theodore remained unmoved.
He watched her coldly.
From head to toe.
From toe to head.

A mocking smile suddenly touched his lips.
"I never knew you were such a good actress before."
"Or that you had such nerve."

"What 'pampered and spoiled'?"
"But in the Atlante Gardens..."
"You weren't saying that."

He heard!
Irene's soul trembled.

Her eyes shifted from confused to terrified.
Finally, only panic remained.
"Honey, let me explain."
"I didn't mean to argue with Emilia."
"Did you see us from the balcony?"

"Irene!"
Theodore's voice was sharp.
"Still not telling the truth?"
"I didn't see."
"I heard it with my own ears!"

"I heard you arguing."
"I heard the truth about that year."
"You planned for her to fall back into the kidnappers' hands."
"You hid it and delayed."
"You made the police miss the rescue window!"

"You made her disappear for over twenty years!"
"Unable to reunite with her family!"
"You're the one to blame!"

"No wonder Mom and Dad distanced themselves from you all these years."
"They suspected you long ago."
"They just had no proof."
"And they were focused entirely on finding Emilia."
"That's why they let you be until now."

Irene continued playing dumb.
"What are you saying?"
"What truth? What delay?"
"Emilia and I argued since we were kids."
"It was just bickering in the garden."
"How can you take angry words seriously?"

Theodore's gaze was sharp as a blade.
"Still trying to fool me?"
"Are you too naive?"
"Or do you take me for a fool?"

"If you admitted it frankly."
"I might still respect you a little."
"Emilia was right."
"You're just pure evil."

Irene swayed on her feet.
He heard!
He really heard!

"Yes! I did it on purpose!"
"I meant for her to be captured!"
"I wanted her dead!"
"Are you satisfied now?!"

Slap—
Another strike landed.

Theodore trembled with anger.
"Why?!"
"She was your sister!"

"Sister?"
Irene laughed wildly.
"She was an Atlante too!"
"And the biological one!"
"Always one step ahead of me!"
"You liked her too!"
"Why?!"

"Just for that?"
"You wanted her dead?!"

"Exactly! I envied her! I was jealous!"

"Irene, you're insane!"

"Hahaha... Yes, I'm insane!"
"I went crazy over twenty years ago!"
"Seeing you being affectionate with her."
"I wanted to strangle her!"

"Even now!"
"Watching your eyes glued to her."
"As if you could watch her until the end of time."
"Do you know how much I hated it?!"

"Theodore, you are my husband."
"We are family!"
"It's been over twenty years."
"Why can't you forget her?"
"Even though she's married with children."
"You still gaze at her longingly."

"Seeing David Sullivan must make you jealous, right?"
"Wish he would disappear?"
"You look at David Sullivan."
"The way I look at Emilia."
"We're both pitiful creatures."
"Driven mad by unrequited love!"

Theodore's voice was low.
"You're wrong."
"No matter how jealous, I would never harm him."
"Because I know—"
"Without him, Emilia still wouldn't be mine."

Irene laughed maniacally.
"Then we really are different."
"I got rid of Emilia."
"And you became mine!"
"Hahaha..."

"So I wasn't wrong."
"Emilia disappeared."
"You married me."
"We had children and lived over twenty years."
"It was worth it!"

Theodore's entire body went rigid.

Irene continued twisting the knife.
"If I'm the killer."
"Then you're the bounty!"
"The trophy!"
"Eliminate the opponent and claim it!"
"Of course I had to risk everything."
"Was I wrong?"

"When you get down to it."
"You're the one who harmed Emilia."
"Hahaha..."

"Originally, I was used to Mom and Dad favoring her."
"But it was your love for Emilia."
"That triggered my jealousy."
"That made me gamble everything."

The man's fists clenched.
His face twitched.
Pain and regret warred in his eyes.

He suddenly looked up.
Emphasizing each word.
"That time I slept with you."
"Was that your scheme too?"

Irene met his bloodshot eyes.
She trembled all over.
"Y-You couldn't resist temptation..."

"I never touched you that night."
Theodore stepped closer.
His dark eyes were deep.
"How did you get pregnant?"

...

The Atlante family kept watch on New Year's Eve.
Florence Atlante wanted to stay up all night.

Everyone disagreed.
They finally compromised.
"Not the whole night."
"But we'll welcome the New Year after midnight before sleeping."

Isabella Sullivan nodded.
"That works."

The old lady surprisingly had no objections.
She was happy as a child.
She loved being managed by Isabella.

Isaac Atlante silently gave a thumbs up.

As midnight approached.
The Spring Festival Gala countdown began.

Isabella and David Sullivan accompanied the elderly couple.
Smiles on their faces.

Sophia Sullivan curled up in a beanbag chair.
Playing on her phone leisurely.

Suddenly, a ringtone sounded.

Caller ID—

Alexander Laurent.
###Chapter 434

"Sophia, Happy New Year."

His voice was deep and rich, like a cello flowing through the night.

Everything was quiet, only his voice softly vibrating in her ear.

Sophia's ears felt slightly warm. She gently rubbed them and switched the phone to her other side.

"Professor, Happy New Year."

The countdown voices of the Spring Festival Gala hosts came through the phone—

"Five, four, three, two—"

The moment "one" fell, Alexander spoke softly. "Sophia, look up."

She instinctively looked out the window.

Fireworks bloomed across the sky, their falling light like stardust scattering towards the earth.

"Kyoto is setting off fireworks this year?"

"They're electronic fireworks! Didn't they say the technical challenges hadn't been overcome yet?"

"They must have solved them! Otherwise, how could they be displayed?"

"They're so beautiful! And no gunpowder smell!"

"Electronic fireworks last longer and fall closer. It feels like you could almost reach out and catch them…"

"Will we see them every New Year's Eve from now on?"

"Of course! Once the technology is developed, it's meant to be used!"

Neighbors came out to watch the fireworks. Exclamations of awe mixed with the sound of the displays, creating a lively atmosphere.

Sophia was completely captivated.

Fireworks bloomed and faded in her clear pupils, a moment of extreme, breathtaking beauty.

There were no regrets after such a magnificent display. Blooming and fading each had their time.

On the other end of the phone, Alexander said softly, "Sophia, our third year has arrived."

Sophia smiled, gazing at the night sky fireworks and murmuring, "Time flies… It's already been two New Year's Eves…"

"Are you free for a video call?" he asked.

"Okay."

The video request came quickly. Sophia accepted.

Alexander was wearing a turtleneck sweater. His profile was soft under the light, the usual coolness gone, replaced by a touch of gentleness.

Fireworks continuously bloomed behind them, illuminating half the night sky.

Alexander suddenly laughed.

Sophia asked, "Professor, what are you laughing at?"

"Can't I laugh if I'm happy?"

She nodded. "You should laugh."

"I thought you would ask me why I'm happy."

"Of course you're happy because it's the New Year."

Was that even a question?

But Alexander shook his head. "No."

"Hmm?"

"Not happy because of the New Year."

"Then why?"

"For you."

Sophia was stunned.

Alexander spoke again. "Sophia, I…"

"Sophia! Come in quickly! It's cold outside. Watching through the glass is just the same!" Florence's voice called out.

"Okay, Grandma— coming right away!"

After responding, she looked at Alexander. "Professor, what were you going to say just now?"

Alexander was silent for a moment. "...It's nothing. Go inside."

"Okay."

"Goodnight."

"Goodbye."

...

"Third Brother, who are you on the phone with? And you came outside?"

Xun came out for a smoke and saw his younger brother standing in the garden. He was only wearing a thin sweater but didn't seem cold at all, smiling at his phone.

He had wanted to get closer to hear the conversation.

But before he could approach, the call ended.

Alexander frowned. "Why did you come out?"

Xun shook his cigarette case.

"Smoke less. It's bad for your health."

Xun looked at his serious expression and couldn't help laughing. "Not smoking hurts more."

"Where does it hurt?"

"The heart yearns. It's agonizing."

Alexander: "...Wait until Mom deals with you."

"That's why I came out. Who were you talking to just now? You looked so happy."

Alexander: "None of your business."

"Third Brother, that's no way to talk. Do me a favor?"

"No." Alexander shook his head.

"Keeping it all secret? A girlfriend?"

"Don't talk nonsense."

"It really is a girlfriend!"

"You're making things up!"

"Mom— Third Brother has a girl—"

Alexander spoke at the same time: "Mom— Brother is smoking aga—"

They both fell silent.

"Yo, what are you two doing here staring each other down?"

Yan came over, grinning at his older and younger brothers.

"What were you shouting just now? You stopped halfway?"

Alexander & Xun: "What's it to you?"

Yan: "...?"

"Don't walk away! Explain! Why do you run as soon as I show up? What secret can't I hear?!"

The three brothers entered the house one after the other.

They ran straight into Sylvia.

All three stopped simultaneously.

Sylvia glanced over her three sons. "What were you doing outside?"

In unison: "Getting some air."

Sylvia: "?" Was the house that stuffy?

"Xun, come with me to Uncle Qi's house the day after tomorrow."

"For what?"

"New Year's visit."

Yan saw right through it. "And incidentally meet Miss Qi Ru for a blind date. See if you hit it off."

Xun frowned. "I'm on a business trip the day after tomorrow. No time. Mom, take Second Brother. He's interested."

"Don't," Yan waved his hand. "I have to go to the Temple of Divinity to get the first incense. Our family's luck this year depends on me. No time for blind dates. Maybe the Qi family just wants to get the first incense and is using their daughter as a smokescreen."

"You rascal, what nonsense are you talking?!" Sylvia raised her hand to hit him.

"I think Alexander is suitable. Polite and well-mannered. Miss Qi would definitely like him."

Xun nodded. "There's potential."

Sylvia looked at her youngest son expectantly.

Alexander said nothing, turning and going upstairs.

The silence was deafening.

The refusal was utterly blatant.

"Look at him! He infuriates me! You two are just the same—" Sylvia stamped her foot.

Xun and Yan quickly made their escape.

This happened every year. They were long used to it.

...

Under the brilliant city lights, some were reunited, while others were alone.

The Roscente family estate—

The banquet had long ended. Guests had gradually left.

Victoria sat on the sofa, watching the fireworks outside the window. Her eyes held no surprise, only melancholy.

Ethan had gone into his study to work after the reunion dinner and hadn't emerged since.

Her daughter had been despondent since being expelled from MIT, shutting herself in her bedroom all day, unwilling to go out.

She was even more afraid relatives would ask about her withdrawal from school.

Victoria had called her twice tonight.

The first time, there was a response: "Not hungry. You eat."

The second time, there wasn't even a reply.

Victoria looked at the closed door and left disappointed.

As for her son, Ethan Roscente…

On New Year's Eve, he hadn't even come home.
###Chapter 435

He was not doing well at all.

Relatives kept asking about Ethan Roscente's whereabouts.

Victoria Roscente could only force a smile and explain he was away on business.

A business trip on New Year's Eve.

Everyone saw through the lie.

But no one wanted to point it out.

Victoria couldn't help but think of the past.

Ethan was successful in his career.

She was respected wherever she went.

Her daughter was beautiful and sensible.

Staying by her side to entertain guests.

Everyone praised her for raising such fine children.

Sophia Sullivan wasn't allowed to celebrate New Year's at the Roscente house.

But she sent carefully prepared gifts every year.

Now, all of that was gone.

The more Victoria thought about it, the more exhausted she felt.

If she hadn't stopped Sophia back then.

Would everything be different now?

The whole family happy and harmonious.

Full of laughter and joy.

She closed her eyes wearily.

She truly regretted it.

But it was too late to go back.

...

"You sure you don't need me to take you home, Ethan?"

"No." Ethan steadied himself. "You can go back."

"Be careful then. I'm really leaving?"

"Yeah."

Ethan pushed open the mansion's door.

Charlie Lowell watched his retreating figure and shook his head helplessly.

He had been playing cards with his family on New Year's Eve.

When he suddenly got a call from the bar manager.

Ethan was dead drunk.

The manager had to contact Charlie, a regular.

Charlie made an excuse and slipped out.

Rushing to the bar to pick him up.

His elders were still waiting at home.

He couldn't be away for long.

But he was really worried about Ethan in this state.

The housekeepers were all on holiday.

After some thought, Charlie contacted Fiona Valentine.

It was only natural for a girlfriend to take care of her boyfriend.

Fortunately, Fiona was in Kyoto.

She agreed to come over immediately after his call.

Only then did Charlie feel relieved to leave.

"Why bother..." He sighed while driving.

Just because Sebastian Evans posted a family photo.

Ethan had completely lost it.

When Charlie arrived.

Ethan was already drunk out of his mind.

Grabbing his arm and repeatedly calling out "Sophia."

He almost kissed him.

Luckily, Charlie dodged quickly.

Then he heard Ethan mumble intermittently.

"What's so good about Sebastian Evans... Why didn't you choose me..."

It had been two years.

And he still couldn't let go.

Everyone thought they would get back together.

No one expected Sophia to leave so decisively.

Sometimes Charlie thought Sophia was really cruel.

Other times he felt sorry for Ethan.

But most of the time, he thought the separation was for the best.

Six years of entanglement.

If they couldn't be together properly.

It was better for each to find their own peace.

Life always has regrets.

No need to force it.

But...

Charlie frowned.

Was Sophia really with Sebastian Evans?

It didn't seem likely.

He knew Sophia.

But they had taken a family photo.

Met the parents.

And were spending New Year's together.

It looked like they might be getting married soon.

No wonder Ethan went crazy.

After some thought, Charlie called Sebastian.

Planning to feel him out.

If it was a misunderstanding.

Ethan wouldn't have to drown his sorrows in drink anymore.

"Seb, happy new year... just calling to wish you well!"

"Happy new year."

"Celebrating at home? Send my regards to your parents."

"Thanks."

"The old house isn't far, I'll bring over a couple of good bottles—"

"No need, I'm not at the Evans'."

"Oh?" Charlie's eyes flickered. "Where are you then?"

"My grandparents' place."

"Oh—" He feigned nonchalance. "I'll just give the wine to your parents then, you can have it when you're back. Spending New Year's with the elders, they must be nagging you about marriage again, right?"

Silence on the other end.

Charlie forced a dry laugh. "Elders are the same every year, the same old lines, so annoying..."

Sebastian chuckled softly. "I got off easy this year, no nagging."

The old couple's attention was all on their daughter.

They didn't have time for him.

Charlie's heart sank.

No nagging about marriage.

Meant he already had someone to marry.

Was he really with Sophia Sullivan?

Charlie didn't dare imagine it.

If these two appeared in front of Ethan together.

He would completely lose his mind.

...

Inside the mansion.

Ethan fumbled for the light switch in the dark.

The wind on the way back had sobered him up.

But his throat was painfully dry.

He instinctively called towards the kitchen, "Martha, get me some water—"

He waited, but no one answered.

Then he remembered the housekeeper was on holiday back home.

He got up and walked to the kitchen.

Poured two glasses of water and downed them.

Finally quenched his thirst.

But his head was still fuzzy.

He returned to the living room and lay on the sofa.

Maybe it was the curled-up position combined with the alcohol.

His stomach began to cramp with waves of pain.

He reached for the drawer under the coffee table.

Sure enough, found the usual stomach medicine.

Sophia had said his stomach was weak.

And he liked lying on the sofa after social events.

So she kept medicine in the living room too.

He never paid much attention back then.

Now he had no chance to hear her nagging.

Too lazy to get more water.

He swallowed the pills with half a glass of cold water.

The medicine gradually took effect.

The pain eased.

He collapsed weakly on the sofa.

He didn't even know where the medicine was before.

After Sophia left, he slowly learned to take care of himself.

But he still seemed bad at it.

His life was still a mess.

Ethan looked at the empty, cold mansion.

The corner of his mouth lifted in self-mockery.

He was not doing well at all...

If she knew.

Would she feel even a little bit sorry for him?

Just then.

The sound of the door opening echoed.

Ethan sat up abruptly.

"Sophia..."
###Chapter 436

It wasn't Sophia Sullivan who opened the door.

It was Fiona Valentine.

The man's gaze turned icy.

Fiona's heart tightened.

She explained softly, "Charlie said you were drunk. He was worried and asked me to check on you."

She walked over to Ethan Roscente.

She studied his expression.

"Are you alright? You don't seem too drunk?"

A flicker of disappointment passed through the man's eyes.

He responded flatly, "Hmm."

"Then I…" Fiona bit her lip, "should go back?"

"Hmm."

The woman turned and walked toward the door.

Suddenly—

"Ah!"

A startled cry came from outside.

Ethan frowned and stood up.

He pushed the door open and went out.

Fiona was sitting on the ground at the bottom of the steps.

She was examining her ankle.

"Are you okay?"

Fiona turned her head at the sound of his voice.

She forced a smile. "It's nothing, really."

Ethan's eyes swept over her ankle.

"It's swollen."

"Probably just a slight twist. It's fine…"

She tried to stand up.

A sharp pain made her suck in her breath as she put weight on it.

The man's brow furrowed deeply.

She insisted, "Really, it's fine. It'll be better after a moment."

The next second, Ethan scooped her up into his arms.

He carried her back to the living room.

Fiona was stunned.

A secret joy bubbled in her heart.

Her gamble had paid off.

Ethan considered calling the family doctor.

But he remembered it was New Year's Eve.

It was too late for that.

He asked, "Is it bad?"

Fiona shook her head. "It shouldn't be serious. It'll be fine soon."

Ethan found the first aid kit anyway.

He pulled out a tube of ointment and handed it to her.

"Put some on."

"...Okay. Thank you."

Ten minutes later.

Fiona said softly, "The ointment feels cool first, then warm. It's much better now. I didn't expect you to be so thoughtful, keeping a first aid kit at home."

Ethan's expression remained blank. "Sophia prepared it before."

Fiona fell silent.

"Since you're fine, I'll have someone take you back—"

He stopped mid-sentence.

He remembered he had given the driver the night off.

There was no one to call.

Fiona immediately stood up. "Don't trouble yourself! I can get back on my own!"

"Can you get a cab?"

"I… I should be able to…" Probably.

She had paid extra to get a cab here.

This was the villa district.

Remote and far from the city.

Ethan said, "Forget it. Try to get one. I've been drinking, so I can't drive. If you can't get one, you can stay in the guest room tonight. Leave in the morning."

A glint flickered in Fiona's eyes.

She sounded grateful. "Thank you. Don't worry, I won't disturb you at all!"

Ethan gave a noncommittal "Hmm."

He turned and went upstairs.

Fiona watched him disappear.

Then she leisurely looked around.

The living room was so large and spacious.

The crystal chandelier was so bright and beautiful.

...

Early the next morning.

Ethan came downstairs and smelled food.

He quickly walked toward the kitchen.

A woman's slender figure, wearing an apron, was busy.

Oatmeal porridge bubbled in a pot.

Eggs sizzled in a frying pan.

For a moment, it felt like the past.

Waking up early always used to find Sophia busy in the kitchen.

He would smile and lean against the doorway, quietly watching her.

Then he would go over and embrace her from behind.

Earning a flustered, playful gasp from her.

She would turn and lightly punch his chest.

He would pull her closer.

"You're up?" Fiona turned around, sounding surprised to see him.

Ethan snapped back to reality and nodded. "Hmm."

"I couldn't get a cab last night, so I stayed in the guest room. I thought your stomach might be upset from drinking, so I made breakfast. You don't mind, do you?"

"Not at all. It was thoughtful of you."

"Thank you for letting me stay. Just returning the favor! Breakfast is almost ready!"

Ethan walked to the dining table and sat down.

Soon, Fiona brought over the oatmeal porridge and fried eggs.

She served a bowl and placed it in front of him.

Then she handed him a spoon and chopsticks.

Ethan was used to being served and took them automatically.

He didn't find it unusual.

After doing this, Fiona pressed her lips together.

A hint of grievance flashed in her eyes.

She was the one who had taken the initiative.

Yet his matter-of-fact attitude stung.

Ethan saw this试探 for what it was.

He didn't take the bait.

A trace of faint mockery even passed through his eyes.

She was the one who chose to stay.

She was the one who got up early to make porridge.

He hadn't asked for any of it.

Since they were all her choices.

She should bear any resulting feelings herself.

He looked at the oatmeal porridge, his eyes softening.

He took a taste. It was even more like hers than last time.

A satisfied smile touched his lips.

Fiona saw this and felt a secret thrill.

All her practice hadn't been in vain. He must like it.

"How is it?" she asked softly.

Ethan offered no praise, simply saying, "You should eat too. I'll call you a cab after."

"..."

At the same time, at the Atlante residence.

Sophia got up and went downstairs to find everyone already awake.

Isabella Sullivan and the grandmother were making dumplings, boiling them fresh.

Steam rose from the kitchen.

Eating dumplings on New Year's Day symbolized "crossing into the new year" and "attracting wealth and treasure."

The grandfather and David Sullivan were playing chess.

The game was fierce and the situation tense.

Both were fully focused, refusing to yield.

"Sophia's up? Why not sleep a bit more?"

Sophia scratched her head. "Everyone's awake. How could I keep sleeping?"

Florence Atlante said, "It's normal for youngsters to sleep in."

Sophia didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

She was in her twenties. How was she still a youngster?

Could the grandmother's favoritism be any more obvious?

Soon, steaming hot dumplings were served.

"Breakfast is ready! Stop playing, you two!"

The grandfather's eyes didn't leave the board. "Don't rush! Don't rush! We're about to decide the winner!"

As soon as he finished speaking, David Sullivan said—

"Checkmate."

Isaac Atlante: "?"

"Dad, how about we go eat the dumplings first? They won't taste as good cold. This game doesn't count. We'll play another after eating?"

"Alright, alright! Dumplings are best eaten hot. Yes, hot."

The two men immediately got up.

The grandfather thought happily: This game doesn't count! Hehe...

After breakfast, the grandmother prepared to go to the garden.

But Isabella stopped her—

"Mom, there's something I think I should tell you and Dad."

The grandmother froze in place.
###Chapter 437

Florence Atlante was startled by her daughter's grave expression.

She had never seen Isabella Sullivan look so serious.

"Amin, what's wrong?"

"Mom, Dad, please sit down first."

The elderly couple followed her to the sofa.

"Jinxing, Clara, you come too."

Father and daughter exchanged a glance and sat down quietly.

Sophia asked softly, "Mom, what happened?"

"Most of my memories had already returned, except for the period of my disappearance. How I got to the neighboring city, how I ended up in the water... until yesterday."

Yesterday?

New Year's Eve?

Isaac's expression tightened. "What happened yesterday?"

Isabella Sullivan enunciated each word clearly. "I remembered everything."

"Who was it?"

"... Irene."

She did not hide it.

Her parents had searched for her for over twenty years. They had the right to know the truth.

Isabella Sullivan had not slept all night.

She was worried the elderly couple couldn't bear it.

She was also concerned there was no evidence, just her word against Irene's.

But she quickly realized.

Even without evidence, her parents would believe her.

Sure enough—

Isaac slammed his hand on the coffee table.

The teacups rattled loudly.

"How dare she?! What did the Atlante family ever do to wrong her?! She's despicable!"

The old man trembled with rage.

After hearing, Florence's face was deathly still.

Sophia saw the old woman's hands, hidden in her sleeves, shaking uncontrollably.

"I knew it—I knew it—" she gritted her teeth!

"I suspected her back then! But there was no evidence! If I had known, I would have risked my life to force the truth out of her!"

Florence's voice choked with tears.

Restraint, grief, regret, hatred…

Too many emotions intertwined.

"Mom, don't be like this…" Isabella Sullivan quickly soothed her, "I'm back now. She's not worth getting so upset over!"

Isaac also advised, "Don't get agitated! Calm your breathing! Don't make Amin regret telling us."

These words calmed the old woman.

Yes, if she fell ill because of this, how guilty would Amin feel?

Florence took a deep breath. "I… I'm fine… Don't worry, Minmin. Let's all stay calm."

Isabella Sullivan, her eyes red, nodded. "Okay."

Nearby, David's fists were clenched so tight they creaked. "This was premeditated murder!"

Sophia pressed her lips together tightly.

She never expected her mother's disappearance was caused by Irene.

No, it was more than just disappearance.

These over twenty years of separation, the elderly couple's suffering, all started because of her.

If the Atlante family had received the news in time back then, they likely could have saved Isabella Sullivan.

Isabella Sullivan wouldn't have had to drift away from home. The elderly couple wouldn't have suffered for decades.

Florence looked at Isaac. "Now do you understand why I distanced myself from Irene?"

"I had no evidence. I searched but found nothing. But I had a feeling. A mother's intuition."

A long time ago, Florence had suspected Irene.

The two sisters went out together, but only Isabella Sullivan was kidnapped.

If the kidnappers wanted money, shouldn't they have taken both?

If for looks, they should have taken both!

But Irene returned safe and sound.

This suspicion reached its peak when Irene married Theodore Valdemar.

With Isabella Sullivan missing, she became the biggest beneficiary.

Too many details were suspicious.

Florence: "...I had no evidence, so I couldn't go to the police. But I was sure she was the culprit! I couldn't live under the same roof as a murderer. I couldn't pretend to be mother and daughter."

If she herself forgave the murderer, how would Isabella Sullivan feel?

So she deliberately kept her distance, spoke harshly, openly cold-shouldered her.

She just wanted to make Irene uncomfortable!

She wanted to deny her everything she desired!

She couldn't control others, but she could control herself!

Isaac's eyes were full of pain. "You kept all this to yourself. Why didn't you tell me?"

"Tell you? Would you have believed me? You thought I was just being difficult, deliberately alienating Irene. I knew you wouldn't believe me."

The old man felt a tightness in his chest.

"I'm sorry… Minmin… I'm sorry, Azhen…"

Isabella Sullivan: "Dad, it's alright… I told you not to make you feel regret or sadness, but—"

She enunciated each word clearly: "So that from now on, we won't give Irene any more chances to hurt us."

Florence tightly grasped her daughter's hand, tears streaming as she nodded. "Yes, from today onward, no one can hurt us again!"

Isaac suddenly stood up. "No! We can't just let this go!"

"What do you want to do?"

"Make her pay!"

Florence immediately stopped him. "Don't be foolish! We've only just been reunited. Don't do anything illegal."

"Then we just let her go?!" Isaac's teeth were gritted audibly.

"Since we're sure it was her, there must be traces left behind."

Isaac frowned. "What do you mean?"

Florence: "The kidnappers haven't been caught yet. We keep looking! Amin, do you still remember what they looked like?"

Isabella Sullivan nodded. "I remember!"

"Good. Before, we couldn't find them because we had too little information. Now with Amin's identification, it will be much easier."

Florence paused, then suddenly asked, "Is your birthday coming up soon?"

Isaac was stunned. "Why bring that up suddenly?"

The old woman's eyes narrowed slightly. "Our family hasn't had a proper celebration in a long time. Let's use this opportunity to throw a birthday banquet. Invite all the elite of Kyoto."

The old man still didn't understand. "And then?"

"Announce Amin's identity, formally introduce Clara and Jinxing. And also…"

A flash of ruthlessness passed through Florence's eyes.
###Chapter 438

Isabella Sullivan told the elderly couple the truth about what happened that year.

Anger and hatred were inevitable reactions.

Fortunately, the elderly couple's health was not seriously affected.

Neither of them fainted.

Isabella's anxious heart finally settled.

The elderly couple gradually calmed down.

By the Lantern Festival, they had returned to their normal selves.

The family joyfully celebrated the holiday together.

Isabella and David Sullivan did not return to their city.

The couple decided to stay in Kyoto a while longer after discussing it.

Part of the reason was to keep the elderly couple company.

They were also concerned about the elders' emotional stability.

The old lady's咬牙切齿 expression that day had been truly frightening.

She seemed calm after venting.

But Isabella felt a lingering unease.

David thought she was overthinking it.

"Mom and Dad seem happy every day now. They don't seem troubled."

Isabella shook her head. "You don't understand."

"What don't I understand?"

"I can't explain it. I just have a bad feeling."

This feeling was like...

The calm before a storm.

The calmer it was, the more dangerous it became.

Because—

No one knew when it would erupt!

…

The twentieth day of the first lunar month was Isaac Atlante's eightieth birthday.

The Atlante family had always kept a low profile.

Their social circle had almost forgotten about this family.

Suddenly, they were throwing a grand birthday banquet.

Everyone was surprised when the invitations arrived.

The Atlante family was an old, established family with a century of history and deep roots.

The famous tourist attraction in Kyoto, "Atlante Gardens,"

was once merely the Atlante family's summer retreat.

They still owned five or six such gardens across the country.

They had even more during the Republican era.

Most were destroyed during the war, leaving only these few.

Years ago, an Atlante daughter suddenly disappeared.

Some rumors said she was kidnapped.

Some said she ran away to avoid an arranged marriage.

Others said she was murdered.

Isaac Atlante and Florence Atlante were devastated from then on.

It was said they retired abroad and never returned.

No one expected…

Such big news to break at the start of the year.

Everyone was astonished.

"I heard this banquet isn't just for the birthday."

"The Atlante family is also recognizing their long-lost second daughter."

"Recognizing her and bringing her back into the family? What's the story?"

"You haven't heard? It's all anyone's talking about outside!"

"The second daughter was found, and she has a family of her own."

"Found after disappearing for over twenty years? Could it be a fake?"

"What era is this? Can't they do a DNA test?"

"My mother is distantly related to the Atlantes. I can confirm it's true."

"Even if it's real, what happened to her all those missing years?"

"I heard she brought back a daughter. It doesn't sound good."

"Has anyone seen her? I heard she's quite ordinary."

"Get out of here! Even if she were great, she wouldn't be for you!"

"Who said anything about the second daughter? She's of our parents' generation!"

"Then you…?"

"Hehe… I was thinking about the granddaughter!"

"I heard she's beautiful, has a great figure, and is doted on by the elders."

"Gaining her favor could save you a decade of hard work!"

"A toad lusting after swan meat? Is someone like you even worthy?"

"If I'm not worthy, does that mean you are?"

"You're right. I actually am."

…

Charlie Lowell finished his last sip of red wine.

His gaze fell on the gilded invitation.

"The Atlante family is quite interesting… I'll wait and see the show."

The Lowell, Roscente, and Winston families were all on the guest list.

Charlie, Ethan Roscente, and Julian Winston weren't initially interested.

But the rumors grew wilder.

People said all sorts of things.

Some said the second daughter was sold into the mountains as a wife.

Abandoned for giving birth to a daughter.

Some said the second daughter was a celestial beauty, but her daughter had mental problems.

Rumors flew, but no photos surfaced.

The more mysterious it was, the more intriguing it became.

Curiosity sparked in Charlie. "Are you two going to the banquet tomorrow?"

Ethan Roscente: "We'll see."

Julian Winston: "Not sure."

"What's with you two? Not looking for any fun anymore?"

Julian shrugged: "I have a girlfriend now. No time to hang out with singles."

"Charlie, you should get a clue."

"Want to play cards?" Ethan urged impatiently.

He had no interest in anything besides Sophia Sullivan.

The banquet would just be another social obligation.

Charlie sat up straight. "Sure. What's the bet?"

Julian smiled. "The loser has to ask the Atlante granddaughter for her WeChat. How about that?"

Charlie raised an eyebrow. "I'm fine with that. See if Ethan will play."

Ethan agreed casually. "Sure."

…

The next day, the banquet was filled with celebrities.

Sophia Sullivan wore a light blue strapless evening gown.

The cut-out design at the waist accentuated her slender figure.

Isabella Sullivan wore a cheongsam with her hair elegantly swept up.

She looked dignified, elegant, and extraordinary.

David Sullivan was in a well-tailored suit and a neat tie.

He appeared gentle, refined, and scholarly.

Standing next to Isabella, they made a perfect couple.

"Are you ready?" The old gentleman and lady entered.

Seeing their daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter standing together.

The outstanding looks and presence of the family of three.

The elderly couple paused, feeling both comforted and bittersweet…

They had missed so much of their daughter's life…

Today, they would restore her rightful place.

Along with her husband and daughter.
###Chapter 439

Florence held Isabella's hand.

Over twenty years had passed.

She never dared to dream this day would come.

Heaven had finally been kind to her.

The family was reunited at last.

The old man saw her eyes welling up.

He teased her gently.

Did you forget the doctor's advice again?

Today is such a joyous occasion.

You should be smiling.

Isabella nodded.

Father is right.

Mom, please smile.

The old lady chuckled.

At my age,

crying is ugly.

Smiling is even uglier.

Nonsense.

It's the grace that comes with age.

The elegance bestowed by time.

The old lady beamed instantly.

David Sullivan secretly gave his wife a thumbs up.

Well done.

A knock suddenly sounded at the door.

Sebastian Evans' voice came through.

Grandfather.

It's me.

Isaac Atlante cleared his throat lightly.

Come in.

Sebastian pushed the door open.

His gaze swept over Sophia Sullivan, standing between David and Isabella.

A flash of admiration passed through his eyes.

It vanished quickly.

All the guests have arrived.

The ceremony can begin whenever you're ready.

Good.

Isaac nodded.

Then let's go out now.

We shouldn't keep the guests waiting.

The banquet hall was brilliantly lit.

Bustling with noise and conversation.

The Atlante family had invited many guests.

From all walks of life.

But most were from their social circle.

Many familiar faces could be seen in the crowd.

Even the Ye family from Minshan is here?

They've been very low-key these past years.

They decline every invitation.

Always citing their ancestral rules.

Why did they make an exception for the Atlantes?

Charlie Lowell held a champagne flute.

A faint, knowing smile played on his lips.

He was clearly enjoying the spectacle.

And that A-list director from the Zhou family.

He has quite the reputation.

I personally went to his door to ask him to shoot an ad.

Got a polite refusal.

Invited him to dinner.

Told me he was too busy.

Declines all social engagements.

But coming to the Atlantes doesn't count as a social engagement?

Enough.

Julian Winston shot him a look.

I could smell the jealousy from across the room.

Your little bit of face can't compare to the Atlantes'.

Charlie's face darkened.

Julian delivered the final blow.

I'm not wrong.

It's the plain truth.

Charlie noticed his empty hands.

He looked at him as if seeing a ghost.

You're not having a drink?

Julian glanced around.

Oh.

I'm driving later.

Not drinking.

Since when did that stop you before?

I'm talking to you.

Why are you looking around?

Julian wasn't listening.

He seemed to have spotted something.

His eyes lit up.

Well.

I have something to do.

I'll be right back.

Without waiting for Charlie's response, he strode towards the entrance.

A bright smile spread across his face.

Olivia.

You're here.

Heh.

Olivia Lopez looked at the man who had suddenly appeared.

She raised an eyebrow.

You got an invitation too?

Yes.

Olivia's expression turned strange.

Who sent it to you?

The Atlantes, of course.

It's Patriarch Atlante's birthday banquet.

Who else would send the invitations but the Atlante family?

Olivia understood immediately.

The Winston family was a prominent wealthy family in the city.

Receiving an invitation was normal.

So the Jiang and Lowell families received them too?

Julian nodded.

Yes.

Is there a problem?

Is Ethan Roscente coming?

Olivia asked suddenly.

The man's smile faltered.

He frowned subconsciously.

Why are you asking about him?

What?

Can't I ask?

Julian looked at her suspiciously.

What are you planning?

You're close with Sophia.

You should know what kind of person Ethan is.

No woman with any taste would be interested in him.

You—

Ugh.

What bad luck.

What are you thinking?

Interested in him?

Am I that desperate?

Good that you're not.

Heh.

Julian looked behind her.

Did you come alone?

Yes.

Did the Lopez family send you as their representative?

Hmph.

I'm not here for the Lopez family today.

Julian was confused.

Then for whom?

It can't be for our Winston family, can it?

Heh.

Actually, thinking about it, it's not impossible.

You're my girlfriend now.

The future Winston daughter-in-law.

Representing the Winstons is very appropriate.

Hmph.

In your dreams.

I'm not representing anyone.

I came on my own.

What do you mean?

Olivia waved her invitation.

Everyone else's was bright red.

Hers was pink.

See?

A personal invitation.

You?

Julian was slightly surprised.

What?

Is that so strange?

Personal invitations were usually sent by the host family to close relatives or very important figures.

It signified special status and regard.

How did Olivia get one?

Are you related to the Atlantes?

That can't be right.

I've never heard of any relation between the Lopez and Atlante families.

Even if there was.

The special invitation should have gone to the Lopez family.

Why would only Olivia get one?

The woman smiled faintly.

Guess.

Julian was speechless.

Ethan.

Over here.

Charlie waved towards a certain direction.

Ethan Roscente walked over.

Charlie.

I thought you weren't coming.

Ethan seemed disinterested.

Just going through the motions.

I'll leave once the banquet starts.

In such a hurry?

Yeah.

Going to G City tonight.

There's some issue with the branch office.

I see.

Charlie signaled a waiter.

He picked up a glass of red wine and offered it.

Ethan, try this.

The wine is quite good.

Ethan waved it away.

Not drinking.

Charlie was taken aback.

What's with everyone today?

Turning over a new leaf?

Reinventing themselves?

He suddenly felt a sense of abandonment.

Today, of all occasions.

Those who could come.

And those who normally wouldn't.

Are all here.

It seems Patriarch Atlante places great importance on this birthday banquet.

Yeah.

Ethan said coldly.

It's also a way to tell everyone.

How much the Atlante family values this daughter they just found.

Charlie suddenly thought of something.

Speaking of which, Sebastian's mother is also an Atlante daughter.

So the one being introduced today is his aunt?

Ethan's face remained expressionless.

Charlie realized he might have said something wrong.

Ahem.

I was just saying.

Ethan, don't mind me.

The hall was stuffy.

The environment noisy.

Ethan smelled the mix of various perfumes.

He couldn't help but frown.

I'm going out for some air.

Before he could finish, the lights suddenly dimmed.

The birthday banquet officially began.

Isaac Atlante took to the stage first.

The old man was spirited.

His voice strong and clear.

He said a few polite words first.

Then eagerly moved on to the main topic.

Today, taking this opportunity.

I want to formally introduce my long-lost daughter.

As you all know.

Some incidents occurred in the early years.

Causing us to be separated for over twenty years.

Now she has returned.

And officially rejoins this circle.

I hope everyone here will look out for her in the future.

Isabella.

Come—
###Chapter 440

Old Master Atlante raised his hand in a signal.

All eyes followed his gesture.

Isabella and David Sullivan stepped forward together.

The entire room's attention snapped to them instantly.

Isaac Atlante beamed. "This is my daughter, Emilia, and my son-in-law, David Sullivan."

"There have been rumors circulating. I've heard some of them."

The guests below the stage exchanged subtle glances.

Many of those outrageous rumors had been fueled by people in this very room.

Isaac continued. "Rumors are just rumors. Since everyone is curious, I'll share a few more details."

"My daughter, Emilia, writes under the pen name Isabella Sullivan. She is now a full-time author. She's been quite fortunate, reaching the top of the bestseller list for mystery novels."

The crowd was stunned.

Fortunate? That was an understatement.

Isaac turned to David. "My son-in-law is a graduate of Caltech. He currently teaches physics at a prestigious magnet high school in the city. He educates and nurtures young minds."

After the introduction, Madam Florence Atlante slowly ascended the stage.

"Furthermore, I would like to introduce my granddaughter."

"She is the little princess of the Atlante family, the apple of our eyes—Sophia Sullivan."

As she finished speaking, Sebastian Evans escorted Sophia Sullivan onto the stage.

His role as her brother was now solidified.

He had anticipated this, but a bitter ache remained in his heart.

From now on, in the eyes of the world, they could only be siblings.

Sophia met the varied gazes from the audience with a composed smile.

She stood on the stage with innate grace.

Her presence spoke louder than any words.

She calmly assessed every pair of eyes scrutinizing her.

After a brief silence, a wave of discussion erupted.

"That poise is truly befitting of an Atlante!"

"Those previous rumors were utterly ridiculous. The second young miss's family is clearly accomplished."

"To be so outstanding after being missing for over twenty years is remarkable."

"Isabella? The author of 'The Seven-Day Discourse'?"

"It must be her, the top mystery author!"

"Oh my god! It really is her! My father's bookshelf is filled with her works."

"Her husband is impressive too, a Caltech graduate."

"The whole family is so good-looking…"

"Is Miss Sullivan married?"

"What? Are you interested?"

"Aren't you?"

The two society matrons shared a knowing smile.

The status of the Atlante family's little princess was enough to intrigue everyone present.

Especially those with eligible unmarried sons.

An alliance with the Atlante family was a dream for many!

Ethan Roscente and Charlie Lowell were dumbfounded.

Charlie swallowed hard. "...Sophia is an Atlante?"

"This was kept so tightly under wraps!"

He could have just asked Sebastian, but Sebastian had long stopped attending their gatherings.

Even if they met, he wouldn't have brought it up unprompted.

"Sophia is actually the Atlante's granddaughter?" Charlie exclaimed again.

The more he thought about it, the more unbelievable it seemed!

Wait…

"Then Sebastian and her are… siblings?"

Charlie was utterly shocked by this revelation.

The legendary case of lovers turning into siblings?

His first thought was that Sebastian would lose his mind.

His second thought was—

Charlie glanced furtively at Ethan.

Ethan was staring intently at the stage. His gaze shifted from stunned to confused, then from realization to disconcertion, finally settling into uncontainable joy.

Charlie had never seen such a complex play of emotions on his face.

"...Ethan? Ethan!"

Ethan snapped back to attention. "What did you say?"

"About Sophia and Sebastian, they…"

"Yes, siblings. No wonder there was a family portrait…"

No wonder they were always together and had met the parents.

He couldn't suppress the smile tugging at his lips.

Charlie muttered, "Dude, tone it down."

Ethan replied, "I can't."

"You're being a bit schadenfreude here."

Ethan said coolly, "Compared to Sebastian's deliberate provocations, I'm being rather merciful."

Charlie thought: You're just overthinking things.

In a corner, Irene Valdemar watched the stage expressionlessly.

From the old master introducing the Sullivans, to the madam announcing Sophia's identity, to her own son personally supporting Sophia on stage—her emotions ran from cold, mocking scorn, to stunned jealousy, finally culminating in complete devastation!

What a splendid birthday banquet! What a magnificent homecoming!

"...Irene? Irene!"

"Hmm? What did you say just now?" Irene forced a smile and looked at Sylvia Laurent.

Sylvia frowned deeply, her eyes filled with shock and doubt.

Sylvia asked, "Are your parents certain they haven't mistaken these people?"

This Second Young Miss of the Atlante family…

They had met once before in a clothing store at the mall. The other woman had picked out very suitable clothes for her then.

During their conversation, Sylvia found her quite insightful and had even wanted to befriend her. To think…

She was the long-lost daughter of the Atlante family.

What shocked her even more was that Sophia was her daughter!

The woman she admired at first sight and the tea-artist girl who made a terrible first impression were…

Sylvia's feelings were extremely complicated.

She didn't know whether to change her opinion of the daughter because she appreciated the mother, or to let her dislike for Sophia affect her view of the mother.

"Mistaken?" Irene feigned surprise. "How could that be? The old master and madam must have verified everything carefully."

"It seems your parents value this sister very much?"

Irene suppressed her jealousy. "Do they?"

"With this kind of setup today, introduced personally by the elders, it's quite a formal acknowledgment."

"It's only right they value her, after she's been missing for so many years and is finally found."

Sylvia sighed softly. "It's good that you can see it that way."

Irene's smile was stiff, her teeth clenched tightly.

See it that way?

Preposterous!

Her parents clearly treated her like an outsider. She only received the birthday banquet invitation two days prior.

She knew nothing about the arrangements for the recognition.

How could she possibly see it that way?
###Chapter 441

Irene Valdemar's face was pale with fury.
Her eyes blazed with anger.

Sylvia Laurent stood nearby, completely oblivious to her distress.

She chimed in absently, "They really should make it up to her properly..."

Her gaze remained fixed on her younger son.

Alexander Laurent was also present today.

He held a personal invitation, pink like Olivia Lopez's.

Neither was attending on behalf of their family.

Sylvia knew her son best.

Seeing him stare unblinkingly at the stage, he was definitely watching Sophia Sullivan.

That infatuated look.
That utterly besotted expression.

She clenched her fists in anger—

So pathetic!
So humiliating!

Then she looked at Olivia Lopez...

It was even worse to watch.

That trembling excitement made her seem even more worthless than Alexander!

What kind of spell had Sophia Sullivan cast?

Why were they all so bewitched by her?

Olivia was so excited she was about to jump up.

If not for the formal setting, she would have rushed the stage already, shouting: You're the best, Clara! I love you, Clara! Clara, you're my goddess!

Julian Winston scoffed. "Anyone would think it was you being recognized by your real family."

"Shut up! I'm just happy for Clara."

With the Atlante family backing her, let's see who would dare bully her now.

"Ethan Roscente can't, you can't, and even I can't!"

Julian frowned. "When have I ever bullied her?"

"Back when you and Ethan Roscente were out partying, did you ever warn Clara? Did you ever urge Ethan to go home? Did you?"

"That was between husband and wife. What business was it of mine?"

"Besides, with Ethan's temper, who could have talked any sense into him?"

Men always preferred to play it safe.

Afraid of offending people.
Afraid of being caught in the middle.

But a true friend wouldn't stand by and watch someone suffer.

Olivia sneered. "You men, you're all the same."

Julian Winston, "..."

What did that have to do with him?

But Sophia Sullivan actually being an Atlante was truly shocking.

Ethan Roscente must be over the moon right now.

On stage, after the old couple finished their words of thanks, they suddenly pulled Isabella Sullivan forward.

Facing the crowd, they solemnly announced—

"From today onward, Minmin is the Atlante family's one and only daughter. We ask for your continued support and kindness."

The entire hall fell silent.
The air froze solid.

One and only daughter?

What did that mean?

Weren't there two Atlante daughters?

Irene Valdemar married into the wealthy Valdemar family.

How could she suddenly not count?

Sebastian Evans froze, his gaze shifting between the old couple in shock.

He barely held back the urge to demand an explanation.

Isabella Sullivan exchanged a look with David Sullivan.

So this was it.

The old lady's trump card was here.

This storm had finally arrived.

But...

Publicly disowning Irene was too ruthless.

Florence Atlante never concerned herself with such things.

Irene harmed her Minmin, so she shouldn't blame her for being merciless.

It was a relationship without blood ties to begin with.

Raising Irene and marrying her into a wealthy family was already more than enough kindness.

From now on, they were just strangers!

Below the stage, Irene was still furious about the old couple's secrecy.

Today, she was the only one here with an invitation.

Theodore Valdemar was nowhere to be seen.

He hadn't been home since their last confrontation.

Irene thought he would have told the old couple.

But after observing for so long, the old couple never confronted her.

Knowing them, if they knew the truth, they would never let her off the hook.

She spent day after day in anxiety.

The Lantern Festival passed, and everything remained calm.

Irene finally relaxed.

Presumably, Isabella Sullivan had no proof and didn't dare upset the old couple.

Heaven was helping her!

But now, what was she hearing?

The Atlante family's one and only daughter?

It was Isabella?!

The old couple clearly meant exactly that!

A guest couldn't help but ask—

"Sir, did you misspeak? Doesn't the Atlante family have two daughters?"

Instantly, all eyes focused on Isabella Sullivan on stage and Irene Valdemar below.

Isaac Atlante smiled. "I may be old, but my mind is clear. I can tell loyalty from treachery, good from evil. Some ungrateful wretches are better off forgotten!"

These words practically pointed directly at Irene, calling her "treacherous," an "ungrateful wretch"!

Better off forgotten...

The old man was publicly announcing he was severing ties with Irene Valdemar!

The guests erupted in murmurs.

"That seems excessive!"
"There must be more to the story!"
"Cutting off the adopted daughter as soon as the biological one returns? Anyone can guess the adopted daughter did something wrong."
"I heard the Valdemars originally wanted Isabella Sullivan. They only settled for Irene Valdemar because Isabella went missing..."
###Chapter 442

The whispers around her drilled into Irene's ears.

Her expression stiffened.

A vein throbbed at her temple.

How could this be…

Did the old man and the old lady know everything?

Impossible…

Absolutely impossible…

But the stares felt like knives slicing into her.

Bare.

Undisguised.

She had married into the Evans family over twenty years ago.

She had always been the pampered Mrs. Evans.

Her husband was outstanding.

Her son was exceptional.

Wherever she went, she was the center of attention.

When had she ever been subjected to such pointed fingers?

Irene took a deep breath.

She forced a smile.

She moved to meet Isaac Atlante as he descended from the stage.

"Happy birthday, Father! Your eightieth birthday, and my sister has returned. A double celebration!"

Isaac lifted his eyelids.

He gave her a cold glance.

He avoided her outstretched hand.

"Was what I said not clear enough?"

Irene's face paled.

Isaac was merciless.

"Let me say it again. The Atlante family only has one daughter: Emilia. Don't call me Father."

"You… please don't be angry… If I've done something wrong, I will change…"

She tried to frame the disowning as a mere father-daughter quarrel.

Even now.

She still wanted to paper over the cracks.

Sure enough—

The guests heard this.

So it was just a family spat.

Could they really cut ties?

It must be angry words.

They would make up soon.

"I thought there was some big gossip…"

"Turns out it's just family drama."

"Nothing to see here."

The crowd began to disperse.

Suddenly, Florence Atlante let out a cold laugh.

"I've seen thick-skinned people, but never one as thick as you."

"We weren't spelling it out to save Sebastian some face. If you had quietly accepted it, we could have maintained appearances. But you were never satisfied. You always wanted to flaunt the Atlante name. Then don't blame me for being blunt."

"Mother? You—"

Irene tried to stop her.

But Florence spoke in a rapid torrent.

Years of pent-up resentment came pouring out.

"You think we don't know what you did to Emilia all those years ago? How dare you say these things? Playing dumb and trying to muddle through?"

"We were negligent back then. We let you harm Emilia once. We will never let you harm her a second time!"

Florence's voice was sharp and clear.

The venue fell dead silent.

The guests pricked up their ears.

Afraid to miss a single word.

Irene trembled all over.

Her teeth chattered.

It's over…

It's all over…

The last fig leaf had been torn away.

All the ugliness was laid bare under the sun.

For everyone to see.

Her face.

Her reputation.

Her dignity.

Her status…

Shattered into pieces.

Irene's eyes reddened.

She couldn't accept this!

Why did Emilia, missing for over twenty years, get to return as the Atlante heiress?

Then what did all her past efforts count for?

A wasted effort?

Futile labor?

"You forced me into this! I—"

"Mother!" Sebastian Evans suddenly raised his voice to interrupt.

He stepped forward and took her arm.

He looked down and spoke softly.

"You're tired. Let me take you to rest."

"Sebastian, let go. Today, I must—"

"Mother!" he warned in a low voice.

"The situation is bad enough. Do you want to make it worse?"

Irene choked.

Finally, she was half-supported, half-dragged upstairs by Sebastian.

After she left.

Isaac smiled at the crowd.

"Sorry for the spectacle. Please, take your seats. Enjoy the food and drinks."

"Don't mention it, don't mention it…"

After hearing such juicy gossip.

They really weren't being treated as outsiders.

The farce was over.

The guests happily took their seats.

Only Sylvia Laurent remained standing.

She looked dazed.

Irene had been standing right beside her.

She had seen clearly the shock, panic, fear, and resentment on the other woman's face…

Too many emotions that shouldn't have been there.

Did Irene really…?

But in her memory, Irene was always graceful, virtuous, and kind!

For the first time, Sylvia doubted her own judgment.

"Mrs. Laurent? Why are you standing? Please, take a seat."

"…Alright, coming!"

Also stunned were Victoria Roscente and her daughter, Amelia.

Amelia had hidden away the entire Spring Festival.

After the Lantern Festival.

She locked herself in her room all day.

Meals were brought in by the maid.

She was like a useless person.

Victoria had finally coaxed her out.

To attend old Mr. Atlante's birthday banquet for a change of scenery.

But they hadn't expected…

To be met with a brutal blow.

"Mom…" Amelia clutched Victoria's arm helplessly.

"Tell me this is a dream… It's all fake…"

Victoria was dumbfounded.

Even though the stage was now empty.

She still stared blankly in that direction.

As if needing to confirm something again and again.

"Yes… it must be a dream…" she murmured in agreement.

How could Sophia Sullivan be from the Atlante family?

The old-money, prestigious Atlante family!

Wealth rarely lasts three generations.

But the Atlante ancestors were high officials and nobles.

In modern times, they promoted industry to save the nation.

They weren't just wealthy.

They were also well-connected and respected.

They had kept a low profile for the last twenty to thirty years.

Rarely appearing in public.

Such a family.

Such background and influence.

So many people tried to climb this social ladder but couldn't.

Yet Sophia Sullivan was cherished by the head of the family.

Victoria remembered one Lantern Festival.

Sophia had brought gifts to visit.

But she hadn't even let her through the door.

"Paying a New Year's visit? Look at yourself. Are you worthy? Only Ethan is easily fooled, treating you like a treasure. Not everyone is that stupid!"

"Want to marry into the Roscente family? Which prominent family are you from? Or are you from some political or business dynasty? Since you're neither, be sensible. Don't covet things that don't belong to you. You'll bring harm to others and yourself, and come to a bad end!"

Sophia had looked at her calmly.

Let her finish all the harsh words.

Then replied calmly—

"Is the standard of worthiness only based on family background? My family is ordinary, but I don't think I'm inferior to any socialite. Just like you, with your title of Mrs. Roscente, a wealthy socialite. But in my eyes, you are just Ethan's mother."

"Even if one day you were destitute, begging on the streets or scavenging, your identity in my heart wouldn't change. You would still be Ethan's mother."

Only Ethan's mother.

Nothing more.

"Precisely because of that, I was willing to bring gifts to your door and speak to you politely."

Back then, Victoria only heard the part: "you were destitute, begging on the streets or scavenging…"

In a fit of anger.

She had directly thrown Sophia out.

Ethan had wanted to chase after her.

But she forbade it.

Issuing a harsh ultimatum—

"If you chase after her today, I will disown you as my son!"

Ethan had stopped.

He called out helplessly, "Mom…"

But he didn't chase after her.

Victoria thought she had won.

But now.

She realized how terribly wrong she had been.

How completely she had lost.
###Chapter 443
A Brutal Cut

"Mrs. Roscente? Mrs. Roscente!"

"...What?" Victoria Roscente jolted awake.

"It's time to be seated."

"Alright."

Victoria quickly took Amelia Roscente's hand and found their seats.

The attendant scratched his head, muttering to himself. Why are all the ladies acting so strange today?

...

The banquet concluded.

Upstairs, in the lounge—

"Mom, we should go," Sebastian Evans urged quietly.

"I'm not leaving! How dare they treat me like this? After all these years as father and daughter, mother and daughter, is this how they end it?"

"That's what I'd like to know," Sebastian's voice was heavy.

Irene Valdemar's eyes darted away.

"Still no answer from your father?"

"No."

Finally—

The old couple appeared.

Isabella Sullivan and her family had already left.

Florence Atlante looked coldly at Irene. "Sebastian said you wanted to see us."

"Mom—"

"Don't call me that. I don't deserve it."

The old woman's disgust was plain.

Irene took a deep breath. "Fine."

She was completely calm now.

"Sit. Let's talk."

Florence wanted to hear what excuses she could possibly offer.

The couple sat down.

Irene spoke first. "You know everything?"

The old woman scoffed. "Know what? Why don't you tell us yourself?"

Irene glanced around the room, her eyes settling back on Florence. "I don't know if this room is monitored, or if you're wearing a wire. Some things are better left unsaid. We all know the truth."

The old couple laughed in disbelief.

Sebastian frowned.

Irene's lips curved into a faint smile. "Since that's the case, I'll be direct. You humiliated me completely at the birthday banquet today. Have you considered the consequences?"

Florence shot back, "What consequences?"

"I am still Mrs. Valdemar. The link between our two families. Do you think this is appropriate?"

"Link?" The old woman laughed.

"Exactly! You can disown me, but you must keep up appearances, right? A rift between our families will affect stock prices, the company's reputation!"

"And so?"

Irene continued, "To the outside world, I am still a daughter of the Atlante family. Tomorrow, I need you to publicly clarify that today was just a misunderstanding."

Florence sneered. "So you can continue being Mrs. Valdemar? Maintain your noble status? Wei Furong, do you take us for fools?!"

Wei Furong. Irene's original name.

Florence had rescued her, not yet three years old, on the Yunnan-Myanmar border.

Her parents had died in a conflict. The child was destined for an orphanage.

The tiny girl had clung to Florence's leg, refusing to let go. Florence's heart had softened.

The next day, she discovered she was pregnant.

After years without children, it felt like a blessing from heaven.

Little Furong was her lucky star!

The couple decided to adopt her, renaming her Irene.

It meant to remember her origins, to be grateful.

They hoped she would never forget her roots.

But the opposite had happened—

Looking at the stranger her daughter had become, Florence's heart turned to ice.

Isaac Atlante steadied his wife, his voice cold. "We don't care about our relationship with the Valdemars. If it weren't for Sebastian's sake, my words today would have been far harsher!"

"Trying to negotiate? Show us your bargaining chips. The Valdemar name means nothing to us."

Irene shot to her feet. "You—"

Sebastian held her back. "Mom, stop."

"You're my son. Won't you even support me?"

Sebastian's dark eyes were intense. "I just have one question. Does Aunt Emilia's disappearance have anything to do with you?"

"Sebastian!"

"Yes, or no?"

"Sebastian Evans!"

"So it's yes."

"You—" Irene hadn't expected her son to turn against her.

Sebastian took a few steps back, lowering his gaze.

So that's how it is...

No wonder Grandma never liked Mother. No wonder his parents always argued. No wonder Irene was so full of resentment!

All the signs were there!

...

The night wind was sharp and bitingly cold.

After seeing Irene out, Sebastian was asked to stay by the old man.

Isaac said three things—

"You're a good kid. Thank you for looking after us all these years."

"We didn't tell you what we planned to say at the banquet today. First, we didn't know how to bring it up. Second, we wanted to see how you'd react."

"Sebastian, you didn't disappoint us. Will you still be our grandson?"

They rejected Irene, but they couldn't let go of Sebastian.

...

Down in the garden, Sebastian lit a cigarette.

Smoke curled around him as he stared blankly.

He forgot to smoke, letting it burn slowly.

His downcast eyes hid his emotions.

"What a coincidence."

A light, mocking sound came from the shadows.

Ethan Roscente stepped out, a half-smoked cigarette between his fingers.

A faint, sardonic smile played on his lips.

"Quite the performance. I almost bought it. But fakes can't become real. I never thought Sebastian Evans would stoop to such tricks."

Sebastian looked up coldly.

"Ethan Roscente."

"Not a coincidence. I was waiting for you."

"...Something on your mind?" He wasn't in the mood for a fight tonight.

Ethan raised an eyebrow, unusually calm.

Years of friendship meant they knew each other too well.

With the sibling revelation public, Sebastian's mood was understandable.

Ethan had deliberately provoked him outside Sophia Sullivan's place before. He never expected the backlash to hit himself.

"Congratulations on finding your sister. A cause for celebration," he added, twisting the knife.

Another brutal cut.

He showed no mercy.
###Chapter 444

Sebastian Evans's gaze was heavy.

Ethan Roscente felt uneasy under his stare.

"Heh," Sebastian suddenly laughed. "You're here to watch the show."

Ethan nodded frankly. "Yes."

"If you're here for the show, why leave before it's over?"

Ethan frowned. "What do you mean?"

"Grandpa and Grandma had a falling out with my mother."

"So?" What did that have to do with him?

Sebastian sighed softly. "My mother is an adopted daughter of the Atlante family."

Ethan froze instantly.

"Sophia and I share no blood relation." He exhaled a plume of smoke, his tone flat.

"Tch—" Ethan sneered. "Blood relation doesn't matter. The moment the old man publicly announced Sophia Sullivan's status, you could only be her cousin! The outside world will only see you as siblings."

"Even though Sophia and I are separated, we were together for so many years. I know her. With the label of 'cousin,' even if it's just in name, she won't choose you."

"Sebastian Evans, you're out of the game. Understand?"

The corner of Ethan's mouth lifted in a mocking, challenging smile.

Sebastian looked at him coldly. After a long moment, he suddenly laughed.

"If you know her, you should know how much she values family. Even if we can't be together, I can stay by her side as family. Care for her. Protect her. As for you—"

"Getting close to her is a luxury you can't afford."

"From beginning to end, the one who hasn't faced reality is you—Ethan Roscente."

Sebastian's words struck deep, each one a precise hit.

Ethan trembled all over, his eyes red. "The days are long. We'll see!"

He threw down the harsh words, turned, and left.

He had never won, yet he insisted on coming to provoke.

And Sebastian…

He had won, yet he couldn't bring himself to smile.

...

Meanwhile, Sophia Sullivan returned to the Atlante residence with her parents.

Isabella Sullivan was exhausted. She rubbed her legs as soon as she entered. "Socializing is more tiring than writing. These heels hurt my feet. I'm avoiding these events whenever possible from now on…"

David Sullivan knelt to massage them for her, agreeing readily. "Yes, yes, we'll go less often. Go lie down in the room. I'll give you a proper massage."

"Okay…"

The couple chatted, heading upstairs by themselves.

Sophia, left behind in the living room: ?

Her phone suddenly rang.

Seeing the name on the screen, her gaze softened.

"Hello, Professor?"

"Sophia, congratulations."

"Thank you for coming."

She had only invited Olivia Lopez and Alexander Laurent separately.

Both had come.

"You today... are very beautiful." The man's voice was slightly halting, as if unaccustomed to saying such things.

Sophia was taken aback. A smile unconsciously touched her lips. "Only today?"

"...Ah?" He paused on the other end, flustered. "No... I meant you're especially beautiful today. You're always beautiful…"

"Really?" she asked, laughing.

"Yes!" he answered earnestly.

Sophia couldn't help but laugh.

On the other end, Alexander Laurent held his phone, scratching his head in embarrassment.

...

The Lunar New Year period ended, and with it, the winter break.

School was about to start. David Sullivan had to return to his city.

Isabella planned to go to Hong Kong with Stone Macmillan to discuss international copyrights.

Though the old couple was reluctant, they understood their daughter and son-in-law had their own work and lives. They were accustomed to living in their city and couldn't stay long in Kyoto.

It was already rare for them to come for New Year's Eve and stay for these extra days.

They couldn't ask for more.

Just one day after the couple left, the old house suddenly felt too quiet. Florence Atlante felt unaccustomed to it.

Life had been like this before, but now...

It could only be said that it's easy to adapt to luxury, but hard to return to simplicity!

Having tasted the comfort of having her daughter and son-in-law around, how could she bear the loneliness and quiet now?

"No," the old lady said suddenly, getting up. "I'm going to their city!"

Isaac Atlante looked utterly helpless. "Don't be unreasonable. Isabella hasn't returned from Hong Kong yet. What will you do there alone?"

"I... I can go see David, can't I? Or... go to Hong Kong! I can't stand being in this house anymore!"

Isaac sighed. "David leaves early and returns late, teaching and nurturing minds. He's taking on homeroom teacher duties this semester. Wouldn't you just be adding to his burden if you went now?"

"I—I won't disturb him. Can't I just stay home? I could even cook for him, wait for Isabella to return from Hong Kong…"

"You, at your age, are regressing. Can't you be apart from the children?"

Florence snorted lightly. "I don't believe you don't want to go!"

Isaac was speechless.

Alright, he did want to go.

The old lady: "If the mountain won't come to me, I'll go to the mountain. Are you coming with me or not?"

Isaac: "..."

Early the next morning, the old lady got up, had breakfast, and started sighing again.

The old man remained calm, wearing his reading glasses and looking at something on his tablet.

The old lady sat beside him, uninterested in what he was doing. She looked at the fruit on the coffee table and thought of Isabella again.

She missed her one moment, felt sad the next.

The old man couldn't stand it anymore and handed her the tablet. "Here, pick one you like."

"?"

The old lady took it suspiciously and found pictures of villas and townhouses on the screen.

"This…"

Isaac: "Weren't we planning to buy a place in their city anyway? If our daughter can't come to Kyoto, we can go to her."

"We hadn't found a suitable property, so we held off. A couple of days ago, Assistant Jiang called saying he found a few good options. Told me to look and decide which one to buy…"

"These three are all good. Move-in ready, fully furnished. The decision is yours."

Florence shot him a mock-annoyed look, immediately beaming. "Why didn't you say so earlier? Made me upset for two days… This one is good! This villa is right in Isabella's neighborhood!"

Isaac glanced down. "I knew it…"

"You knew and still asked me?"

He rubbed his nose. "Wasn't I worried living too close to the young ones might cause friction? Really not considering the others? These two are also quite close, just a ten-minute walk."

Florence: "You said it yourself—a ten-minute walk! That's not close? I believe David isn't a difficult person. We'll get along fine! I guarantee no friction!"

"Fine, this one it is! I'll handle the paperwork immediately." The old man finalized the decision.

The old lady, thinking she could soon live in the same neighborhood as her daughter, instantly felt her gloom vanish. She was refreshed and energized.

Just then, a servant came in and said Irene Valdemar was at the gate, asking if she should be let in.

The old couple exchanged a look. "No, tell her to leave."

"But…"

Florence: "What is it?"

"Miss— I mean, Irene Valdemar says… Theodore Valdemar wants a divorce."
###Chapter 445

Whose Son Is Sebastian Really?

After the birthday banquet incident, Irene was forcibly sent back to the Valdemar residence.

Theodore never showed his face.

It was said he had gone abroad to handle urgent business.

Irene tried calling her husband for two consecutive days, but the calls never went through.

In her rage, she smashed two phones.

The servants trembled with fear, not daring to approach.

One week later, early in the morning.

Irene finished her breakfast and prepared to go out.

Theodore's assistant suddenly appeared.

After a brief greeting, he handed her a document.

Puzzled, Irene opened it.

The words "Divorce Agreement" stared back at her.

She froze on the spot.

Time seemed to stand still.

A long time passed before she slowly looked up.

"What is the meaning of this?"

The assistant replied in a strictly professional manner. "Mr. Valdemar instructed me to deliver this to you."

"Tell Theodore to come and speak to me himself! Do you think I will sign this?"

"I will convey your message." The assistant collected the agreement and turned to leave.

Irene finally showed signs of panic.

She immediately contacted Sebastian.

"Your father wants a divorce!"

The response on the other end was eerily calm.

"I know."

"Is that all you have to say?"

"I anticipated this the day of the birthday banquet."

"Come home immediately! Unless you no longer want me as your mother!"

This successfully forced Sebastian to return.

He had just stepped through the door when he saw his mother, her face streaked with tears.

"Mom…"

Irene threw herself into his arms, sobbing.

Sebastian gently patted her back.

"Go find your father! Make him take it back!"

"I can't do that."

"Whose side are you on? A divorce will harm your interests! What if he remarries and has another child? Your inheritance will be at risk!"

"I understand all that. But no one can change Dad's mind once it's made up."

"You've been married to him for decades. You should know that better than I do."

Irene's face turned deathly pale. She swayed unsteadily.

"Am I just being discarded like this?"

She muttered to herself.

"Why divorce so suddenly? Because of Emilia? That woman just won't stay gone!"

Sebastian said, "Before this, Dad never mentioned divorce."

"He even kept it from you?"

"I'm not sure."

After Sebastian left, Irene sat alone in silence.

No…

She couldn't admit defeat…

She had schemed so hard to marry Theodore.

They had weathered decades of storms together. She couldn't be forced out now.

What was the point of all her past efforts?

Irene wiped away her tears, applied her makeup, and went to the Atlante residence.

Since the problem started at the birthday banquet, since Theodore was standing up for Emilia, she would start with the Atlante family.

If Emilia persuaded him not to divorce, would he change his mind?

Reality dealt her a harsh blow.

"Won't see me?" Irene raised her voice. "Did you make my purpose clear?"

The servant nodded.

"Did you mention the divorce?"

The servant nodded again.

"What was their reaction?"

"The Master said he will not see you. The Mistress said your family affairs are none of their concern."

Irene gritted her teeth.

Not only did they refuse to acknowledge her, they wouldn't even lift a finger to help!

"Fine! Since they are heartless, they can't blame me for being ruthless!"

She turned to leave, then suddenly turned back.

"Where is Emilia?"

The servant hesitated.

Irene sneered. "Is it so difficult to answer me now? I treated you well in the past!"

"Miss, I'm sorry…"

"Speak! Where is Emilia?"

"The Second Young Miss left several days ago."

Irene frowned. "Back to the neighboring city? With David Sullivan?"

"I really don't know…"

"Useless!" Irene stormed off in anger.

When she returned home, she saw Theodore standing in the living room.

The man was dressed in a black suit, his posture tall and straight.

Nearly fifty, he was still exceptionally handsome.

She stood in the entryway, momentarily stunned.

She had been captivated by this face in her youth. Thirty years later, she was still deeply enthralled.

"You…"

Theodore looked up coldly. "The assistant said you wanted to talk?"

Irene snapped back to reality. Her eyes instantly welled with tears.

"Honey…"

Theodore remained unmoved. "I'm back. What did you want to discuss?"

"Can we not get a divorce?" she pleaded softly.

The man's expression was unreadable.

"We've been married for over twenty years. Our son is all grown up. You want a divorce just like that? Theodore, you have no heart—"

"Heh. You still have the nerve to ask me? You dare mention our son?"

"At least let me understand why I'm being cast aside!"

"Fine," Theodore sneered, stepping closer. "Who was responsible for Emilia's disappearance back then?"

"How did you get pregnant?"

"Whose son is Sebastian, really?"

Each question hit like a thunderclap.

Not only was Irene shaken to her core, but Sebastian, who had just arrived at the door, heard every word clearly!

His steps faltered.
###Chapter 446

Irene trembled violently.

Her face was deathly pale.

"You can accuse me of harming Emilia."

"You can blame me for scheming to marry you."

"But you cannot question Sebastian's parentage."

"That is an insult to me."

"And a deep wound to our son!"

Theodore's gaze was sharp.

"So, you admit you schemed back then?"

Irene bit her lip.

"Yes."

"I had a friend get you drunk."

"I undressed and lay in your bed."

"I pretended we slept together in a drunken mistake."

You guessed correctly.

Nothing happened that night.

Tears streamed down her face.

Her voice was hoarse.

Theodore's expression was cold.

"So the pregnancy was also fake?"

Irene laughed bitterly.

"If I hadn't said that."

"Would you have married me?"

She remembered that morning.

Theodore's expression when he woke up.

Shock.

Calm.

Interrogation.

Finally, only a warning.

No apology.

No comfort.

Only humiliation.

A month later.

She went to her parents with the pregnancy test.

Isaac and Florence were furious.

But their anger was directed solely at her.

Eventually, they intervened.

Theodore agreed to marry her.

"Do you know why I agreed?" Theodore's smile was icy.

Irene froze.

"Wasn't it because I was pregnant?"

"No." Theodore stepped closer. "The old man and the old lady said being with you meant I had no chance with Emilia anymore."

"I couldn't accept it."

"The rose I had guarded."

"Was almost within my grasp."

"Yet they said it was hopeless."

Irene covered her ears.

"No... I don't want to hear this..."

Theodore gripped her shoulders.

"You will listen!"

"Rather than become strangers with her."

"I chose to marry you."

"At least I could see her openly."

Irene screamed.

"Madman! You're a madman!"

She clawed at his face.

Emilia was already missing by then.

Her fate unknown.

Yet for that slim chance.

He chose to marry her.

It was utterly absurd.

"Hahahahaha..." Irene laughed hysterically. "You're completely insane..."

Theodore avoided her hands.

"Correct, I am insane."

"Now you understand your worth?"

"As for Sebastian..." The man smirked coldly. "You were clever."

"You knew the Evans family heirs deposit sperm in the bank upon adulthood."

"To maintain the lie."

"You went for IVF."

"And actually succeeded."

Irene stiffened.

A chill ran through her.

"You... you knew?!"

Theodore raised an eyebrow.

"Do I look like a fool to you?"

Raise another man's son?

Not a chance!

All direct descendants of the Evans family.

Undergo paternity tests after birth.

He never doubted Sebastian's lineage.

Irene's little tricks.

Were easily uncovered with minimal investigation.

She was smug.

Thinking she had deceived everyone for over twenty years.

Little did she know...

She was the only fool!

Irene looked up, bewildered.

"Why? If you knew... why did you ask me?!"

"Without pressing you with something serious."

"Would you have admitted what you thought was minor?"

What had she just said?

You can accuse me of harming Emilia.

You can blame me for scheming to marry you.

The first two sentences.

Were what he wanted to hear.

Irene felt ice-cold.

"You... set me up?!"

"Was the divorce agreement before also an act?"

Theodore sneered.

"I am very satisfied with Sebastian as the heir."

"The family is also satisfied."

"For the sake of the heir."

"I will not divorce."

Irene breathed a sigh of relief.

"And there will be no other children."

She froze.

Theodore looked around.

"I will not return to this house."

"I will not answer your calls."

"You will receive a fixed monthly allowance."

"All social engagements are forbidden."

"The staff will watch you."

"The driver will follow you."

"To ensure you do not disgrace the title of Mrs. Valdemar."

"If you wish to divorce."

"Notify my assistant in advance."

"I will appear on time."

"Other than that."

"We have no further connection."

"Thank Sebastian."

"Without him."

"There would be no you as you are now."

Finished.

The man turned to leave.

His belongings would be collected later.

Irene rushed after him.

She hugged him from behind.

"Don't... Theo, I beg you..."

"I know I was wrong..."

"I'll apologize to Emilia..."

"I'll beg the old man and the old lady for forgiveness..."

"Don't go..."

"I won't interfere in your affairs..."

"Whether you look for Emilia."

"Or find another woman."

"It's all fine..."

"Don't be so cruel..."

What was the difference between this and exile?

Besides an empty title.

What did she have left?

Not even normal social interaction.

Suddenly.

Irene saw Sebastian at the doorway.

"Son! You're back!"

"Quick, talk to your father..."

"I'm your mother..."

Sebastian spoke calmly.

"Dad."
###Chapter 447

Theodore gave a faint hum of acknowledgment.

Father and son stood together, their features strikingly similar.

He brushed Irene's hand aside and strode out.

Passing Sebastian, he paused briefly, reaching out to pat his son's shoulder.

Irene stared blankly at the scene.

She watched this excessively calm father and son.

A sudden realization dawned, her pupils contracting sharply.

"Sebastian! You knew all along, didn't you?!"

She rushed forward, grabbing his arm, her voice trembling. "You knew the whole time?!"

Sebastian nodded. "Yes."

"Since when?"

"From the very beginning."

"Hahaha..." Irene laughed until tears streamed down her face. "So you both knew... Only I was kept in the dark!"

"My husband! My son! Conspiring to deceive me!"

"Mom, wrongdoing always has consequences. Dad gave you chances."

"You're saying I deserved this?!"

"...If that's how you choose to see it, then yes."

"..."

Theodore went to the Atlante residence himself.

He informed the elderly couple of the decision regarding Irene.

Isaac remained silent for a long time before finally sighing deeply. "...Perhaps it's for the best."

Florence's expression was calm. "From now on, Erika is Erika, and Sebastian is Sebastian. To us, they have no connection whatsoever."

"...Understood." Theodore had anticipated this.

But he still wanted to ask: What about me?

What am I to you?

The words reached his lips, but he swallowed them back.

Florence saw him to the door.

Theodore couldn't help glancing inside.

"Emilia isn't here. Don't look." The old woman's voice was gentle yet distant.

Theodore smiled bitterly and averted his gaze.

A flicker of pity crossed Florence's eyes, quickly replaced by composure. "Theodore, you're a good man, but you and Emilia... this is how it must be. Blame fate for playing its cruel joke."

"Fortunately, she hasn't suffered too much these past twenty years, thanks to David's care."

"After spending time with him, we are very satisfied with David as our son-in-law. You..." The old woman paused.

"...should let go. Deep affection and obsession are two different things. We don't want you trapped in the past, nor do we want... Emilia and David's peaceful life now to be disturbed."

"Do you—understand me?"

This final sentence was the true point.

The favoritism and protectiveness were so evident, even extending to David Sullivan now.

Theodore's smile was bitter. "You have my word."

He might have entertained thoughts, but...

Emilia had endured so much hardship. Finally reunited with her family, how could he bear to disrupt it?

Let it be...

Nighttime. A bar.

Sebastian wasn't surprised to see Theodore there.

He was the one who had recommended this place.

Sebastian sat opposite him. "Care for a drink?"

Theodore smiled, pouring him a drink. "It's been a while since we had a proper talk, son."

Sebastian glanced around at their surroundings. "This doesn't qualify as 'proper'."

"Haha..." Theodore laughed heartily. "Improper it is, then."

Sebastian: "..."

"You spent New Year's Eve with the Atlantes. Sophia was there too, I assume?"

Sebastian frowned. "Of course she was. I posted it. Didn't you see?"

"Don't be so guarded. You're my son. You think I can't see right through you?"

Sebastian's expression shifted slightly.

He seemed surprised his father had seen through him so easily.

"Tell me, why can't we father and son seem to get past those mother and daughter?"

Sebastian: "..."

"Is it in our genes? If so, that's just..." Theodore swirled his glass, letting out a short, bitter laugh. "...fucked up."

"Isn't it?" Sebastian's lips curved in self-mockery.

"Done pretending?"

Sebastian: "..."

Theodore offered advice, speaking from experience. "As someone who's been there, let me tell you: cut your losses early. Don't wait until you're in too deep and destroy yourself."

"Your experience can stay with you. It's not exactly a success story."

"..." Theodore was rendered speechless.

Neither father nor son was drunk as they left the bar one after the other.

"Really not coming home?" Sebastian asked.

"No."

"...Fine. When you have time, have your assistant send a message to Mom. Don't let things get too strained. It looks bad."

Theodore raised an eyebrow. "Bad for whom?"

"For me. For you. For the Valdemar Group. For everyone."

"Not doing it." Theodore turned away, raising his cigarette in a slight wave. "I'm off."

Sebastian sighed.

He had tried. Let it be.

...

Sophia Sullivan was completely unaware of the turmoil between the Valdemar and Atlante families.

She had long returned to campus and immersed herself in her studies.

Her life was a strict routine between classroom and laboratory, leaving her constantly busy.

The Transcendence Lab had another paper published in a Nature sub-journal, Nature Biotechnology.

It was like a massive rock thrown into still water, creating towering waves.

The faculty and university administration were utterly stunned.

Dean's Office—

"Nature sub-journal? Didn't they publish one last semester?"

"This is a new one!"

"...What?" The Dean's teacup trembled violently in his hand.

The Vice Dean took a deep breath. "Sophia Sullivan's team has published another paper in a Nature sub-journal. The quality and efficiency are on par with established research teams..."

Moreover, they only had three people!

Even with the newly added Caleb, it was only four!

The Dean's hand shook, spilling hot tea across his desk.

Clutching at a final shred of hope, he asked, "Which sub-journal?"

There were many Nature sub-journals, with varying standards.

The Vice Dean replied, "Nature Biotechnology again."

Crash—

The teacup fell to the floor.

That last sliver of hope was utterly shattered.

...

President's Office—

Xiao Ninghan was silent for a full three minutes before slowly looking up, murmuring in a daze, "Nature Biotechnology... again..."

The Vice President opened his mouth, struggling to find his voice for a moment. "...Their field is a perfect match. It gives them an advantage for acceptance..."

He trailed off, unable to continue the weak justification himself.

There were so many students in the same field across the country. Not every one of them got accepted, did they?

It wasn't entirely without reason.

Nature Biotechnology focused heavily on computational biology, with a particular preference for algorithms and modeling.

Sophia Sullivan's team's research direction hit the bullseye perfectly.

Right now, it also felt like it was hitting Xiao Ninghan right between the eyes.
###Chapter 448

The administration of the School and the Institute could no longer remain seated.

The latest JCR global journal impact factor rankings were out.
Nature was ranked tenth.
Its impact factor was substantial.
But Nature Biotechnology had surged to eighth place.
Its impact factor was even higher.
In terms of impact factor alone, the subsidiary journal Nature Biotechnology now held more weight than the main journal.
Sophia Sullivan's team had published two papers in it within a single year.
What kind of pace was that?
The academic world was shaken.
"These kids... truly unexpected," Professor Benjamin Murphy sighed softly. "Originally, these achievements should have belonged to the school. What a pity..."
His words trailed off.
When he first heard that Sophia and the other two had built their own lab, he thought it was absurd.
Later, when the lab was completed, its facilities far exceeded the school's standards, and it had attracted many academic luminaries.
That was when he realized he had misjudged them.
Sophia Sullivan was no ordinary student.
Fortunately, they were his students. Their strength was good for the school.
But Professor Eleanor Watson had publicly declared she was relinquishing her authorship rights.
All achievements would belong to the Boundaryless Lab.
It was a silent, stinging slap to the school's face.
Without authorship, the school had no claim to these accomplishments.
Professor Murphy's expression darkened immediately.
He quickly composed himself. He was, after all, the head of the institute. He couldn't lose his composure.
Afterwards, however, he severely reprimanded the Vice President and the Dean of the School of Life Sciences.
As for Professor Victoria Lowell...
She wasn't important enough for him to deal with personally.
The Dean of the School of Life Sciences knew exactly what to do.
Those in power never dirty their own hands with ants.
But they have plenty of ways to make the ants miserable.
A simple "it was done by subordinates" could absolve them of all blame.
After his outburst, Professor Murphy calmed down.
Since Professor Watson had publicly cut the school out, he would see what results Sophia's team could actually produce.
If they wanted the school to regret it, they needed to have the capability.
For the next few months, the Boundaryless Lab was silent.
Sophia and the other two attended their classes as usual.
It seemed the matter had blown over.
Turns out it hadn't blown over. It was waiting for him right here.
Professor Murphy's straight spine seemed to bend slightly.
A air of dejection settled over him.
After a long while, he looked up and sighed. "I misjudged them... Never underestimate the youth from humble beginnings."
The Vice President tentatively asked, "Should we do something?"
Professor Murphy waved his hand. "No need. We didn't offer help when they were in need. Why add flowers to the brocade now?"
He could lose face, but he couldn't lose his principles.
"But... but..." The Vice President clenched his fist, every movement screaming with frustration. "It's Nature Biotechnology! Two papers! Who knows how many more in the future..."
"Benjamin, I understand you have your pride. The school has its dignity. We can't bow to students..."
This precedent could not be set.
"But the International Academic Exchange is about to begin. Why not have Sophia's team represent the school in the biology unit competition..."
Professor Murphy cut him off. "I admit Sophia's team has ability. But publishing papers and academic competition are two different things. This year's team is already set. They are training intensely. Changing players at the last minute is unwise."
The Vice President insisted urgently, "But we've lost to foreign universities for five years straight! If we lose again this year, it's not just an internal competition. It's an international showdown! Losing to our own isn't shameful, but losing to foreigners..."
On a small scale, it was a lack of skill.
On a larger scale, it concerned national honor and pride.
"Benjamin, we really can't afford to lose this year—"
Professor Murphy frowned deeply. "How can you be sure Sophia's team will win if they compete?"
"...I'm not sure. But it's a chance to win with an unexpected move!"

...

Boundaryless Lab break area.
"Achoo! Achoo! Achoo!"
Hannah Morse sneezed three times in a row.
She rubbed her nose and muttered, "Someone must be talking behind my back..."
Marcus Lawrence glanced at her. "Unlikely—Achoo!"
"See!" Hannah pointed at him. "You too!"
Marcus tossed his tissue into the trash. "I have a cold. If someone really is talking, why hasn't Sophia—"
"Achoo!" Sophia looked slightly embarrassed under their gazes. "I'm not sick..."
Marcus Lawrence: "..." Okay then.
Hannah immediately beamed. "Hehe, I'm such a clever little thing~"
Her happiness was always simple.
The corner of Marcus's mouth twitched upward. "The good news about Nature Biotechnology broke right after the semester started. Probably the whole institute knows by now. It's normal for people to talk."
Hannah: "Wrong! The whole school knows!"
"How do you know?"
Hannah took out her phone, opened a social media app, and shoved it in Marcus's face. "A teacher from the academic affairs office posted it. As soon as the acceptance notice came, the school posted it on their official account and blog. They even put up a red announcement on the bulletin board."
"With that kind of fanfare, it's impossible not to know!"
Marcus looked thoughtful.
Hannah turned to Sophia, who also seemed pensive.
"W-what's wrong?" Hannah blinked. "The school sent congratulations. Isn't that good?"
Marcus: "It's not bad. It's just strange."
"Where's the strange part?"
"The corresponding author on the paper is Sophia. The achievements belong to the lab, not the school."
If they don't belong to the school, why the big celebration?
Sophia nodded. "I thought the school would pretend not to know. Achievements under an off-campus lab are embarrassing for the school. Playing dumb was the best option."
The school's reaction was completely unexpected.
Sophia: "Abnormal events either mean there's a ghost, or they want something."
Marcus Lawrence's expression darkened instantly.
###Chapter 449
"Hey, don't overthink it!" Hannah Morse waved her hand dismissively. "If the school has arrangements, they'll definitely notify us."

We'll know when the time comes.

Why speculate blindly now?

Sophia Sullivan nodded. "That makes sense. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it."

"Exactly! We just published another paper in Nature Biotechnology. Shouldn't we be celebrating?"

"We should."

Hannah looked at Marcus.

He gave a slight nod.

"Perfect! Let's go into the city for a fancy dinner today! There's a new Thai place on Newbury Street. The reviews are amazing. I've been dying to try it!"

Hannah's food radar was activated again.

The lab was located in the suburbs. Going downtown was considered "going into the city" for her.

Marcus raised an eyebrow. "Just dinner to celebrate?"

Hannah blinked. "French cuisine works too."

"..."

"Or Japanese? Cantonese? I'm easy!"

"..."

In the end, the three of them went to that Thai restaurant.

Dinner ended at eight PM.

The night was deep, and the city lights had just begun to glow.

"Has Senior Caleb been to the lab recently?" Hannah suddenly remembered something.

Marcus pondered. "Haven't seen him since the semester started. What about you, Sophia?"

Sophia shook her head. "I haven't run into him either."

"That's strange..." Hannah frowned. "Third-year grad students have few classes. He's a workaholic. There's no reason for him not to come."

Before the Spring Festival, Caleb had mentioned rushing data for two models, planning to submit papers right after the semester began.

Sophia guessed, "Maybe he hasn't returned to campus yet?"

MIT had lax management for graduating students. It was acceptable to arrive on campus a few days after completing online registration.

Hannah nodded. "If he were back, he'd definitely be in the lab."

Sophia added, "I called him a few days ago, but no one answered. Later, his phone was turned off completely. I'll go ask at the department tomorrow."

...

The next day, Sophia inquired with other third-year grad students and confirmed they had very few classes.

Caleb indeed had not returned to campus.

She returned to the lab. Just as she put on her lab coat, Hannah rushed in breathlessly—

"Sophia! Something's wrong!"

Sophia looked up. "What is it?"

"I went to find Jude Granger to ask about Senior Caleb. Turns out, he hasn't returned to campus either! I felt something was off, so I quickly asked other third-year students. Senior Caleb really isn't back!"

"You taught me that too many coincidences are not coincidences."

Sophia's brow furrowed tightly. "So both Caleb and Jude haven't returned?"

"Yes!"

"Senior Caleb returning late is somewhat normal. But Jude, that model student, would never dare to do something like this."

First-year grad students were under strict scrutiny.

Violating rules could lead to expulsion.

Jude had worked hard to transfer under Professor Watson's guidance. He cherished the opportunity immensely. Professor Watson had even created a customized training plan for him...

He wouldn't take such a risk.

Hannah said, "So the more I thought about it, the more wrong it felt."

Sophia's expression turned grave. "There is definitely a problem."

"A third-year senior said Senior Caleb's parents are in poor health. Could something at home have delayed him?"

Marcus stated calmly, "His parents have always been in poor health. It never delayed him before. It's unlikely now, unless there's an emergency."

"An emergency?"

"Like a sudden worsening of their condition requiring care, or something happening at home that he can't leave."

Sophia asked, "If it's just something with Caleb's family, how do we explain Jude not returning either?"

"This..."

Sophia concluded, "Guessing is useless. We need to contact Caleb first."

Over the next few days, the three tried every method to reach Caleb.

Phone calls, emails, messages on social platforms...

All attempts vanished without a trace.

"What do we do now?"

Two weeks into the semester, Sophia explained the situation to Professor Eleanor Watson. Professor Watson communicated with the school administration, temporarily postponing action against the two students.

But the school wouldn't wait indefinitely.

Professor Watson said, "One week extension at most."

"Two weeks have already passed. We only have seven days left." Hannah paced anxiously. "What if they can't make it back... Will the school really expel them?"

No one could guarantee otherwise.

"Are we just supposed to wait? There's nothing we can do?"

Marcus said, "We've done all we can. Now we can only wait for news."

"But... Sophia, what do you think?"

Sophia thought for a moment. "Let's try to find Caleb's home address."

"Address?" Hannah was stunned. "You want to go to his hometown?"

"It's the only way to find out what's happening."

Hannah declared, "I'm coming too!"

Marcus added, "It's not safe for two girls alone. Count me in."

"You?" Hannah looked him over. "Can you fight?"

Marcus: "..." This isn't about fighting.

"...Is violence necessary?"

The three immediately split up to take action.

Sophia asked Professor Watson for Caleb's basic information.

Hannah contacted senior students familiar with Caleb to inquire about his address.

Marcus checked Caleb's student records through the registrar's office.

After a busy afternoon, they reconvened.

Sophia spoke first. "The address Caleb provided is incomplete. It only lists Qijiang District, Chongqing Municipality."

Hannah nodded. "That's what I found out too!"

They both looked at Marcus.

Hannah asked impatiently, "Did you find the full address?"

Marcus nodded slowly. "I did."

Their eyes lit up.

Marcus said solemnly, "Datong Town, Qijiang District, Chongqing Municipality."
###Chapter 450

The winter in the southern Chongqing region was damp and cold.

A light drizzle was falling as the high-speed train arrived.

Sophia Sullivan and her two companions had just stepped off the train when a cold wind blew into their collars.

The chill seeped into their bones.

Hannah Morse wrapped her scarf tighter, tucked her chin in, and shoved her hands into her pockets, looking like a plump little quail.

"Sophia, let's hurry. This platform is so drafty."

Her breath formed white puffs in the air.

Sophia nodded. "Let's get out of the station first."

The small county station was spacious and quiet.

There were no crowds, only a few scattered travelers.

"I asked. The bus to town runs every fifty minutes. The last one just left."

Marcus Lawrence stated calmly, "If we want to get to town today, our only options are a private minivan or hiring a car."

Sophia asked, "What's a hired car?"

"Private cars that take passengers," Marcus added. "Also privately operated."

Sophia glanced at the sky. "It's getting dark. Should we stay in the county tonight and leave tomorrow morning?"

Hannah nodded vigorously. "Agreed! It's safer during the day."

Marcus said, "I have no objections."

It was already eight PM by the time the three checked into a small hotel.

The streets were silent, the night heavy.

Hannah pushed open the window. Only a few grocery stores and barbecue stalls had their lights on.

"Sophia... it's so quiet here... it's a bit scary..."

She rubbed her arms.

Sophia handed her a prepared cup of instant noodles. "This is all we have."

They had originally planned to go downstairs for barbecue.

But seeing the vendor wipe raw meat with the same rag used for the grill instantly killed their appetite.

Hannah sniffed. "It smells so good~"

Sophia chuckled. "That's not like you."

"What do you mean?"

"You're so picky about food. You actually think instant noodles smell good?"

"Hehe, I'm just hungry~"

She began eating hungrily.

A sudden knock sounded at the door.

Hannah paused. "Who is it?"

"It's me."

Marcus's voice.

Sophia opened the door. Marcus stood there, eating noodles with a plastic fork.

He asked, "Did you guys find the heater switch?"

Sophia: "?"

Hannah: "?"

Two confused faces.

Marcus stopped chewing. "Is... there a problem?"

Hannah said, exasperated, "Dude, this is the south. There's no central heating."

Marcus was stunned. "It's this cold... and no heating?"

Hannah smiled sweetly. "That's right~"

This shabby little hotel didn't even have working air conditioning.

So pathetic.

She had never stayed in such a terrible place.

That night, the three finished their instant noodles and went to bed early.

The next morning, they boarded the first bus, the 516.

But...

The bus was packed!

Mostly with elderly people.

Baskets and carrying poles were piled everywhere, filled with fresh vegetables and local produce.

Hannah was dumbfounded. "Why are there so many people?"

The three were immediately pushed into the middle of the bus.

Baskets were at their feet, standing elderly people pressed close beside them.

So close they could smell what the others had for breakfast.

"Sophia, I'm scared..."

Tears welled in Hannah's eyes as she looked for Sophia.

But her gaze met Marcus's instead.

Sophia had been pushed further back.

Their eyes met. One was about to cry, the other was stunned.

"You..."

"Marcus, I'm scared..."

A corner of Marcus's heart softened.

"Come closer, over here..." He tried to make some space.

Hannah immediately moved closer.

"Why are all these people crowding the bus so early?"

"Probably for the market."

The vegetables in the baskets were meant for selling.

Most were likely from rural areas.

Suddenly, someone shoved Hannah from behind, sending her stumbling forward.

Marcus's expression changed. He caught her against his chest.

Preventing her head from hitting a seat.

"Are you okay?" He helped her up, checking on her anxiously.

Hannah's face flushed red. "Marcus... I can't breathe..."

Marcus immediately pulled open a window.

Cold air rushed in.

"What are you doing? It's freezing! Why open the window?"

"Exactly! The wind is giving me a headache!"

"Close it! Close it now!"

Marcus's voice turned low and firm. "My friend is having trouble breathing. She needs the window open. Please understand."

"Trouble breathing... she's just making a fuss..."

"If you're fat, don't squeeze onto the bus. You take up space and make demands..."

"Exactly! We're a bus full of elderly people. If we catch a cold, will you pay for it?"

The chorus of complaints made Hannah bow her head in shame.

Marcus patted her lightly, signaling her not to be afraid.

He said loudly—

"Your comfort is your business. My friend needs the window open. Is there a problem? Not everyone is as unreasonable as you!"

"Who says overweight people can't ride the bus? We bought tickets. Your baskets and poles are taking up space. Did you buy tickets for them?"

No one spoke.

The driver glanced at Marcus in the rearview mirror.

Someone muttered under their breath, "Young people these days are so mouthy..."

Marcus remained expressionless.

With fresh air, Hannah gradually recovered.

She looked at Marcus with admiration—

"Oh my god! Marcus, you were so cool just now!"

Marcus's ears, which hadn't reddened during the argument, now turned bright red.

He felt a little embarrassed.
###Chapter 451

The bus jolted along the mountain switchbacks.

They finally arrived in the small town.

The three of them got off and let out a long sigh of relief.

That last stretch of road had been a nightmare.

Hannah Morse bought a drink and gulped it down. "Are we here?"

Sophia Sullivan shook her head. "This is the town. Caleb's family is in the village. We still have a ways to go."

"More driving?!" Hannah's face paled.

Marcus Lawrence spoke up. "There's no bus to the village."

Hannah just started to relax.

He continued. "We can only take an auto rickshaw."

"?"

Ten minutes later, Hannah was jolted off her seat for the third time.

On a sharp turn, she nearly flew out.

"...This is what you call 'a little bumpy'?"

Marcus gripped the handrail tightly, his face ashen. "The GPS says it's not far. Just hang on a little longer."

He hadn't expected the road to be this bad. It was all primitive dirt track.

Hannah noticed his expression. "What's wrong? Are you okay?"

Marcus gritted his teeth. "I'm fine."

Sophia frowned. "Carsick?"

The moment she said it, Marcus lunged for the window.

He vomited with a loud "Whoa!"

Sophia: "..."

Hannah Morse: "..."

Marcus wiped his mouth and pulled his head back in. "I'm really fine!"

Sophia and Hannah: "..." Yeah, right.

Hannah fished a dried plum from her bag and shoved it at him. "It's sour. It'll help."

Marcus tried to refuse.

Hannah forced it into his hand.

"Just eat it. Don't be stubborn."

"I..."

Hannah: "I know, you're fine. No need to keep saying it."

Marcus: "...Thanks."

Hannah turned and winked at Sophia: Too proud for his own good!

Sophia: Is it okay to trash-talk him like that?

Hannah: I'm totally trash-talking him!

Marcus: "..." I'm not blind.

The driver was around fifty, with dark skin and a bright white smile. "You're from out of town, right? The road to Lower Dam Village is terrible. If I wasn't heading that way myself today, no one would dare take you on this stretch!"

"A special trip would cost extra."

Sophia's eyes flickered. "Are you from Lower Dam Village, uncle?"

"Yep. Just heading home and making a bit for gas."

"Are there any families named Watson in the village?"

"Several families named Watson. Which one are you looking for?"

Sophia: "Their son is a top student at MIT..."

"Oh! Walter Watson's place? You're really looking for him?" The driver paused. "Strangers never come to their house."

Sophia: "We're looking for his son."

"Caleb?"

"Yes, do you know him?"

"The first from the village to get into university. I remember him a bit."

Hannah: "We're Caleb's classmates. Can you take us there?"

The driver gave them a strange look for a second, then nodded. "Alright. I'll drop you right at the door since it's on my way."

"Thank you!"

Marcus suddenly spoke. "Why do you call him Walter Watson?"

"His leg is lame. He walks with a limp."

From the conversation, they learned the Watson family was very poor.

His mother had a chronic illness and needed medicine year-round.

His father was the only breadwinner. He'd been injured on a construction site years ago, crippling his leg, and had returned to farm.

His fruit orchard harvests were hit or miss.

But the medical expenses for the sick were relentless, and his son was studying far away in Cambridge and couldn't help.

The three fell silent.

They only knew Caleb was being exploited by Professor Victoria Lowell. They hadn't known his family was this hard up.

The auto rickshaw stopped.

"We're here. The Watson place is right ahead. You can go on by yourselves."

"Okay, thank you." Sophia scanned the code to pay.

Before them stood a dilapidated, old-fashioned farmhouse.

The trio's moods were complex.

On the way, they'd passed other villages full of multi-story, self-built houses, some even like villas.

There were also small Western-style buildings at the entrance to Lower Dam Village.

But the Watson family...

Hannah had only seen houses like this in period dramas.

The cheapest rental building her family owned was better than this.

Sophia stepped forward and knocked.

No answer.

Hannah knocked again.

There was a faint rustling sound inside.

A hoarse voice called out, "Who is it? Sweetie, go see..."

"Okay!"

The sound of a door bolt being drawn.

The door opened a crack.

A little girl in a faded cotton coat stood there. She wasn't very tall, but her eyes were bright, and her features resembled Caleb's.

She was wary and didn't open the door fully. "Who are you looking for?"

Sophia explained gently, "Hello, we're Caleb's classmates from MIT. We're here to see him. Is he home?"

The little girl turned her head and called inside, "Brother! Your classmates are here!"

From the inner room came the sound of a bowl shattering.
###Chapter 452

Jude Granger… Not Doing Well

Rapid footsteps sounded from inside the house.

The door slammed shut with a bang.

Hannah Morse clicked her tongue lightly. "That kid is really guarded."

Marcus Lawrence frowned slightly.

When they entered the village, many villagers had stood at their doors watching them.

Their gazes turned particularly odd when they saw them heading towards the Watson house.

They huddled in small groups, whispering amongst themselves.

The distance was too great to make out their words.

But their expressions were full of suspicion and scrutiny.

The door opened again.

This time, it was Caleb.

He had heard his sister call out that classmates were here.

His first thought was Sophia Sullivan and the others.

He was so startled he dropped and broke a bowl.

Opening the door, he found it was indeed them.

"What are you all doing here?" Surprise flashed in his eyes.

It quickly turned to astonishment and worry.

The journey from the city to this village was long and arduous.

He knew exactly how difficult it was.

He didn't approve of them coming.

Because he felt he wasn't worth the trouble.

"Are you okay?" Sophia Sullivan looked him over.

All limbs present, spirit seemed alright.

But he only wore a thin cotton jacket in the bitter cold.

His hands were red and raw from the chill.

Not even a scarf around his neck.

Hannah Morse's eyes widened. "Aren't you cold?"

Caleb scratched his head. "Used to it."

He finally remembered to invite them inside.

The three of them entered the main room.

Caleb turned on the light.

So it had been dark before.

Sophia Sullivan glanced around.

An old rural tiled house.

One main room, three bedrooms.

The backyard connected to a kitchen.

Upstairs was a wooden loft for storing odds and ends.

"School started two weeks ago. Why haven't you returned?"

Sophia Sullivan's tone was serious. "Your phone is off. We thought something had happened to you."

Prolonged absence could lead to expulsion.

He was gambling with his future.

He should have at least called the school to explain.

"And Jude Granger. He hasn't returned either. Can't reach him. What's going on with you two?"

Caleb offered a bitter smile and was about to explain.

The little girl who opened the door earlier rushed out.

She spread her arms protectively in front of Caleb.

"Don't blame my brother! He has no choice!"

The girl was just over ten years old, but spoke clearly.

"Chloe Sullivan, they're my friends."

Caleb patted her head.

The girl then stepped aside, lowering her head to pick at her fingers.

"Sorry, I can't leave home. My phone broke."

Caleb's smile was strained.

"Don't your parents have phones? Is it hard to borrow theirs?" Hannah Morse asked bluntly.

It sounded harsh, but it was a fair point.

Caleb scratched his head awkwardly. "I... I don't remember your numbers…"

"What about Jude? His phone broke too?"

At the mention of Jude, Caleb's eyes dimmed.

"He's in the hospital. In a coma. Can't use a phone…"

"A coma?!" All three were shocked.

Sophia Sullivan: "What happened to him?"

"It involves both our families. It's…"

A cough came from one of the bedrooms.

Caleb suddenly remembered something. He turned and rushed into the kitchen.

"Please, sit. Chloe Sullivan, get some water."

Chloe Sullivan Watson brought three earthenware bowls and poured hot water.

Hannah Morse quickly waved her hands. "No need, really!"

Chloe Sullivan still poured a bowl for each of them.

Sophia Sullivan thanked her softly.

"Don't mention it. You're my brother's friends."

Chloe Sullivan pointed to a sofa in the corner. "Sit. I'll go check…"

She headed towards the kitchen.

Sophia Sullivan had noticed the smell of herbal medicine the moment she entered.

An earthenware pot sizzled over the fire.

Caleb used a cloth to hold the hot handle and poured out the medicine.

The scalding liquid was divided into three bowls.

This was his mother's medicine for the day.

Brewed together to save firewood, taken in three doses.

Caleb cleaned the pot of dregs.

He picked up one bowl of medicine and carried it through the main room into a bedroom.

"Mom—the medicine is ready. Time to drink it."

"Okay."

Hannah Morse couldn't help but follow to the doorway.

A frail, elderly woman lay on the bed.

Her hair was streaked with white, buried under a faded, thick quilt.

The air was thick with the bitter scent of herbs.

But it couldn't mask the stale, deathly stillness of the room.

Caleb carefully fed her the medicine.

He tended to her, wiping her mouth and hands.

He helped her lie back down and tucked the quilt tightly around her.

Only after finishing all this did he leave the room, closing the door behind him.

He turned to face the three in the main room.

And his sister, who was watching him anxiously.

In that moment, he felt a profound sense of helplessness.

He had so much to say, but didn't know where to begin.

Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence had never witnessed a scene like this.

They were both shocked and somber.

They tried to control their expressions, staying silent.

"I want to go back to school. But my mother's health is poor. I'll have to delay a while longer. I'll call the academic affairs office to explain. Please don't worry."

Sophia Sullivan felt there was more to the story.

"What about Jude? What really happened to him?"

"Jude, he…" Caleb paused, pain flickering across his face. "He got caught up in my family's troubles."

Caught up?

Caleb took a deep breath and began to explain slowly.
###Chapter 453

Caleb's mother had never been in the best of health.

But she had never been this bad, to the point where eating and drinking were difficult.

What happened around the Spring Festival broke her completely.

The Watson family used to make a living by farming.

Five years ago, Mr. Watson was injured on a construction site.
He was left disabled and could no longer do heavy labor.

He had to stay in the village, tending to their few meager acres.
Later, he cleared the woodlot on the back hill and planted fruit trees.

The first two years were just small-scale trial planting.
He slowly gained experience and expanded the planting area year by year.

The year before last, the weather was favorable.
The fruit trees had a bumper harvest.
They also caught a good market and made a decent profit.

The villagers began to grow envious.
The Watsons had always kept to themselves and didn't interact much with the villagers.
This only fueled more jealousy and resentment.

Last year, the weather was terrible.
The harvest was halved.
The quality of the fruit was poor too.
Continuous heavy rains waterlogged the roots, causing severe losses.

Fortunately, Caleb worked as a ghostwriter for Ashley and got some money from Professor Victoria Lowell.
That eased the family's immediate crisis.

After that, he took a part-time job at an off-campus lab.
His income became stable.
He paid back Professor Lowell the principal with interest.
He even gave the family some leftover money for Mr. Watson to buy high-quality saplings.

The cherry trees planted last year bore fruit this year, as expected.
Mr. Watson tended to them carefully.
The cherries were big and sweet.

This year, cherry orchards in the province were hit by pests.
Cherry prices soared nationwide.
Mr. Watson signed a purchase contract with an out-of-town distributor.

The buyer agreed to take the entire harvest this year.
They even pre-ordered next year's output.

Mr. Watson was overjoyed.
On New Year's Eve, the family reunion was full of hope.
They all felt life was finally getting better.

Who could have guessed things would go wrong the very next day...

Chloe Sullivan spoke up.
"Brother, rest a bit. Let me tell them!"

The Croix family at the village entrance ran a driving school in town.
Business was booming, and they were raking in money.

The Croix family returned to the village and enclosed the best plot of land.
They built a villa.
Since then, everything went smoothly for them, and money kept rolling in.

The Croix family had two sons, Connor and Sebastian.
The two ran amok in the village, bullying men and women alike.
The Croix family never disciplined them, letting them do as they pleased.

If someone came to complain, Vincent Croix would just say, "My sons are grown, I can't control them," and send them away.
If the situation got really bad, he'd pay some compensation.
The Croix family wasn't short on money.

Over time, the villagers learned to avoid the Croix brothers.
They endured what they could and yielded when they had to.
As long as they were still breathing, they gritted their teeth and swallowed their pride.

"Connor and Sebastian took a fancy to our woodlot."
"They said they wanted to move their family graves there."
"They even hired a feng shui master who spent two days surveying it."
"He insisted the land was perfectly suited to their family's destiny."

"They only offered 50 bucks per square meter..."
"Of course Dad refused. So they started finding ways..."

Chloe Sullivan's voice choked up.

The Croix brothers first came with gifts to negotiate the price.
Mr. Watson firmly refused.

The woodlot was planted with fruit trees.
It was the family's only hope.
No amount of money would make him sell.
The Croix's offer was downright insulting.

The two brothers immediately turned hostile.
They overturned the table and smashed things.

Caleb wanted to call the police.
Mr. Watson stopped him.
He said they should just endure it and it would pass.

But their endurance only invited further escalation.

The Croix brothers stole and killed their chickens and dogs in the middle of the night.
They paid people to throw feces at the Watson's walls.

On Lantern Festival, they stormed into the Watson home with their men.
They injured Mr. and Mrs. Watson.

Mrs. Watson's condition worsened.
She still couldn't eat or drink.
They couldn't even take her to the county hospital for treatment.

The Croix family put out the word.
No one in the village with a car was allowed to give the Watsons a ride.

Caleb's phone was deliberately stomped and broken during the conflict.

Jude was also at the Watson home that day.
He was pushed and hit his head.
He bled profusely.

Connor twisted Caleb's arms behind his back.
He pinned him to the ground, unable to move.

Jude's parents rushed over upon hearing the news.
They begged and pleaded desperately.
Only then were they allowed to take their son away.

Jude was sent to the town hospital that night.
When they couldn't treat him, he was transferred to the county hospital.
He remains unconscious to this day.

Chloe Sullivan continued.
"...They never wanted to move graves in the first place!"
"They just saw our cherry orchard was profitable and wanted to seize it!"

Hannah trembled with rage.
"How despicable! How is this any different from outright robbery?"
She looked at Caleb.
"Forget not calling the police the first time. Why didn't you call them after Jude was so badly hurt?"

Caleb gave a bitter smile.
"My brother did call the police! It was useless even when they came..."

A sudden knock sounded at the door.

Caleb walked over and called out, "Dad?"

The door opened.
A hunched, limping middle-aged man entered.
He froze upon seeing Sophia and the others.

Caleb quickly introduced them.
"These are my classmates from MIT. Also good friends."
"They came to see me because I haven't returned to school."

Mr. Watson's expression turned serious.
He tried his best to straighten his back.
"Hello. Thank you for caring about Caleb!"

"We have freshly picked cherries. Let me wash a basket for you. They're very sweet! No pesticides..."

He started heading toward the kitchen.

Sophia quickly waved her hands.
"Uncle, please don't trouble yourself. We just came to see Caleb."

"Beijing is so far away. You must be tired from the trip! Please sit, it'll be ready soon!"

Ignoring their protests, he disappeared into the kitchen.

He soon returned with a basin of bright red cherries, glistening with water droplets.
He turned on all the lights.

"This is brighter!"

He busied himself, anxious not to neglect his son's friends.

Looking at this simple, honest middle-aged uncle, the bruises still visible on his face, yet offering them the best he had...

Hannah's eyes reddened.

Sophia fell silent.

Marcus felt a suffocating heaviness.

All three came from well-off families.
What they saw and heard today completely shattered their perceptions.

So this was the dark, ugly corner where sunlight never reached!

A commotion suddenly erupted outside.

A slovenly voice rang out.
"Hey, Watson! I heard you have guests! Why didn't you call me? Let me have a look too!"

Mr. Watson's body went rigid.

Caleb's face paled dramatically.

Chloe Sullivan hid behind her father in fear, silently crying.

The family was like startled birds.

Who the newcomer was, went without saying.

Sophia narrowed her eyes, looking toward the door.
###Chapter 454

The blond-haired youth kicked the courtyard gate open, a baseball bat in his hand.

He spat toward the house, his face twisted with malice.

"Everyone dead in there? Don't you understand human speech? Get the hell out here—"

Hannah's temper flared instantly. She grabbed her phone and charged outside.

Sophia and Marcus couldn't stop her in time, quickly following behind.

"What do you think you're doing?" Hannah blocked the doorway, glaring at them.

Connor Croix sneered. "Where did this fat sow come from? Mind your own business."

The words "fat sow" ignited Hannah's fury.

"You're as skinny as a scarecrow! Anyone would think you're on something!"

Connor's face darkened immediately.

The white-haired man beside him jumped forward. "You bitch! Looking for a beating?"

Though Hannah didn't understand the dialect, his expression said it all.

The blond and the white-haired man looked alike, both gaunt and hollow-cheeked.

Dark circles under their eyes, purplish lips.

Cloudy irises, high cheekbones.

They looked like addicts.

"Where's the cripple? Sign the damn contract now!"

The blond sneered, shaking the bat in his hand.

"Or don't blame us for what happens next!"

"You think you can just take it by force?" Hannah stood her ground.

The blond turned to the white-haired man with a grin. "This fat sow won't cry until she sees the coffin."

The white-haired man raised his bat. "Let me teach her a lesson—"

"Don't you dare!" Hannah straightened her back. "I'll call the police if you lay a hand on me!"

"The police?" The blond laughed as if he'd heard the funniest joke. "Go ahead! See what they can do to us!"

Seeing their confidence, Hannah's heart sank.

She quickly turned on her phone's camera. "If the law can't deal with you, the internet will!"

The blond and white-haired man's expressions changed simultaneously.

One lunged for her phone, the other grabbed her arm.

Marcus swiftly pulled Hannah back.

Sophia snatched a broom leaning against the wall and swung it.

The three retreated, creating distance.

Only then did Connor and his brother Sebastian notice the other two.

Marcus demanded coldly, "Attempting robbery in broad daylight?"

Connor grinned. "This village belongs to the Croix family! Got it?"

"Oh?" Sophia raised an eyebrow. "A village can be privately owned?"

"Clueless! We'll teach you today! Sebastian, get them!"

Connor waved his hand. Sebastian charged forward with his bat.

Marcus shielded the two girls, unable to dodge in time.

At the critical moment, Caleb rushed out from the house holding a shovel, blocking the descending bat with a loud clang.

Sebastian froze, then grinned viciously. "Caleb? Got some nerve now?"

Caleb stood protectively in front of the three, gripping the shovel tightly, his knuckles white. "Connor! Sebastian! You hurt my parents, put Jude in the hospital, and now you're coming after my friends?!"

"Oho, friends? From the city? No wonder you're so bold…"

Connor narrowed his eyes. "Sebastian, stop talking. Let's take care of them all!"

"Alright!"

Mr. Watson limped out from the inner room, a kitchen knife in his hand.

"Leave the kids alone! Or I'll fight you to the death!" His eyes were bloodshot, veins bulging, looking half-mad.

A gentle man driven to wield a knife is more terrifying than a hardened criminal.

The Croix brothers were momentarily cowed.

Exchanging a glance, they saw caution in each other's eyes.

Connor gritted his teeth. "We'll let you off today! Bring the contract tomorrow! You'll sign it whether you want to or not!"

He grabbed Sebastian and left quickly.

That cripple has truly lost his mind!

After they left—

Clang!

Clang!

The kitchen knife and shovel fell to the ground.

Mr. Watson's legs gave way. Caleb hurried to support him.

Marcus stood nearby, seeing Caleb drenched in sweat, his collar soaked.

…

That night, the three stayed at the Watson's home.

Mr. Watson prepared a meal and invited them to eat.

Two meat dishes, two vegetable dishes, a soup, and plenty of rice.

"Don't be shy, eat your fill!"

"Thank you, Uncle."

Hannah was starving and had two bowls.

Marcus also had seconds.

Sophia noticed Mr. Watson and Caleb rarely touched the meat dishes.

Before they finished eating, Mr. Watson had quickly finished his rice and went to feed his wife and give her medicine.

After Mrs. Watson finished eating, she changed clothes and combed her hair, then walked out supported by her husband.

She seemed nervous, constantly adjusting her collar.

Careful, afraid of embarrassing her son.

Sophia smiled. "Auntie, the food is delicious. Uncle is a great cook!"

Mrs. Watson smiled. "He used to be a chef… Eat more if you like it!"

Hannah patted her stomach. "I'm really full!"

"Please, don't stand on ceremony…"

"Really, I'm full!"

Mrs. Watson seemed in better spirits. "Walter, turn on the TV for the kids."

"It's late. Stay the night. Chloe Sullivan can sleep with us. Sophia and Hannah can take Chloe Sullivan's room. Marcus, you can share with Caleb."

"Okay. Thank you, Auntie."

"What thanks? We should be thanking you for coming all this way to see Caleb, and getting involved in our trouble today…" Mrs. Watson sighed.

The bruises on her waist and legs hadn't faded.

She had tried to get up and help during the day but fell out of bed.

"First thing tomorrow, Caleb will take you to the village entrance. You can take Leo's auto rickshaw to town."
###Chapter 455

Caleb hesitated. "Will Leo agree?"

"Sophia and the others aren't Watsons. They don't fear offending the Croix brothers. Leo won't turn down a profitable deal."

"Alright."

Sophia, Marcus, and Hannah exchanged glances. "Auntie, we don't want to leave."

"No!" Mr. Watson stood abruptly.

Catching himself, he sat back down slowly. "You must leave. Connor and Sebastian Croix are returning tomorrow. Those brothers are rabid dogs—capable of anything!"

For their safety, they had to depart before dawn.

Caleb agreed. "It's too dangerous here. Return to Kyoto immediately. Jude is still hospitalized. I can't risk anything happening to you..."

Seeing their resolve was firm, they stopped arguing.

In Chloe Sullivan's room—

Caleb meticulously cleaned every corner.

Mrs. Watson brought fresh linens and had him remake the beds.

"...All set. Rest now. I'll wake you in the morning."

Sophia and Hannah lay down.

Late night, silence enveloped everything.

In the darkness, Hannah turned over again—

"Sophia..." she whispered.

"Hmm?"

"Are you cold?"

"A little," Sophia admitted honestly.

Hannah's teeth chattered. "How is the south colder than the north?"

She suddenly missed last night's small hotel.

Sophia took her hand and rubbed it. "The bed hasn't warmed up yet. It'll get better."

Hannah pouted. "It's been so long already..."

Just as Sophia was about to speak, faint voices came from outside.

It was Mrs. Watson.

"Sweetie, take these quilts to the sisters."

Chloe Sullivan: "Should I ask brother to carry one?"

"Brother shouldn't go in. You can make two trips."

"Okay."

Footsteps approached, followed by a knock—

"Sophia? Hannah? Are you asleep? Mom sent me with extra quilts."

Sophia quickly opened the door.

"Sophia, Mom thought you might not be used to our weather. It gets cold at night. These are newly made quilts, never used. Add them if you're cold."

"Thank you, Chloe Sullivan."

"You're welcome."

Chloe Sullivan set down the quilts and brought another.

Sophia and Hannah each added a quilt, finally feeling warm.

"Sophia, are we really leaving tomorrow?"

"We can't. If we leave, Caleb's family is finished."

"Yeah! I think so too!"

Remembering the day's events, Hannah's mood sank. "...Thinking back, I was too impulsive. What if those thugs had really attacked..."

She thought in this age of social media, threatening to expose them would make them back down.

She forgot cornered dogs will bite.

Her impulsiveness nearly endangered Sophia and Marcus, and made the Watsons' situation more precarious.

They came to help, but only made things worse.

"Don't think that. You were brave. But next time, be more cautious. Don't put yourself in danger."

"Okay! I understand. Those two are coming back tomorrow. What should we do?"

"If we can't fight them..."

"?"

"We find reinforcements."

...

Kyoto. The moonlight was cold.

Alexander Laurent just arrived home. Turning on the light, he saw the stack of documents on his table.

He meant to give them to Sophia.

Returning that afternoon, he knocked on her door. No one answered.

He hung up his coat and glanced at the clock. Ten exactly.

She should be back by now?

Alexander picked up the documents, opened his door, and walked across the hall—

"Sophia? Are you home? It's me."

No response.

Worried, he took out his phone, about to call her.

But she called first—

"Hello, Sophia?! Are you home? I have documents for you. No one answered the door."

"Professor, I'm not home. I'm in Yu... Caleb..."

Alexander gripped his phone tightly, barely catching "Caleb." "Where are you?"

The call crackled, full of static, broken and hard to follow.

"Ran into... situation... urgent... tomorrow..."

"Hello? You said Yu Province? Bad signal? Hello? Hello?!"

Alexander pulled the phone away. The call had dropped.

He immediately redialed—

"I'm sorry, the number you have dialed is currently unavailable..."

He hung up and tried again.

Still unavailable.

Meanwhile, Sophia, buried under the quilts, looked helplessly at her disconnected phone. "The signal here is terrible."

"My phone only has one bar. I recorded something today but couldn't upload it..." Hannah lay on her stomach, head resting on her arms.

She'd tried. The signal was slightly better in the open area outside the main door. Getting a call through indoors was pure luck.

"Sophia, should we go outside to call?"

"It's too late. Coming and going isn't convenient. We'll talk tomorrow."

Hannah gave a lazy murmur, eyelids heavy.

As she was about to fall asleep, she mumbled, "Sophia... the reinforcements you mentioned... is it Professor Laurent..."

Sophia paused.

A soft reply came in the dark. "Yes."

Soon, Sophia also fell asleep.

In the middle of the night, both woke up shivering.

They simply squeezed into one bed, layering both quilts for extra warmth.

At dawn the next day, Caleb knocked to wake Sophia and Hannah.

"Let's go. We'll head to the village entrance..."

Sophia got up. They dressed and followed Caleb out.

Just standing in the open area outside the door, Sophia checked her phone. This hour...

She opted for a text.

She texted Alexander their exact location and what the Watsons were facing.

Hannah: "Did it go through, Sophia?"

"Yes, sent."

"Should we contact anyone else? Strength in numbers! I just texted my dad, asked if he had any ideas. He hasn't replied yet, probably still sleeping..."

Sophia thought it made sense. After a moment's consideration, she sent the same message to Sebastian.

Asking her brother for help wasn't really asking—he said so himself.

Unbeknownst to her, the two men who received the messages were together.

And they had been up all night.

Last night around ten, when Alexander's calls failed, he knew something was wrong with Sophia.

And it involved "Caleb."

He immediately called Sophia's academic advisor.

The advisor answered, surprised and flattered. "Professor Laurent? How can I assist you?"

"Where is Sophia Sullivan?" he blurted out.

"Ah?"
###Chapter 456

The academic advisor was stunned for three seconds.

Alexander Laurent asked again.

Only then did she snap out of it. "Sophia Sullivan… she requested leave yesterday."

"For how long? And the reason?"

"She just said she had matters to attend to. I thought, since she's usually either in the lab or the library, and her专业课 are on track… She's taken leave before, so I didn't press for details…"

"Did something happen?" the advisor asked quietly.

Alexander didn't answer.

"What about Caleb Watson's situation?"

The advisor: "Caleb, the third-year grad student?"

"Yes."

"I'm not his advisor, so I'm not sure. I can ask if you need me to."

"...Thank you."

"No trouble at all."

Five minutes later, the advisor called back—

"Professor Laurent, there's an issue with Caleb."

"Go on."

"He hasn't returned to campus since the semester started. His advisor can't reach him. There's one more thing I forgot to mention earlier."

"What is it?"

The advisor: "The day Sophia Sullivan requested leave, Hannah Morse and Marcus Lawrence also requested leave."

"Can you find Caleb's home address?"

"His advisor said the records are incomplete. They only know he's from Chongqing Municipality."

Chongqing…

Right!

Alexander immediately called the head of the academic affairs office.

The man was already asleep. He was surprised to get the call—

"Look up Caleb Watson's file address now?!"

"Yes."

"But the office is closed. We can do it tomorrow…"

"It can't wait until tomorrow. Do it now."

"This…" The man sounded very hesitant.

Alexander's tone was calm. "Just arrange for someone to do it. I'll explain to the president."

"Alright! I'll send someone right away. I'll reply immediately if we find anything."

"Thank you."

He had done all he could.

Now, he could only wait.

Alexander walked onto the balcony for some air.

The cold wind cleared his head.

Two minutes later, he returned to the living room and dialed a number—

"Hello?"

"Sebastian Evans, it's me."

There was a pause on the other end. "...Alexander Laurent?!"

"You didn't save my number."

Sebastian: "..." Was that the point…

"Professor Laurent, what brings you to call me in the middle of the night?"

"It's about Sophia Sullivan."

Sebastian sat up straight. "Tell me."

Alexander told him everything he knew. "...You didn't know either?"

Sebastian: "...She didn't tell me."

Alexander: "You business types have wide networks. If possible, let's work together."

"Good, I'm on my way. Send me Caleb's details. A photo and his ID number will do."

He was going to mobilize his connections.

Alexander: "Alright."

Half an hour later, Sebastian arrived.

Alexander opened the door to let him in.

Sebastian asked for water directly.

As Alexander poured water, he pointed to the floor. "Change your shoes or use shoe covers."

Sebastian: "..."

In the end, he wore shoe covers.

"Water."

"...Thanks."

For a moment, neither spoke.

Twenty minutes later, Sebastian's phone rang. "Okay, tell me…"

At the same time, Alexander's phone also rang.

The head of academic affairs sent Caleb's specific address.

They hung up simultaneously and looked at each other—

"Found it!"

Alexander: "The fastest flight to Chongqing is at 1 a.m. The high-speed train is tomorrow morning."

Sebastian: "Take the flight! I'll arrange for a car to meet us on the Chongqing end. But the car can only go as far as the town. We'll need another way to get into the village."

"Good."

They packed simply and set off immediately.

Alexander carried a travel backpack.

Sebastian only brought his phone and wallet.

At 3 a.m., the plane landed at Chongqing Jiangbei Airport.

Sebastian's contact was already waiting outside the airport.

He took the car keys and told Alexander to get in.

After the highway and the mountain switchbacks, they reached Datong Town at 5:40 a.m.

Dawn hadn't broken yet.

The streetlights were already off.

The small town was completely silent.

Alexander took two bread rolls from his bag. He ate one and handed the other to Sebastian. "Something to tide you over."

Sebastian took it and took a bite. "...Disgusting. So hard."

But he finished it anyway.

Then, Alexander's phone chimed.

It was a WeChat notification.

He picked it up to look—

"It's Sophia!"

Sebastian immediately leaned over. "What did she say?"

"She says she, Hannah, and Marcus are at Caleb's house. The signal is bad… Caleb's family has trouble… Someone came to cause trouble yesterday, it almost came to blows… They're coming again today… She's asking me to help think of a solution…"

Sophia's account matched what the two of them had found out.

Alexander put his phone away. "She said those people are coming again today. We need to get into the village quickly."

Sebastian didn't move.

Alexander called his name again.

Still no reaction.

"Sebastian Evans? Choking on the bread?"

Alexander unfastened his seatbelt to check. Sebastian suddenly turned, speaking幽ly—

"Why only ask you?"

Alexander: "?"

"Why not ask me? Am I worse than you at handling this sort of thing?"

"..."

"Aren't I closer to her than you are?"

"..."

"Why?"

"..."

The four soul-searching questions left Alexander speechless.

Sebastian was full of resentment.

Just as Alexander was about to say something, Sebastian's phone chimed.

Also a WeChat notification.

He glanced at it casually, about to dismiss it, when his eyes suddenly lit up.

His whole demeanor instantly perked up.

Alexander: "?"

Sebastian opened WeChat and shoved it in his face—

"Ehe, she texted me too. I knew she wouldn't only text you."

"The signal must be bad!"

"Maybe she texted me first, and it was just delayed."

Alexander: "..." Yes, yes.

You're right.
###Chapter 457

She said they were friends.

How would Alexander Laurent get into the village?
Sebastian Evans had it arranged.
"I called for an auto rickshaw. Only those can handle the village roads."

"How long is the wait?"
He checked the time. "Half an hour."

"Okay."

…

Sophia Sullivan put her phone away.
Caleb Watson urged her. "The vehicle is at the village entrance. Let's go."

Moore Ermang had initially refused to take them.
But this morning, he suddenly changed his tune.
He said someone offered him a hefty sum to pick up a person.
Taking them along for extra cash was a bonus.

Caleb pressed anxiously. "We're running out of time…"
Sophia and Hannah Morse stood still.
Caleb was stunned.

Sophia said calmly, "We're not leaving."
Hannah nodded. "Mhm~"

Caleb grew frantic. "Didn't we agree last night?"
Hannah blinked. "Who agreed? You were the only one talking."

Caleb was speechless.
"This place is too dangerous! The Croix brothers are mad dogs! They bite!"

Sophia cut him off. "Caleb."
"…What?"
"Are we still friends?"

He fell silent.
Sophia pressed. "Are we or not?"

"It's precisely because we're friends that I can't drag you into this!"
The image of Jude Granger's miserable condition was still vivid.
Blood everywhere. His parents begging on their knees.
Caleb had nightmares every night.
He couldn't involve his friends again.

"Please, just go! Take the bus to the high-speed rail station. You can be back in Cambridge today."

Sophia looked straight at him. "We appreciate your concern. But if we leave and something happens to you, we'd never forgive ourselves."
"If it were you, would you abandon your friends?"

"I'm sorry…" Caleb clutched his head in agony. "I never should have dragged you into this…"

Hannah sighed softly. "Trust us. Facing this together is better than you bearing it alone."
"Auntie needs to go to the hospital. The Croix family has blocked the roads. Delaying will only make it worse."
"You can't return to school. You'll face penalties, even expulsion."
"Is that the outcome you want?"

Caleb's entire body went rigid.
He finally slumped powerlessly onto a pile of firewood.

Sophia turned and walked towards the house. "It's still dark. Let's get some more sleep."
The real battle was yet to come.

Hannah immediately followed. "Me too! I'm freezing!"
This time, Caleb didn't stop them.
He watched their retreating figures, his vision blurring with tears.
Yet, a warmth spread through his chest.

Sophia stopped at the bedroom door.
Hannah halted beside her.
Sophia pointed to the adjacent bedroom.
Hannah gently pushed the door open a crack—

Marcus Lawrence was actually fast asleep.
He didn't even bother pretending.

Hannah was speechless. "Unbelievable."
Sophia raised an eyebrow. "Caleb thought he went to the restroom."
"No wonder…"
The restroom trip was a lie. Sneaking off to sleep was the truth.

Hannah suddenly realized. "Then we lost out? We specifically got up, got dressed, and walked to the door?"
Sophia pondered. "We definitely lost out."

…

The rooster crowed. Dawn broke.
The mist hadn't yet dissipated.
Opening the door revealed open land, with rolling mountains in the distance.

Hannah exclaimed, "Mountain Town lives up to its name!"
It was all mountains along the way.

The sky was tinged with red. Caleb looked up. "It might be sunny today."
Hannah was delighted. "Really?"
It was finally going to warm up.

Mr. Watson helped Mrs. Watson outside.
The barefoot doctor said Mrs. Watson shouldn't lie in bed too long. She needed to move around.
Every morning, Mr. Watson accompanied her for a walk in the yard.

The couple panicked when they saw Sophia and the other two were still there—
"Was the vehicle unavailable? Old Walter, go quickly and call Lee Sanwa…"

Hannah explained gently. "Auntie, we chose to stay ourselves."
Mrs. Watson was shocked. "You kids… why won't you listen? Please go… Caleb, talk some sense into your classmates!"

All three looked at Caleb.
Caleb was silent for a moment, then slowly raised his head. "Mom, let them stay. They won't leave anyway."
"This is a sin…"
"They came all this way to find you. Our home is poor, we can't host them properly. At the very least, we can't let the children take risks!"

Caleb nodded. "I know. But they want to help us."
He never accepted help before.
Proud and annoyingly aloof.
He owed no one.
But Sophia and the others were different.
She said they were friends.
Friends…

Mr. Watson sighed, turned, and went into the kitchen to make breakfast.
If the Croix brothers came again, he would stand in front with a knife.
He'd risk his life to protect these kids.
He swore it to himself.

…

At ten in the morning, the Croix brothers returned.
Sophia, Hannah, and Marcus exchanged glances, feeling relieved instead.
What was coming would come.
Who was afraid of whom?

Connor Croix kicked over a wooden stool with a loud crash.
Sebastian Croix "accidentally" knocked over the washstand with his stick.
Hannah gritted her teeth in anger.
Remembering Sophia's words, she took a deep breath and sat back down.

Connor scanned the group. "Well, look who's all here? Perfect."
Xu Kang slapped a contract down in front of Mr. Watson.
###Chapter 458

"Uncle Walter, you've stalled long enough."

"I brought a pen. Just sign. The money will be in your account immediately."

Mr. Watson's face was tight. "Connor, I said no. It's the woodlot. The cherry trees are still there. I won't sell."

"I call you 'Uncle' out of respect for our village ties. My father and you have some history. Don't make this ugly. We still have to be neighbors."

Bang—

Sebastian Croix swung a club onto the table. "Bro, why waste words on this cripple? He won't listen until we teach him a lesson!"

"Sebastian! Shut up! Show some respect to your elder!"

"Respect my ass! He's stubborn. A beating will make him compliant!"

"Be patient." Connor signaled for his brother to calm down. He turned to Caleb. "If Uncle Walter won't sign, his son can do it. Sebastian—"

Sebastian grabbed Caleb by the collar and shoved a pen into his hand. "You're the educated one. Prestigious university. Don't make me get rough. Sign it. It's better for everyone."

Marcus Lawrence frowned. He knocked Sebastian's hand away and pulled Caleb back. "Use your words. Keep your hands to yourself!"

Sebastian's cold gaze swept over Marcus. "Who the hell are you? Ruined things yesterday, and now you're back. How many lives do you think you have?"

Marcus gave a cold laugh. "What? You'd actually try to kill me?"

"Heh. There's nothing I wouldn't do!"

"Then I just don't believe you today—"

"You're asking for it!"

The club swung down, but Marcus dodged it nimbly.

"Oho, some training?" Sebastian raised an eyebrow, a flash of excitement in his eyes.

"None of your damn business."

Sebastian's eyes turned fierce. He raised his club and charged. Marcus seized the moment to dart out the door.

"You little bastard—stop right there!"

One chased, the other fled.

Connor couldn't stop them in time.

Idiot! The goal today was to force the cripple to sign the contract, not to fight!

That city kid was clearly doing this on purpose.

Connor suddenly frowned.

What was his goal?

Buying time?

A distraction?

Wait—

There were two girls yesterday. Where were they now?

A bad feeling hit him. He stood and headed for the bedrooms.

He kicked open the nearest door. It was Mrs. Watson, bedridden and ill.

He cursed under his breath and pushed open another, quickly scanning it. Empty.

As he moved to kick in the last door, Mr. Watson rushed forward and blocked it with his arms.

"Connor Croix, don't you go too far!"

"Heh. Hiding the girls in here, are you? Get out of my way! I want to see what trick you're playing!"

Mr. Watson gritted his teeth. "This is my house. You have no right to—"

"Calling you 'Uncle' made you think you're actually senior? What are you?! I said, get out of the way!"

"Over my dead body—"

"Seems the girls are inside after all!"

Connor grabbed Mr. Watson by the shoulders and shoved him aside. He raised his foot to kick the door open.

The room was silent. Empty.

Why did the cripple block it then?

A sinking feeling settled in Connor's gut. Something was wrong.

He turned and seized Mr. Watson's collar. "Talk! What game are you playing?!"

Just then, a scream came from outside—

"Bro! Help me!"

Connor's face changed. He released Mr. Watson and rushed out.

Sebastian was sitting on the concrete in front of the house, a sickle embedded deep in his right thigh.

Half the blade was buried, almost piercing clean through.

"Sebastian—" Connor rushed forward, wanting to help but afraid to touch the weapon.

A large stain of blood soaked through Sebastian's fleece-lined jeans, the dark blue fabric turning black.

"Sebastian, how bad is it?! I'll call a car to get you to the hospital!"

"Don't—" Sebastian grabbed his arm, looking up slowly, his face contorted in pain. He glared hatefully at Marcus Lawrence nearby, and at Sophia Sullivan, Hannah Morse, and Chloe Sullivan Watson hiding by the side of the house.

"Bro, I can take it! Before the hospital, get payback for this!"

"And those two girls—I saw them filming on their phones. Don't let that video get out!"

Connor paused. "...Alright. Stop the bleeding first."

He took out his phone and dialed a number—

"Marco, my brother's hurt. Lend me a few guys..."

Marcus saw the situation turning bad and immediately moved to get Sophia and the others away.

Caleb called for his parents too.

But Connor wouldn't let them leave.

He cracked his neck, his knuckles popping. "Stab my brother and think you can just walk away? Not that easy!"

Marcus: "He ran into it himself. Who's to blame?"

"Kid, you've got some nerve!"

"Thanks for the compliment."

Connor laughed angrily, unsure whether to praise the foolhardiness or curse the audacity. "I wanted to settle this peacefully with a signature. But someone doesn't know when to quit, and stabbed my brother. Fine then. Nobody leaves!"

"Whether we leave or not isn't your call. Move aside—" Marcus stepped to the front, shielding the others.

Hannah stared at him, stunned.

For the first time, she thought Marcus wasn't just handsome, but really manly!

Seeing this, Caleb handed his mother to his father, picked up a nearby hoe, and stepped up beside Marcus.

Caleb: "We can't delay. We have to go now! Connor called for backup."

Marcus nodded.

Connor was tough, but with Sebastian injured and out of the fight, he couldn't hold off Marcus and Caleb alone.

Just as the two pushed Connor into a corner, ready to make their escape—

A group of rough-looking young men suddenly surrounded them.

Five or six of them!

Caleb's face paled. "They're here!"

Only five minutes had passed since Connor's call. They must have been from the village.

Connor scrambled up from the ground, furious. "Disarm them! Grab them all!"
###Chapter 459

Marcus Lawrence quickly turned to look at Sophia Sullivan.

Sophia shook her head gently.

Marcus stopped resisting.

Caleb Watson still wanted to struggle.

Marcus held him down.

"Listen to me," Marcus whispered urgently.

Caleb frowned.

Mr. Walter Watson was quickly subdued.

Chloe Sullivan Watson shielded her mother as they huddled in the corner.

Mother and daughter trembled with fear.

Hannah Morse was pinned face-first against the dirt wall, her hands restrained behind her back.

Connor Croix sneered as he closed in on Sophia.

"Hand it over."

Sophia stepped back.

"I don't understand."

"Your phone," Connor's eyes were vicious. "Don't make me repeat myself."

Sophia let out a cold laugh. "You think I'd just wait for you to take it?"

"You sent it out?"

"Of course."

Connor suddenly grinned. "Fine. Send it."

He looked Sophia up and down. "Caleb's classmate? From out of town? His girlfriend?"

Sophia felt sick.

Hannah yelled desperately, "Get away from her!"

Connor turned his head. "You can't even save yourself, and you still have a sharp tongue?"

"Jealous of her? I wouldn't touch a fat sow like you."

Hannah shook with rage.

She looked anxiously toward the village entrance.

Why weren't they here yet?

Sophia was backed into a corner.

"You like a poor loser like Caleb?" Connor scoffed. "Could he even afford to keep you?"

"Could a weakling like him satisfy you?"

Sophia tried to run.

Connor grabbed her.

"Running?" He pulled down his zipper. "I'll be gentle…"

His words were cut short.

He was yanked up and thrown violently to the ground.

Sophia breathed a sigh of relief.

They were finally here.

Alexander Laurent restrained Connor's hands.

Sebastian Evans punched him, again and again.

"Pretty face?"

"Nice body?"

"Cooperative?"

"What are you?"

"Worth it?"

"Satisfied now?"

The blows were heavy and brutal.

Connor coughed up blood.

Sebastian was drenched in sweat.

"Let my brother go!" Sebastian Croix screamed.

Alexander released his grip.

Connor dropped to the ground like a ragdoll.

Alexander crouched to examine Sebastian's wound.

"He'll live."

He stood up, deliberately stepping on the injury.

The knife sank deeper.

Sebastian howled in agony.

Blood gushed out anew.

All of Connor's men were subdued.

A man in black barked, "Stay down!"

Sebastian Croix threatened, "You're messing with Marco's people!"

No one paid him any attention.

Hannah rushed forward and slapped one of the thugs across the face.

"Don't hit the face!"

The thug was stunned.

Marcus stepped in to stop her.

"Your hand will hurt."

Hannah pouted. "Luckily they arrived in time."

Marcus then backhanded the thug with much greater force.

The slap rang out sharply.

Hannah stared in shock.

The thug was dumbfounded.

Marcus said calmly, "I'll hit him for you."

"You're the best, Marcus."

"Just noticing that today?"

"It's especially obvious today!"

"...Oh." A slight smile touched Marcus's lips.

Alexander and Sebastian both moved toward Sophia.

"Are you okay?"

"Are you hurt?"

Sophia shook her head. "You came at the perfect time."

She wasn't surprised.

After she sent the message this morning.

Both had replied.

They had rushed to the town overnight.

They were just about to enter the village.

Sophia had told Hannah and Marcus.

The three of them formulated a plan.

Stall for time.

Gather evidence.

Let Mr. Watson and Caleb negotiate first.

Marcus stayed nearby.

Sophia and Hannah took Chloe Sullivan and hid outside.

After the talks broke down, Marcus provoked the Croix brothers.

Sebastian took the bait and was lured outside.

They recorded evidence in a public place.

The villagers became eyewitnesses.

The sickle was an accident.

Marcus quickly regained his composure.

Self-defense.

There was video proof.

Sebastian deserved it.

Hannah was puzzled. "You were already in town. Why did it take so long to get here?"

Alexander and Sebastian exchanged a look.

Alexander gestured. "You tell them?"

Sebastian smirked. "Fine, I'll tell you…"
###Chapter 460

The auto rickshaw set off at seven-thirty.

Sebastian was jostled until he vomited.

Alexander turned to look out the window.

Sebastian finished rinsing his mouth.

His first sentence.

I'm not carsick.

His second sentence.

Your bread was bad.

Alexander let out a faint "Oh."

Sebastian emphasized.

I really am not.

Alexander said calmly.

I didn't say you were.

Sebastian glared.

Your expression clearly said it was!

Alexander thought to himself.

It was truly an injustice.

He really wanted to laugh, though.

The driver kindly interjected.

If you're carsick, just open the window for some air.

Sebastian gritted his teeth.

I! Am! Not! Carsick!

The driver chuckled.

Northerners are all like this.

Too proud for their own good.

Alexander's gaze flickered.

You've driven other Northerners?

The driver nodded.

A few young people just the other day.

There was a guy just like him.

Vomiting his guts out but refusing to admit it.

Sebastian sat up straight.

Was it two women and one man?

Going to the Chen family in Lower Dam Village?

The driver was surprised.

You know them!

The two men exchanged a look.

They seized the chance to ask about the Chen family.

When the Xu brothers were mentioned.

The driver immediately clammed up.

Sebastian pulled out his wallet.

There were plenty of bank cards.

But not a single dollar in cash.

Just as he was regreting.

A stack of bills was handed to him.

Alexander showed him to give it to the driver.

Sebastian glanced at the backpack.

He silently took the money.

He thought he should carry a bag next time too.

Bring everything.

He lit a cigarette for himself first.

Took a couple of puffs.

Then offered one to the driver.

Brother Moore.

The term "brother" made Alexander look over.

Sebastian actually called someone 'brother'?

Sebastian raised an eyebrow.

Surprised?

This is a business technique.

Alexander was speechless.

The driver smiled and took the cigarette.

And it's Hua Zi.

He could tell just by the smell.

Sebastian gave a light hum.

You know your stuff.

The driver was proud.

Of course.

Sebastian lit the cigarette for him.

The driver wanted to refuse.

But his actions were quite honest.

Sebastian stuffed the money into his pocket.

The driver completely opened up.

From the Xu family's rise to fortune.

To the brothers' evil deeds.

He held nothing back.

Alexander and Sebastian grew more and more solemn as they listened.

Going alone wouldn't work.

They needed to call for backup.

Sebastian spoke.

Drop us off at the village entrance.

The driver was surprised.

Not going to the Chen's?

...

Hannah looked at the two big men.

Mr. Evans went to call for backup?

Sebastian nodded.

Hannah blinked.

What about Professor Laurent?

She didn't ask further.

The beaten thug suddenly started shouting.

Where did you country bumpkins come from?

Let us go now!

Hannah sneereded.

Dreaming?

Want another slap?

Marcus raised his hand.

The thug flinched in fear.

Are these two slap-happy maniacs?

Toxic!

I have people behind me.

You're finished if you touch me!

Hannah nodded.

Fine.

She exchanged a look with Marcus.

They both stepped forward simultaneously.

Left and right.

Slap! Slap! Slap!

Blood trickled from the corner of the thug's mouth.

You...

Hannah raised an eyebrow.

Let's see if your boss can teleport here.

Marcus added.

I'll test it too.

The thug was baffled.

Crazy! You're actually crazy!

My boss is Marco!

You're finished!

Hannah was surprised.

Marco?

The thug puffed out his chest.

Scared now? Too late!

Hannah looked at Marcus.

That name sounds like a TV show villain.

Marcus nodded.

The big bad in an anti-crime drama.

Who gets killed off in the end.

The thug was speechless.

Connor slowly regained consciousness.

He gritted his teeth and struggled to his feet.

He swayed as he stood steady.

You can't afford to mess with Marco!

He waved his phone.

I already called him.

He'll be here soon!

Mr. Watson's face paled.

He urged Caleb to take everyone and leave.

Hurry! Go to the county town!

Connor laughed loudly.

Scared now, Caleb the Cripple?

Too late!

I will have my revenge today!

Mr. Watson trembled all over.

Pushing Caleb.

Hurry, take everyone and go!

Caleb came to his senses.

Okay!

A sputtering sound approached.

Five or six auto rickshaws stopped.

A bald man got out.

A thin, gaunt young man followed behind.

Three or four people got out of each vehicle.

They stood in a row.

It had the vibe of a Hong Kong movie gang fight.

Alexander frowned.

He moved to shield Sophia Sullivan behind him.

Marcus and Hannah stepped forward.

Also shielding the people behind them.

Mr. Watson's face was ashen.

He pulled his wife and children behind him.

Connor helped Sebastian Croix up.

They scrambled over.

Marco! You're finally here—

He called out to the gaunt young man.
###Chapter 461

This was the "Marco" they kept talking about.

Their backup had arrived.

The beaten thugs struggled to get back on their feet.

They hid behind Marco.

Everyone started talking at once.

"Marco! It's them! They beat up Connor and Sebastian!"

"They even attacked us!"

"You have to teach them a lesson!"

"Hitting us is like slapping you in the face!"

"The Marco Gang can't be humiliated like this!"

...

The lanky young man's face darkened.

Connor Croix was overjoyed.

He could already picture these people on their knees begging for mercy.

But the next second.

Thump—

He took a heavy punch to the corner of his eye.

Connor was completely stunned.

Sebastian Croix, covered in blood, didn't escape either.

A hard slap landed on his face.

"Marco?!"

The two couldn't believe it.

"Why are you hitting us?"

"Idiots!" Marco started kicking and punching the thugs.

"A bunch of blind fools!"

"How dare you cause trouble in front of Mr. Quincy!"

He turned to the bald man.

His face full of讨好.

"Mr. Quincy, I'm sorry you had to see this joke."

The bald man, Mr. Quincy, smiled faintly.

"Marco, you're doing well. Recruiting lackeys and even forming a Marco Gang?"

"Planning to branch out on your own?"

Marco's face turned pale.

He quickly bowed.

"No, no! It's a misunderstanding, Mr. Quincy!"

"I'm your lackey, so they are your lackeys too!"

He glared fiercely at Connor and Sebastian.

"What are you waiting for? Greet Mr. Quincy!"

Connor had already been beaten by Sebastian Evans.

Now he took a punch from his own backup.

Sebastian was worse off.

Bleeding from his leg.

Slapped in the face.

And now he had to bow and scrape.

"Hello, Mr. Quincy! We were blind."

The bald man remained expressionless.

Sebastian's eyes darted.

"Mr. Quincy, we're your people!"

"These people came to the village to pick a fight. They have no respect for you!"

Connor nodded repeatedly.

"We were just waiting for your orders—"

Marco also looked at Mr. Quincy.

He had been with Mr. Quincy when he got the call.

Mr. Quincy said he wanted to come along.

Marco was flattered.

He brought his men rushing over.

Just waiting for Mr. Quincy's command.

But—

Mr. Quincy remained silent.

His expression unreadable.

Marco was about to add more details.

A slap landed on his face.

Marco was completely stunned.

"Mr. Quincy?!"

Everyone was shocked.

Connor and Sebastian were dumbfounded.

The bald man didn't even look at him.

He walked up to Sebastian Evans with a smile.

"Mr. Evans, you should have told me you were coming."

"I could have played host properly."

Sebastian Evans was calm.

"No need. Let's deal with the matter at hand first."

Mr. Quincy nodded with a smile.

"Of course!"

He then looked at the two big men.

"Mr. Evans, are they satisfactory?"

"Quite." Sebastian Evans nodded.

"Good."

So the men were lent by Mr. Quincy.

Connor and Sebastian exchanged a glance.

Their faces turned pale.

The two tried to slip away.

Mr. Quincy's men immediately grabbed them.

They were brought before Sebastian Evans.

Mr. Quincy asked, "How would you like to handle this, Mr. Evans?"

Sebastian Evans gave a light laugh.

"Your men, you decide."

Mr. Quincy glanced at the two.

His tone suddenly turned cold.

"Break one of each of their hands."

"No, Mr. Quincy!"

"We were wrong! Have mercy on us!"

The two kowtowed and begged for mercy.

Mr. Quincy remained unmoved.

He raised his hand, signaling his men to proceed.

Alexander Laurent suddenly spoke.

"Clean up your own mess behind closed doors."

"Don't spill blood on someone else's doorstep."

Only then did everyone realize they were still at the Watson family's door.

In broad daylight.

Mr. Quincy nodded.

His men immediately dragged the Croix brothers away.

Connor and Sebastian had just breathed a sigh of relief.

They knew they were doomed.

Connor's eyes darted.

"Stop! I'm calling the police!"

Yes, the police!

"They attacked us! Our injuries are proof!"

"Sebastian, call them now!"

Mr. Quincy raised an eyebrow.

He looked at Marco with a faint smile.

"Your lackey has some brains."

But not many.

Marco looked embarrassed.

Sebastian had already called the police.

"...Cooperation Group Two, Lower Dam Village, outside the Watson residence."

Mr. Quincy said to Sebastian Evans with a smile.

"Mr. Evans, you see."

"It's not that I don't want to clean house."

"They want to call the police, so I won't interfere."

He waved his hand.

Everyone got into the auto rickshaws.

They had arrived in a noisy crowd.

Now they left in a single file.

Just like that, they were gone?

Connor was delighted.

Mr. Quincy wasn't going to deal with them!

The brothers breathed a sigh of relief.

Their hands were safe.

Hannah Morse didn't understand this move.

Marcus Lawrence explained in a low voice.

"If Mr. Quincy took them, they'd be finished."

"Calling the police is seeking official protection."

"Mr. Quincy's men are afraid of the police."

"But we have evidence. Aren't they walking right into a trap by calling the police?"

Marcus Lawrence sneered.

"They definitely have a backup plan."

Alexander Laurent suddenly checked his watch.

"It's about time."

Everyone was confused.

The police arrived quickly.

Connor smiled and stepped forward with a cigarette.

But he realized these weren't officers from the town police station.

They were unfamiliar faces.

"Connor Croix? Sebastian Croix? We're from the Municipal Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division."

"We received a report last night. You are suspected of organized crime."

"Please come with us for investigation!"

This twist was sudden.

The two Croix brothers were stunned.

The three from the Sullivan group were also speechless.

Hannah looked at Marcus Lawrence.

"Did you call for backup?"

Otherwise, how did the city police arrive so quickly?

Marcus Lawrence shook his head.

"I didn't."

"Then who did?"

Hannah suddenly thought of something.

She sharply turned to look at Alexander Laurent.
###Chapter 462

The leader from the Municipal Bureau gave Alexander Laurent a nod.

"We'll take them in now."

"Good. I recommend a urine test."

"Understood."

The Croix brothers' faces turned pale.

They finally realized they'd messed with the wrong people.

The police cars arrived quickly and left just as fast.

Sebastian Evans raised an eyebrow. "First time I've seen the Municipal Bureau move so fast."

Alexander Laurent just smiled without a word.

Hannah Morse looked from one to the other.

Suddenly, it dawned on her.

The professor was late because he was calling in favors.

Mr. Evans handled the underworld.

The professor handled the authorities.

A two-pronged approach!

They had blocked every escape route for the Croix brothers.

...

That evening, the Watson household was as lively as a festival.

Mr. Watson had been busy since the afternoon.

Killing chickens, preparing ducks, slicing fish...

He wanted to put every good thing on the table.

He even dug up the daughter's wine buried underground.

It was originally the dowry wine prepared for Chloe Sullivan Watson.

Everyone quickly tried to stop him.

But Mr. Watson insisted on opening it.

He had been in the kitchen all afternoon.

He only came out to greet everyone as dusk fell.

"The food is ready, please sit!"

The large round table was laden with delicacies.

Boiled fish and ginger fried duck took the center stage.

There was also blood tofu stew, steamed pork belly, stir-fried liver and kidney...

Hannah couldn't help but swallow.

The aroma had long filled the entire courtyard.

Spicy and fragrant, it made one's mouth water.

Mr. Watson looked a bit embarrassed.

"I made some local dishes, didn't use too much chili..."

Hannah was the first to nod.

"It's delicious! Really good!"

She was originally afraid of spicy food.

But she found it different upon tasting.

Spicy yet fragrant, with a sweet aftertaste.

Sophia Sullivan praised sincerely, "Uncle, your cooking is amazing."

Marcus Lawrence nodded. "You could open a restaurant."

Mrs. Watson smiled.

She looked much better than before.

"We used to run a small restaurant. Business was quite good."

She spoke softly of the past.

"Later, my health declined. The doctor said I shouldn't overwork."

"We couldn't afford to hire help. Walter couldn't manage alone, so we had to close the shop and find work elsewhere."

Mr. Watson gently patted her hand under the table.

He stood up with his wine glass.

"Thank you, everyone, for today."

His voice was slightly choked.

"If it weren't for you, our family might have fallen apart."

"Caleb is fortunate to have classmates and teachers like you."

"My gratitude is in this wine!"

He finished the glass in one go.

Caleb and Chloe Sullivan also toasted everyone.

After three glasses, Sophia felt slightly tipsy.

She rested her chin on her hand and looked at the dishes on the table.

Her gaze inadvertently met Alexander Laurent's.

They both froze for a moment.

Sophia suddenly flashed a bright smile.

It dazzled Alexander's eyes.

And stirred the calm waters of his heart.

"Ahem!" Sebastian Evans coughed heavily.

They quickly looked away.

Sebastian snorted coldly.

Hannah asked with concern, "Mr. Evans, what's wrong?"

Marcus tried to pull her sleeve, but it was too late.

Sebastian gritted his teeth. "It's a bit spicy."

"Very spicy? I think it's okay. Have some water."

Sebastian: "...Okay."

Thank you so much!

Hannah turned. "Marcus, why were you pulling me just now?"

Marcus: ...

It's nothing.

Wouldn't dare to have an opinion.

Let's just leave it at that.

...

After dinner, Mr. Watson busied himself cleaning the kitchen.

Hannah sat in the main room warming herself by the fire.

Chloe Sullivan had specially prepared two charcoal braziers for her.

"Hannah, use these for now. I'll add more charcoal later."

"Chloe Sullivan, you're the best~"

Chloe Sullivan ran off shyly.

Hannah warmed herself by the fire, feeling cozy all over.

She watched Mr. Watson's busy figure in the kitchen.

Back and forth, never tiring.

It was the first time she'd seen a man so skilled at kitchen work.

The saying "a gentleman stays away from the kitchen" clearly didn't apply here.

The key was that the Watson family found it completely normal.

Marcus asked softly, "What are you thinking about?"

Hannah propped her chin. "In the future, I want to find a husband who can cook!"

Marcus raised an eyebrow. "That's it?"

Hannah glared. "It's very important!"

"Being able to cook shows he knows how to live, has a good temper, is patient, and most importantly, pleases a foodie!"

Marcus nodded thoughtfully.

In the backyard—

Alexander and Sebastian called Caleb over.

Sophia was also there.

Alexander handed over a business card.

"This is Professor Feng, a top nephrology expert in the country."

"He'll be consulting at Southwest Hospital on the third of next month."

"Take your mother directly to him. All subsequent treatments will be arranged."

Caleb took the card excitedly.

"Thank you, Professor Laurent!"

"Don't mention it. Contact me anytime if there are problems."

This number was Professor Feng's private line.

Ordinary people couldn't get it.

But Alexander had arranged everything.

Sebastian suddenly spoke.

"What are your plans next?"

Caleb was stunned. "Plans?"

Sebastian instinctively reached for his pants pocket.

He glanced at Sophia and withdrew his hand.

He shoved his hands into his pockets.

"The Croix brothers are in, but their father is still out."

"Given the Croix family's style, that father probably isn't a good guy either..."
###Chapter 463

Sophia Sullivan: This Isn't Right

Sebastian Evans's meaning was clear.

Defeat the young ones, and the old one arrives.

This old one was even more troublesome than the young.

He was warning Caleb Watson to prepare early.

"...The Croix family's most urgent task right now is getting Connor and Sebastian Croix out. They don't have time for revenge yet. Once Vincent Croix realizes he can't save his sons, all his fury will be directed at you."

Caleb's heart tightened.

He was silent for a moment before asking quietly, "Connor and Sebastian Croix are already in. Could the entire Croix family fall too?"

Alexander Laurent paused, telling the truth. "Not necessarily. The existing evidence is enough to convict the Croix brothers. But Vincent Croix... it's hard to say."

What if the father and sons had clear boundaries?

What if Vincent Croix was prepared?

What if...

There were too many variables.

Alexander Laurent couldn't guarantee anything.

Caleb smiled bitterly.

He had thought winning today would mean it was all over.

Reality was far more complicated.

Sebastian Evans spoke. "Don't overestimate the Croix family. They can only throw their weight around in this village. Outside this town, they're nothing."

"Avoiding Vincent Croix's revenge isn't exactly difficult, but it's not simple either."

Caleb looked up. "What do you mean, Mr. Evans?"

"Move."

The Croix family's influence didn't extend beyond the village.

If the Watson family moved to the county seat or the city, Vincent Croix would be powerless.

Staying in the village meant constant harassment.

Mrs. Watson's health required better medical care.

Chloe Sullivan Watson should be starting high school soon.

The city had better educational resources.

"These are just suggestions. The decision is yours."

Caleb smiled bitterly. "I understand the logic..."

But where would the money come from?

Houses in the city weren't cheap.

Renting cost money too.

Mrs. Watson's medical treatments required money.

The Watson family's income only came from Caleb's part-time job and that orchard.

If they moved to the city, what about the orchard?

They had opposed the Croix family to protect their home.

Now they were supposed to abandon it?

But the Croix family's revenge... He didn't dare gamble.

Caleb was caught in a dilemma.

Sebastian Evans didn't press further.

Everyone had their own choices to make.

That night, Caleb didn't sleep.

Sophia Sullivan, Marcus Lawrence, Hannah Morse, Alexander Laurent, and Sebastian Evans stayed at a hotel in town.

The conditions were average.

They were more concerned about Caleb's decision.

Sophia sat at the front desk, staring out at the night sky, lost in thought.

Alexander Laurent's voice broke her reverie.

"Still awake?"

"Professor Laurent," she snapped back to reality and smiled. "You're not resting either?"

Alexander Laurent: "Couldn't sleep."

Sophia Sullivan: "Because of Caleb?"

"You too?"

She nodded gently.

Alexander Laurent asked, "You were quiet earlier. Did you have other thoughts?"

Sophia was silent for a moment.

Just as Alexander thought she wouldn't answer, she spoke—

"I think it's wrong."

The man was taken aback. "What's wrong?"

Sophia Sullivan: "We're all thinking about how to avoid the Croix family's revenge. But why should we avoid it? The Croix family is clearly in the wrong. Why should the victims run?"

She felt there was a problem with Sebastian Evans's line of thinking.

Moving away seemed like the optimal solution.

But... it was too humiliating!

Alexander Laurent: "Sometimes avoiding isn't running away. It's giving the bullet time to fly."

"Is that it?" Sophia was stunned.

Sebastian Evans had just said to her—

"Whether the Croix family falls or not isn't important. Darkness always breeds in places like this. Without the Croix family, there would be the Shaw Family, the Li family... We can't change the现状, we can only protect ourselves first."

"You might think I'm cold, but that's the reality. The Watson family will have to leave eventually. It's just a matter of time."

"I'm only suggesting he choose the most correct path."

Sophia still felt it was wrong.

But she couldn't pinpoint why.

People shouldn't bow their heads easily.

They shouldn't let the storms dictate their direction.

Alexander Laurent's words enlightened her.

"Thank you, Professor! I understand now!" She turned and went upstairs to her room.

Alexander Laurent sat where he was: "?"

What did she understand?

…

The light in the Watson family's main room stayed on all night.

Early the next morning, Alexander Laurent and the others returned to the Watson home.

Mr. Watson and Caleb seemed to have reached a decision.

"Professor Laurent, Mr. Evans, my father and I have decided—"
Caleb.
Sophia Sullivan spoke suddenly.

Her voice was soft, yet it silenced everyone present.

Caleb turned to look at her.

Her expression was calm.
Before you decide, there's something you should know.

Caleb nodded seriously.

The compensation structure at Aetheria Labs is comprehensive.
Salaries vary from Research Assistant to Senior Research Scientist.
Both title and research output impact earnings.

Caleb listened quietly.

The lab can advance you a decade's salary.
An initial estimate puts it at four million.
The actual amount could be higher or lower.
But the advance is capped at that figure.

Caleb's head snapped up.

His father was also stunned.

They never imagined research could pay so well.

Sophia continued.
This money can solve your current difficulties.
But it's not a gift.

An advance means you must remain at Aetheria Labs for ten years.
You'll need to meet annual research quotas and pass title evaluations.

This wasn't charity.

It was Sophia's investment.

It was also the lab's method of retaining talent.

Caleb was worth the price.

Caleb and his father exchanged a look.

They had already decided not to leave.

The village at least had the cherry orchard for sustenance.

Moving to the city would make even eating a problem.

If the Croix family sought revenge, they would have to endure it.

They never expected a way out.

Four million.

Enough to buy a city apartment, cover medical bills, fund Chloe Sullivan's education, and start a small business for his father.

If it were a direct handout, Caleb would refuse.

But this was an advance on his salary.

He could accept it with a clear conscience.

Do I need to sign a contract? Caleb asked.

Sophia nodded.
###Chapter 464
Of course.

She produced a contract and pen, prepared in advance.

Caleb read it carefully.

Hannah couldn't help speaking.
Sophia wouldn't trick you!

Marcus Lawrence shook his head.
A contract should always be read thoroughly.

Hannah quickly corrected herself.
I meant her terms are fair, but you should still read it.

Satisfied, Caleb signed his name solemnly.

He returned the contract to Sophia.
I won't let the lab lose money on me.

Sophia offered a faint smile.
I trust my judgment.

This was the second time she had helped him.

Caleb buried his gratitude deep inside.

He would repay her kindness with action.

His parents felt both grateful and guilty.

If not for this family's burdens, their son could have soared higher.

Mom, Dad, we have money now. Caleb smiled at his parents.

He finally believed knowledge could be converted into wealth.

His father was overjoyed.

His wife could get proper hospital care.

His daughter could receive a better education.

Though his legs were bad, he still had strength.
He could start a small business in the city.

Life finally held hope.

The only remaining concern was—

What about the cherry orchard on the back hill?

Alexander Laurent spoke up.
There are agri-companies that specialize in leasing land for orchards.
There's a large one right here in the Chongqing region.

Mr. Watson hesitated.
My plot is too small. Would they want it?

He knew such companies usually leased large tracts.

Alexander shook his head.
Cherries are different.

Local cherries can't withstand long-distance transport.

They must be sold locally.

A leasing company would definitely seek nearby orchards.

Alexander added,
If you're willing, I can help make the connection.

Mr. Watson nodded repeatedly.
Yes! Please! Thank you so much.

Alexander smiled.
It's nothing.

A major company like that wouldn't fear the Croix family.

The orchard would be preserved, providing a stable annual income.

It solved every problem perfectly.

Caleb's phone rang.

It was a new phone, bought for him from town that morning.

Dozens of missed calls flashed on the screen.

His social media was flooded with messages from Sophia and the others.

Caleb was deeply moved again.

He answered the call.

Whatever the speaker said made his eyes suddenly light up.
Really?!
###Chapter 465

"Excellent!" He was so excited he nearly jumped.

"Mr. Granger, I understand. My parents and I will be going to the city in a couple of days, and we'll visit Jude then... Yes, don't worry, it's all resolved... Really, the Croix brothers were taken by the police yesterday... Alright, we'll talk more when we see you."

Hannah Morse immediately asked as he hung up, "Is there news about Jude Granger?"

Caleb Watson turned to Alexander Laurent, his eyes reddening. "Professor Laurent, thank you... truly, thank you... Mr. Granger insisted I thank you in person on his behalf!"

Hannah blinked. "What exactly happened?"

"Mr. Granger just called. Jude has woken up!"

"Really? That's wonderful!" Hannah smiled. "But why are you thanking the Professor?"

Caleb said, "Mr. Granger said Professor Laurent helped arrange the transfer to the city hospital. He brought in specialists for a consultation. Jude woke up without needing surgery."

Sophia Sullivan looked at Alexander in surprise. "When did you arrange this?"

"Yesterday."

"Why didn't you mention it?"

"I contacted the city hospital on the way here."

"You're always so thoughtful."

Sebastian Evans was puzzled. "?" When did he contact them?
Weren't they together the whole time yesterday? Except... when he went to get people from Mr. Quincy...

Incredible!
He even found an opportunity for that!

...

The group stayed one more night at the town's hotel and returned to Kyoto the next day.

Caleb did not accompany them. He would return to school after getting his parents settled.

To prevent the Croix family from causing more trouble after their departure, Sebastian specifically left two of his own men at the Watson home.
They were his personal bodyguards, not Mr. Quincy's people.

Hannah asked curiously, "Mr. Evans, is there a particular reason for this?"

Sebastian, in a good mood, was happy to explain. "Mr. Quincy and I have no personal connection. I reached out to him through intermediaries. Judging by his attitude towards the Croix brothers, his help was genuine, but he was also largely spectating."

"You can't trust that kind of person. All smiles to your face, but they might stab you in the back later. To be safe, using my own people is more reassuring."

That afternoon, the group arrived.

Both Sebastian and Alexander offered to drive Sophia home.

Alexander said, "I'm heading home anyway. It's on the way."

"Alright, thank you, Professor." Sophia nodded with a smile.

Sebastian sat in his Mercedes, watching the two hail a taxi in the rearview mirror before finally looking away. "Drive."

"Where to, young master?"

Sebastian paused. "...The old residence."
He should go see Irene Valdemar.

Theodore Valdemar kept his word.
Since moving out of the old residence, he hadn't returned.

According to the butler, Irene had gone from being "extremely emotionally unstable" initially to "much quieter recently," seemingly accepting the situation.

But Sebastian felt his mother wouldn't surrender so easily.

...

May arrived in the blink of an eye, the weather gradually warming.
Everything was reviving, full of spring vitality.

After returning from Chongqing, Sophia first explained Caleb and Jude's situation to the department leadership, applying for leave and completing the necessary procedures for both.

She also needed to update Professor Eleanor Watson.

After hearing about Caleb's ordeal, Eleanor turned away.
Sophia knew she was secretly wiping her tears.

"I knew that child was exceptional very early on. I occasionally lamented what a pity it was such a promising student ended up with Professor Victoria Lowell, but I never imagined his family circumstances were so difficult..."

"After he transferred to me, I didn't look into these details properly. I failed in my duty."

"Here is ten thousand dollars. Please give it to him for me. It's not much, just a token from his advisor. Any more, and he wouldn't accept it."

Sophia took the money. "I'm not sure he'll take it."

"Tell him directly: one must not refuse a gift from an elder. He will accept."

"Alright."

After handling these matters, Sophia returned to her routine of lab, school, and home.
Once immersed, time flew.

Even Hannah remarked, "Sophia is like a carrot dangling in front of me. Seeing her ahead, no matter how tired I am, I have to keep up."

Marcus Lawrence laughed hearing this.

Hannah frowned. "What's so funny? Aren't you the same?"

Marcus said, "I'm not a donkey."

Hannah: "??"
What did he mean? If he wasn't the donkey, did that mean she was?

Things were going smoothly for Caleb as well.
Shortly after Sophia's group left, he moved his parents out of the village.

The neighbors were all concerned about what would happen to the cherry orchard.
The Croix brothers weren't the only ones who coveted it.

Others were just more cautious and didn't dare make a move.
But in their hearts, everyone was thinking about it.
It was a money-making asset!

Hearing the Watsons were moving away and the Croix brothers were in jail, everyone's minds started working overtime.
Every day, people came to the Watson home, subtly probing Mr. Watson for information.

In Caleb's words—
Their home hadn't been this lively even during the New Year.

Some even directly asked Mr. Watson, since they were moving anyway, if he could just give them the cherry orchard.
Mr. Watson laughed in disbelief.

Even related uncles and伯伯 from the neighboring village heard the news and came over.

Mr. Watson said, "Since everyone is here, I'll say it all at once. The cherry orchard is not for transfer, and certainly not for free."

"Then if you move away, who will manage it? You can't just let it go to waste, right? That's too much of a shame!"

Mr. Watson: "Naturally not. I've already signed a contract handing it over to a management company."

"A management company? You're joking? Would a company want such a small plot? If you don't want to give it, just say so. No need to make up excuses."

After saying this, they all left in a huff.
Once the Watsons moved away, whoever acted fastest would get the orchard, right?

However, the day after the Watsons moved, when the management company's personnel officially took over the cherry orchard, all the villagers were stunned.

"They really gave it to a management company..."

"What incredible luck did the Watson family have? I heard they're buying an apartment in the city! And both Croix brothers are in jail. This is really..."

People are like that. They worry you might be suffering, but they also fear you might suddenly strike it rich.

Caleb found a second-hand apartment near the Southwest Hospital he liked. It came with a school placement, and it was for a good middle school in the Shapingba District.
Three bedrooms, living room, renovated, furnished, with appliances. 1.3 million.
Caleb paid in full outright.

His mother's medical treatment and his sister's schooling were both solved.
He gave the remaining money to his father, suggesting he start a small business if he wanted, but only if he felt he could handle it. Otherwise, he didn't have to.
It was entirely up to him.

After thinking for two days, Mr. Watson decided to sell fresh tofu pudding. He would carry a shoulder pole and sell it in nearby residential areas every day.
He wouldn't go far. Once sold out, he'd go home to cook.
Saving on shop rent meant it was essentially a zero-cost business.

Things were going well for Jude too.
After regaining consciousness, his physical indicators gradually improved.
Half a month later, he was finally discharged from the hospital.
He returned to school and classes on the third day.

He specially invited Alexander Laurent, Sophia Sullivan, Marcus Lawrence, and Hannah Morse for a meal.

"My dad said I must thank the Professor and Sophia in person!"

...

Everything was moving in a positive direction.
Including Sophia's new research project.

The only one who might not be entirely happy was probably...
###Chapter 466

Professor, Was It You?

Florence Atlante set down her watering can.

She walked into the living room.

Yi Chunshan was reading the newspaper.

"What has Clara been busy with lately? The last two times we asked her to come home for dinner, she said she was busy. Counting the time, it's been over a month since we last saw her…"

Yi Chunshan looked up from his paper.

"Look at you. A grown woman, still fussing about wanting her granddaughter to keep her company. What could Sophia be busy with? Either running experiments or writing her thesis. She must have been tied up, that's why she couldn't come."

"I know… I just miss her, it's been so long…"

Yi Chunshan fell silent for a moment.

He missed her too.

After the New Year, the elderly couple had bought a villa in the same residential community in the neighboring city.

They signed the purchase contract and moved in swiftly.

When Yi Min returned from Hong Kong, she was startled to find her parents had become her neighbors.

But she was genuinely happy.

The old couple could see their daughter and son-in-law every day.

Yet they didn't live under the same roof.

It gave everyone their own space.

They had lived like this for two months.

Not long ago, the old master had to chair a board meeting, so he returned to the capital from the neighboring city.

After returning, neither of the old couple had been idle.

Yi Chunshan was busy with work.

Florence Atlante tended to the garden and puttered in the vegetable patch.

On top of that, she called Sophia Sullivan to come over for meals.

…

Another Saturday arrived in the blink of an eye.

Sophia had worked in the lab until midnight last night.

She simply stayed over.

There was a bed, bedding, toiletries, and a change of clothes.

She slept until eight in the morning.

Got up and had breakfast.

Changed into her lab coat. It was just half past eight.

The second set of model data had finished running.

Perfect timing to pick up where she left off last night.

"Good morning, Sophia~"

At nine, Hannah and Marcus Lawrence arrived.

"Morning." Sophia briefly glanced away from her screen.

Marcus noticed something immediately.

"Sophia, did you pull an all-nighter?"

"All-nighter?!" Hannah's eyes widened.

Sophia shook her head.

"No. I went to bed at three."

Marcus & Hannah fell silent.

What was the difference?

Hannah let out a mournful cry.

"Sophia, you're so brilliant and still work so hard. I feel a bit ashamed…"

First Sophia, then Caleb.

Caleb had returned to school half a month ago.

All matters at home were settled.

With no more worries holding him back.

He decided to go for his Ph.D.!

Hannah was stunned on the spot.

But after a moment's thought, it made perfect sense.

Before, he had carried such a heavy burden for his family.

On top of that, he faced exploitation from Professor Victoria Lowell.

Forced to be Ashley's ghostwriter.

Even then, Caleb managed his studies well and maintained a steady academic output.

Now, freed from these constraints.

It was like a fish returned to the sea, a dragon soaring through the heavens.

Pursuing a Ph.D. seemed only natural.

Sophia was already intense enough.

Now there was Caleb too.

It was simply leaving no room for others to breathe.

Hannah felt her scalp prickle.

Now, if she slacked off even a little, she felt guilty.

She had to muster every ounce of focus for her research.

If her progress fell behind, it would hold back the entire project.

Even though Sophia often comforted her with "no rush," "take your time," "I'll handle the rest."

Hannah knew better.

How could she really hand her part over for someone else to do?

Once or twice was fine.

But if it became a habit.

Eventually, it would be Sophia dragging her along.

Hannah wasn't stupid.

She knew clearly that once the gap between people widened, it might become impossible to catch up.

If you can't catch up, how can you walk together?

In the end, you can only "break up."

Marcus quickly noticed Hannah had become more proactive lately.

Her whole demeanor was more serious.

Before, in the lab, she couldn't help but joke and laugh.

But recently, she seemed to chat much less.

She arrived, changed into her lab coat, and went straight to the bench.

She would stay there for half the day.

Lunch was rushed.

Hannah sighed.

"You don't get it."

Marcus was puzzled.

"The pressure is too much! Waaa—"

"Then, what should we do?" Seeing tears welling in Hannah's eyes, he panicked.

"I'm not getting enough sleep… Can we cut the morning run short by ten minutes? Waaa…"

Marcus nodded.

"Okay."

Hannah was taken aback.

That easy?

Should she have asked for more?

Marcus saw right through her little scheme.

"Not a minute more."

Fine.

The tears in Hannah's eyes weren't fake.

She really did feel like crying.

The pressure was real.

Not getting enough sleep was also real.

But she only felt that moment of collapse.

She quickly adjusted her emotions.

"Work, work!"

By evening, Hannah had finished her tasks.

She stretched on the spot, letting out a long breath.

It was half an hour earlier than she had estimated.

She was very satisfied.

"Marcus, are you done over there?"

"Almost."

Hannah's eyes lit up.

"Shall we go into the city to watch a movie later?"

Marcus was stunned, his head snapping up.

She was asking him to a movie?

His heartbeat quickened uncontrollably.

When he didn't answer, Hannah asked again.

"Want to go?"

Marcus nodded.

"Yes!"

Hannah smiled and turned to invite Sophia.

"Sophia, a new comedy came out yesterday, the reviews are pretty good. Want to go watch it with us?"

Marcus fell silent.

So it wasn't just an invitation for him.

Sophia waved her hand.

"I still have a while to go here, I won't join you. Have fun."

Hannah hadn't really expected to successfully invite her anyway.

She wasn't disappointed.

She remained cheerful.

"Alright. Is there anything you'd like to eat? I can drive it over after the movie."

"No need. I'll leave once I'm done here. It won't be too long. No point in you making another trip; it would waste too much time."

"Okay then. Don't overwork yourself!"

"Mhmm~"

After Hannah and Marcus left, Sophia stayed another half hour before finishing.

She changed out of her lab coat, locked up, and left.

She had driven today.

The traffic was smooth all the way.

After parking, she took the elevator from the garage directly to the first-floor supermarket.

Some household supplies were running low at home.

She could also buy some groceries to make a simple dinner.

She finished selecting her items, checked out, and emerged from the supermarket half an hour later.

Just as she reached the entrance of her building, she ran into Alexander Laurent returning from his evening run.

"Let me." The man naturally took the shopping bags from her. "Back from the lab?"

"Yes." Sophia nodded, not standing on ceremony.

They went upstairs together.

Midway, Sophia suddenly called out to him.

"Professor."

"Hmm?" Alexander turned his head. "What is it?"

"The verdict for the two Croix brothers is out. Assault, disorderly conduct, human trafficking, group drug use… Multiple charges. One got 18 years, the other 15."

"I know."

"Besides that, the Croix family is also being investigated. Vincent Croix and other relevant people are detained. Minor figures like Marco and Mr. Quincy weren't spared either. I heard it was a joint operation between two provinces, a key execution of the anti-gang crime special campaign."

Sophia had seen this in the news this morning.

Alexander's tone was calm.

"The villains finally got their punishment. The Watson family won't have to live in fear from now on."

"No," Sophia looked up, meeting his gaze directly. "What I want to ask is—"

Alexander looked puzzled.

Sophia enunciated each word clearly.

"Was it you?"
###Chapter 467

Alexander Laurent was different.

The man froze.

Then he chuckled softly. "Why do you ask?"

Sophia Sullivan looked at him intently. "I think it was you. So, was it?"

After a moment of silence, Alexander nodded. "Yes."

A smile touched Sophia's lips. "I knew it... No wonder you said to let things play out. You had it all planned?"

"I considered it, but wasn't sure it would work."

That's why he hadn't mentioned it beforehand.

He didn't want to raise hopes for something uncertain, only to cause disappointment.

"I have a question for you too," Alexander said.

Sophia blinked. "What is it?"

"Why were you so sure it was me, and not Sebastian Evans? Did you ask him?"

"No. I only asked you."

"Then why were you certain?"

Sophia paused. They had reached her doorstep.

"Because—" She met his gaze directly, her words clear. "I believe you could see the hardship the Watson family faced. You could sense the village's backwardness. You couldn't bear to just stand by."

Sebastian had seen it too. He had told Caleb what to do.

But he stopped at giving advice. He didn't intend to interfere with someone else's fate.

In his view, it was their path to walk, not his to alter.

Alexander was different.

He saw, he knew what needed to be done, and he understood Caleb couldn't achieve it alone.

So Sophia had helped Caleb with the money, but changing the reality of Lower Dam Village was beyond her power.

"The news also mentioned government plans to build roads and develop agricultural side industries... Was that your suggestion too?"

Alexander nodded. "In a way. Is it... acceptable?"

Sophia laughed. "It's more than acceptable! It's perfect!"

The man rubbed the back of his neck, slightly embarrassed.

"Professor, have you had dinner?"

Alexander replied, "Yes, I have."

"Then how about some late-night snacks?"

His eyes lit up. "Is this... an invitation?"

"If you think it is, then it is." Sophia took the shopping bag from him and turned to open the door.

Alexander followed her inside, expertly changing his shoes. "Well, I can't refuse such hospitality. Don't mind if I do."

They cooked together again, ate together, cleaned up together.

As he was leaving, Alexander asked, "Are you going to the lab tomorrow?"

Sophia nodded. "Yes."

"Shall we leave together then?"

"Okay."

The next day, Sophia got up early to make soy milk and fry some dough sticks.

She handed a portion to Alexander at the door. "Breakfast."

"Thank you."

They walked to the garage to get their cars.

Alexander said, "I have a meeting at the main auditorium today. It's near the eastern suburbs. Would you like to have lunch together?"

Sophia agreed. "Sure."

...

It was Sunday. Neither Hannah Morse nor Marcus Lawrence had come in.

Sophia changed into her lab coat and started working.

When she looked up again, it was already eleven.

She stretched her stiff neck and went to get some water.

Her phone rang abruptly.

"Hello? Grandma."

"Clara, it's Sunday! Don't forget to come for lunch. The food is almost ready!"

"!!"

"Clara? Are you there? Is the signal bad...?"

"Grandma, I'm here," she responded quickly. "Lunch..."

"Yes, have you left yet? Should I ask A-Yan to pick you up?"

"N-No need..."

Heavens! She had completely forgotten!

Last week, the old lady had called about lunch. Sophia, busy testing a model, had casually said, "I'm busy this week."

The old lady immediately suggested, "Next week is fine too."

Sophia thought she wouldn't be busy next week and realized it had been a while since she visited them, so she agreed.

And then...

She forgot all about it!

"Grandma, I—"

"Old man, watch the stove for me. It's been stewing for three hours, just needs reducing. It's noisy in here, I'll go outside to talk to Clara..."

The old lady moved to the living room. The range hood noise faded.

"Clara, can you hear me now? What were you saying?"

"Nothing... I'll be there on time. Sorry for making you cook so much."

"No trouble at all! No trouble!" The old lady happily hung up.

Sophia put down her phone and immediately called Alexander. It was still early; he probably... hadn't left yet?

The phone rang twice before Alexander answered.

"Sophia?"

"Professor Laurent, I'm so sorry, today I might—"

Before she could finish, her tablet chimed with a permission request. The screen showed the feed from the camera outside her door.

Who else could it be but Alexander?

"Sophia, I'm outside. Did you get the entry request?"

Sophia: "..." He was here already?!

Alexander came in and noticed Sophia wasn't in the lab area. Her workstation was tidy.

"Professor, I'm sorry..."

"What's wrong? Why the sudden apology?" He looked surprised.

"I forgot I promised Grandma I'd go home for lunch today... I'm so sorry to cancel on you. I was just calling to tell you, but I didn't expect..."

Alexander was taken aback, then understood. "That's all? It's nothing to apologize so seriously for... Go spend time with your grandmother. I can manage lunch on my own."

Thinking he had declined a colleague's invitation specifically to have lunch with her, and now she was backing out, Sophia felt terribly guilty.

"Professor, why don't you come with me to my grandparents' for lunch?"

The old couple knew Alexander and thought highly of him. They would likely welcome him.

"Would that... be appropriate?"

A family meal... Was it right for an outsider to be there?

The more Sophia thought about it, the better the idea seemed. It solved both problems. "It's settled then!"

Alexander said, "Then... I'll accompany you to visit them. It has been a while."

As they were preparing to leave, they ran into Caleb Watson emerging from the break room.

Or rather, floating out.

His steps were soundless. Dark circles hung under his eyes. He looked utterly drained, yawning as he walked.

Seeing Sophia and Alexander, he froze for a second.

Then, snapping to attention, he hurriedly greeted them. "Sophia, Professor Laurent, you're here?"

Alexander gave a slight nod.

Sophia stared at him, her gaze scrutinizing.

Caleb scratched his head. "Well... I'll get to the lab then."

Watching his unsteady gait, Sophia's frown deepened. "Did you pull another all-nighter last night?"

Caleb: "..."

Just as she thought!

Sophia was genuinely angry now. "You were up late the night before last, and another all-nighter last night. Have you even slept four hours total? Are you doing research or trying to kill yourself?"

Caleb was stunned by the scolding, rooted to the spot like a confused goose.

He used to work at this intensity all the time. No one had ever said anything.

No one had ever gotten angry with him over how few hours he slept.

Along with the discomfort and strangeness, a warmth and gratitude he'd never felt before bloomed in his chest.

"Sophia..."

"Don't say another word. Go get ready. You're coming home with me for lunch."

Caleb: "?!"
###Chapter 468
Sophia Sullivan decided she had to get Caleb Watson out of the lab.

Otherwise, he would stay until tomorrow morning.

He had already been up for two days.

Only sleeping a little.

Not eating anything.

Getting up to continue working.

Did he think he was made of iron?

Sophia felt a chill run down her spine.

She knew Caleb was driven.

She just didn't realize he was this driven.

It was like he was gambling with his life.

"What are you spacing out for? Pack up and come out. I'll wait for you at the entrance."

After saying this, she took Alexander Laurent and left.

Caleb stood where he was.

Stunned.

Dinner?

At her house?

He was packed and out in five minutes.

He had only washed his face.

Changed out of his lab coat.

His hair was a mess.

But his handsome face carried it.

The messy hair looked like an intentional style.

Caleb sat dazedly in Sophia's passenger seat.

Alexander raised an eyebrow.

He opened the car door himself.

It dawned on Caleb belatedly: Should he have ridden with the professor?

Thirty minutes later.

The car stopped.

Caleb had almost fallen asleep.

He followed Sophia inside, still half-asleep.

Then he jolted awake, all sleepiness gone.

The house was enormous.

Exquisitely decorated.

With a large garden.

In the distance, there were vegetable plots and greenhouses.

"Sophia, I thought we were having dinner?"

This felt more like a high-end farm stay.

An elderly lady came out with a warm smile.

"Clara, you're here!"

Her gaze fell on Caleb.

Sophia introduced them.

Caleb shyly greeted her. "Hello, Grandma. Sorry for the intrusion."

He suddenly realized he hadn't brought a gift.

How rude.

"Hello, hello, no intrusion at all," the elderly lady greeted him warmly.

She fetched slippers.

Took their coats.

Alexander and Caleb handled their own.

Caleb asked if there were shoe covers.

The elderly lady immediately explained the slippers were new.

Caleb felt awkward.

In his experience, slippers were for family.

Guests should use shoe covers.

The elderly lady didn't mind.

She urged him to change.

"Help yourself to fruit and snacks, don't be shy!"

"Okay, thank you."

"You all sit, I'll go to the kitchen. Dinner will be ready soon."

The elderly lady had gone to an import supermarket early that morning.

She bought plenty of fresh ingredients.

Her husband joked she was trying to empty the store.

The food was served.

The elderly couple invited everyone to the table.

A housekeeper went to the study to get Sebastian Evans.

Sebastian had just finished a cross-border meeting.

His mind had already wandered.

He wanted to go downstairs when he heard the car engine.

The housekeeper came to get him.

He walked out of the study with a smile.

Knowing Sophia was coming today.

He had specifically stayed home.

Just to wait for her.

Walking into the dining room.

He saw Sophia.

He also saw Alexander and Caleb.

His smile froze.

The corners of his mouth flattened.

"Professor Laurent, you're here too?"

Alexander looked up with an amused smile. "Sophia invited me. Hard to refuse such a kind offer. And to visit you both."

"Sophia invited" pierced Sebastian's heart.

It hurt.

Florence Atlante: "A-Yan, sit, let's eat."

"...Okay."

Sophia sat with the elderly lady on her left and Alexander on her right.

Only the seat opposite was left.

Sebastian sat down.

The elderly lady piled food onto Caleb's plate.

It became a small mountain.

He had to eat it.

He couldn't refuse her kindness.

Alexander was smarter.

He picked up the serving chopsticks and put food on the elderly lady's plate.

His reverse move worked.

The elderly lady was busy eating.

She couldn't pile on more.

Sophia gave a silent thumbs-up.

Physicists really are clever.

After dinner.

The elderly lady took everyone to the strawberry garden.

The greenhouse was full of strawberries.

It was peak season.

"They're growing so well! Big and red, no pesticides, clean and fresh."

"Everyone take a basket, pick as much as you want, take some home."

"Put some in the lab too, you have a fridge."

They entered the greenhouse.

It was a sea of red berries.

"If we don't pick them, they'll spoil in a couple of days."

Sophia picked one, washed it.

Put it in her mouth.

A sweet, creamy strawberry flavor.

"Mmm! Delicious!"

The elderly lady was as happy as a child.

It was Caleb's first time seeing a private strawberry garden.

The ones in his village were small and tart.

He'd only seen these large, premium strawberries in supermarkets.

Sophia gave Alexander and Sebastian each a basket.

She took one for herself.

She started picking diligently.

Thinking how happy Hannah would be to see them.

She'd pick a lot to take back to the lab.

Alexander: "Let me help you."

Sebastian joined in. "You can have the ones I pick."

Sophia looked at them. "You two don't like strawberries?"

Alexander: "..."

Sebastian: "..."

Sophia washed a strawberry and handed it to Alexander, who was closest.

"Professor, try it. It's very sweet."

"Okay." The man took it and took a bite. "It is sweet."

"My selection was good."

"Why give it to him and not me?" Sebastian approached and said quietly.

Sophia: "Here, you try one too."

Alexander smiled. "How is it, Sebastian?"

Sebastian: "Sour."

After saying that, he picked up his basket and walked away.
###Chapter 469

Another Butterfly Flutters In!

Alexander Laurent thought this was incredibly childish.

Sophia Sullivan frowned.

That couldn't be right.

She had picked each one carefully. They all looked sweet.

Perhaps… he was just unlucky and got the sour one.

Alexander Laurent and Sebastian Evans picked two full baskets and handed them to Sophia.

After everything was bagged and packed, the three began walking back.

They spotted Florence Atlante and Caleb Watson crouched by the edge of the field, speaking in low tones.

As they got closer, they saw Caleb loosening the soil with a small hoe.

He worked as he explained.

"Strawberries aren't overly picky about soil, but it's best to choose fertile, loose, well-draining sandy loam."

"A pH between 5.5 and 6.5 is ideal."

"This soil is actually not bad. It just drains a bit worse than sandy loam."

"No wonder so many roots rotted before," the old lady said, suddenly understanding.

"The seller swore it was sandy loam when I bought it. He actually dared to cheat an old woman!"

"Mr. Watson, have you grown strawberries before? You know so much."

"My family didn't, but our neighbors did. I borrowed his books to read."

"I see… You handle the hoe so skillfully. Do you often help out at home?"

"Yes. My mother's health isn't good. My father works alone."

"I have to lend a hand with the spring planting and autumn harvest."

"What a good child…"

Florence had sensed Caleb came from a modest background the moment he arrived.

Hearing this and seeing the thick calluses on his fingers, she couldn't help but sigh inwardly.

Just then, a servant came to deliver a message.

A guest had arrived.

The old lady was surprised. "Who?"

"It seems to be the young master of the Shaw Family."

The Shaw Family?

Florence frowned.

The two families were on good terms. The entire Shaw Family had come for the old master's birthday banquet.

This young master Omelas had even been introduced to the old couple by his father.

Why was he visiting so suddenly?

"Is he alone?"

The servant nodded. "Yes."

"Let Isaac handle it. I won't go."

"Sir is in his study having a video conference. He gave orders not to be disturbed."

"The steward sent me to find you and Young Master Evans."

"I see… Then I'll go meet him."

In the living room—

Ling Shuo Omelas sat on the sofa.

A servant respectfully offered him hot tea.

He politely accepted it, took a sip, and gently placed it back on the coffee table.

His manners were impeccable, without a hint of arrogance.

His eyes wandered curiously around the room as if searching for something.

Seeing Florence enter, he immediately stood up. "Grandma Yi—"

"Ling Shuo! What a rare guest! Please, sit, sit! Make yourself at home!"

"Alright."

"Is there… something you needed today?"

"My grandfather's ninetieth birthday is on the sixth of next month. This is the invitation."

Florence took it with a smile. "Congratulations, congratulations. We will certainly attend Old Master Omelas's joyous occasion."

"It's too kind of you to deliver such a small matter personally."

"The Yi and Omelas families have been friends for decades. Grandfather said it must be delivered personally to show sincerity."

"That's very thoughtful."

Ling Shuo Omelas glanced around. "Are you the only one home? Is Miss Sullivan not here?"

The old lady didn't think much of it. "Sophia is here today."

"Then she…"

Ling Shuo Omelas quickly explained. "My cousin is preparing for her MIT entrance exams."

"I heard Miss Sullivan is a graduate student at MIT, and she got in on her own merits."

"My cousin asked me to see if Miss Sullivan had any exam preparation tips she could share."

"I see… I'll have a servant fetch her. Please wait a moment."

"Alright."

Soon, Sophia Sullivan entered the room.

"Grandmother, you asked for me?"

"Sophia, this is the young master of the Shaw Family, Ling Shuo Omelas. You probably met at the birthday banquet."

"Hello." Sophia took the initiative to greet him.

She had a slight impression of him.

This young master Omelas had performed a magic trick for the old master that night.

He used an apple to produce two large characters for "Longevity."

One for the old master, and one for the old lady.

This gesture…

He had certainly put thought into it.

"Hello!" Ling Shuo Omelas shot to his feet the moment she entered.

His expression was a mix of anticipation and nervousness. He seemed unsure what to do with his hands and feet.

Hearing Sophia speak first, his breathing even sounded flustered.

The old lady interjected at the right moment. "Ling Shuo has something he'd like to ask you."

Sophia looked at him.

Ling Shuo Omelas stated his purpose. "...Would it be possible to add you on WhatsApp?"

"I could introduce you to her, to make communication easier."

"Don't worry, my cousin is very sensible. She won't bother you constantly."

Put on the spot like this, Sophia had no choice but to take out her phone.

After adding her as a friend, Ling Shuo Omelas immediately forwarded Sophia's contact to his cousin.

Soon, a friend request from the cousin came through.

It really did seem like he added her for his cousin's sake.

Sophia didn't overthink it. "I'm in the lab most of the time."

"When I'm busy, I don't look at my phone for long periods. My replies might not be timely."

"It's fine, it's fine! Just reply to her whenever you have time."

"That lab… is it the university's?"

Sophia said, "No."

The conversation naturally turned to the Aetheria Lab, how the lab came to be…

His questions came one after another.

Out of politeness, Sophia answered them one by one.

Meanwhile, Alexander Laurent and Sebastian Evans, noticing her prolonged absence, grew restless.

They came over from the strawberry field together.

Caleb, seeing this, quickly followed.

Who knew that upon entering, they would see "a butterfly" fluttering around Sophia.

Sebastian Evans was inwardly furious.

Another one?!

Was there no end to this?!

Alexander Laurent's eyes darkened.

They both looked at Ling Shuo Omelas.

The man, who had been staring intently at Sophia, sensed their gaze.

That kind of stare was too intense to ignore.

He turned and first met Sebastian Evans's death glare.

Then he plunged into the depths of Alexander Laurent's dark, profound gaze.

Ling Shuo Omelas's breath hitched. A chill ran down his spine.

Caleb, who entered last, shivered abruptly.

Why… why did it suddenly feel a bit cold?

He swallowed hard with difficulty, stopped walking, and quietly retreated a few steps.

"Heh…" Sebastian Evans suddenly chuckled lightly, breaking the strange atmosphere.

"Young Master Omelas, what a rare guest. Do you have so much to talk about with Sophia?"

Ling Shuo Omelas choked. "I-I just asked some questions."

"Oh? Does Young Master Omelas also understand scientific research?"

"..."

"Also involved in academia? Writing papers?"

"..."

Ling Shuo Omelas forced a dry laugh. "Well… no."

"Oh, I forgot. You graduated long ago. You've started taking over the family business now, right?"

"...Yes."

"Our Sophia doesn't understand business. Please don't ask irrelevant questions. It would save everyone's time. Don't you think?"

Ling Shuo Omelas frowned.

He looked at Sebastian Evans with confusion, seemingly unable to understand why he was being targeted.

He didn't think he had offended him, did he?
###Chapter 470

Then he remembered.
This was Sophia's brother.
It made sense that he saw through his intentions and was annoyed.
Brothers protect their sisters.
He quickly put on a smile. "You're right, Sebastian. I've delivered the invitation. I won't disturb you further."
Zachary Wang took his leave politely.
The grandmother saw him to the door.
Caleb Watson also prepared to leave. "Thank you for your hospitality, Grandma. The food was delicious, and the strawberries were very sweet. I should head back now."
"Won't you stay for dinner?"
"No, no," Caleb waved his hands quickly. "I have things to do."
"Alright. Come visit often."
"Okay."
Caleb turned to put on his shoes.
Sophia instructed the driver. "Uncle Moore, please see him out."
Caleb said, "That's not necessary. I can get back to the lab myself."
"Who said anything about the lab?"
"Huh?"
"Uncle Moore, take him to the MIT gate. Make sure he goes inside."
Back to the lab?
Another all-nighter?
Not a chance.
Caleb surrendered.
He trudged out dejectedly and got into the car.
Sebastian watched Caleb comply, then his eyes fell on Alexander Laurent still standing there. He found him increasingly irritating.
"Professor Laurent, not busy lately?"
The dismissal was clear.
Alexander acted oblivious. He nodded. "The project's wrapped up. Not busy at all."
"..."
"It's getting late. So you...?" Sebastian checked his watch.
Alexander played along. "Alright. I'll head back. There are leftovers in the fridge. Just heat them up. Grandma, thank you for today. Take care during the season change. I'll visit again soon."
"Absolutely not!" Florence Atlante refused to let him leave. "Leftovers? We have fresh, hot food right here!"
"But..." Alexander feigned hesitation.
"No buts! It's decided. You're staying for dinner!"
"Well... alright then."
"Good!" The old lady beamed.
Sebastian: "..."
'Leftovers in the fridge heat up just fine' indeed!
He was doing this on purpose!
Alexander spread his hands and shrugged at Sebastian. Grandma insisted. What could I do?
Sebastian's jaw tightened.
His murderous intent was barely concealed.
Isaac Atlante emerged from the study.
"I heard the Shaw Family sent someone?"
The old lady nodded. "Young master Zachary delivered the invitation personally. His family's patriarch is celebrating his birthday next month."
"Thought it was something major. Secretaries or assistants can handle these things. No need for a personal visit."
Florence said, "I thought so too, but the child said it showed sincerity."
Isaac nodded, satisfied.
"Alexander, do you have time?"
"I do. What do you need, Grandfather?"
"Hahaha... nothing needing, nothing needing. Come, play a few games of Go with me."
"Alright."
The old and the young sat down and began placing stones.
Sophia stood watching for less than ten minutes before she started yawning.
Forget it. A nap sounds better.
Sebastian also had work to handle and went upstairs with her.
"Sophia—"
Sebastian spoke just before she entered her room.
Sophia paused and turned. "What is it, Sebastian?"
That one word, "Sebastian," lodged everything he wanted to say in his throat.
After a long moment, he spoke again. "Nothing. If the blankets are too thin, just say the word. Ask the maid to change them."
"Okay."

...

Sophia woke up two hours later.
She went downstairs and found Isaac and Alexander exactly as before, sitting opposite each other, holding stones, deep in thought.
She wondered if she'd even slept.
"Sophia's up? Come help me take a look!" The old man waved her over. "This Alexander is something else! He's beaten me twice already!"
Alexander chuckled. "You've won against me too, haven't you?"
"Not as many times as you've won!"
Sophia walked over, smiling. "I'm not very good. I only know the basics."
The old man said, "Some things are clearer to an outside perspective! Sophia, take a look at this group for me. Any way to break out?"
"Let me see..."
Sophia studied the board carefully.
"Actually, this group can—"
"Sophia," Alexander interrupted her. "Spectators don't speak."
She immediately fell silent, giving the old man an apologetic smile. See, it's not that I won't help.
Isaac: "??"
This Alexander!
Couldn't he let an old man win?
But...
Isaac loved playing against someone this serious.
What was the point of letting him win?
It was just patronizing!
Soon, the situation on the board became clear. Alexander advanced triumphantly.
Isaac surrendered his stones with a sigh. "I lose. Alexander, your skills are impressive!"
"You flatter me."
Sebastian came downstairs. "How about I play a game with Professor Laurent?"
Alexander raised an eyebrow. "...It would be an honor."
Their eyes met. The atmosphere instantly grew tense.
Isaac gave up his seat. Sebastian sat down.
Alexander asked, "Black or white?"
Black moves first, holding the advantage.
Sebastian casually picked up the white stones in front of him. "This is fine. No need to trouble with switching."
The old man had played white last. Sebastian sat in his seat, so white stones were naturally at hand.
This Alexander had to ask. Hah...
Who did he think he was looking down on?
First game. Sebastian wasn't warmed up. Alexander won quickly.
The second game lasted longer. Sebastian seized an opportunity, employed a "relieve the besieged by besieging the base of the besiegers" tactic, and successfully evened the score.
Third game. The decider.
Neither acted rashly anymore. From the first move, they laid out their strategies cautiously.
The old lady watched for a while, couldn't sit still any longer, and went into the kitchen to busy herself.
The old man and Sophia stood watching, utterly fascinated.
Especially Isaac. As the game progressed, with every move, his expression grew more serious.
Anyone watching would think he was the one playing.
Sebastian executed a "bolt the door and beat the dog" move, capturing a group of Alexander's black stones.
The old man exclaimed, "Oh no!" and slapped his thigh. "Alexander, you got careless!"
His tone was full of regret.
Alexander remained calm. He placed a stone. Sebastian's formation in the upper left corner instantly collapsed.
"Eh? Eh? That works?!" The old man was astonished. "An immediate reversal! Light after darkness!"
But Sophia shook her head. "No. The Professor's previous move was probably intentional. Lure the enemy in deep, then annihilate them in one fell swoop."
"Ah— You're right!"
They went back and forth, chasing, biting, the situation deadlocked.
No one knew how much time passed. The game still wasn't over.
The old lady peeked out from the kitchen several times, muttering under her breath. "What game never ends? Are we eating or not?"
Finally—
"Triple ko?!" Isaac exclaimed in surprise.
Alexander and Sebastian locked eyes.
It was like blades clashing, ringing with fury.
Alexander Laurent tapped the chessboard lightly with his fingertips.
"Impressive game, Mr. Evans."

Sebastian Evans glanced up coolly.
###Chapter 471

"Flattery? Praising me is just praising yourself. I didn't expect Professor Laurent to be so narcissistic."

He rose and walked toward the dining room.

Alexander Laurent fell silent.

Florence Atlante let out a long sigh.
"Finally finished! Let's eat, the food is getting cold! Sophia, Alexander—"

"Coming!"

The old man remained standing, staring at Sebastian's retreating back, his brow furrowed.

Sebastian was acting very strange today.

He never played Go normally, yet today he not only played but did so with a fierce and aggressive style.

It was as if he had some grudge against Alexander.

As the old man pondered, Florence called out impatiently.
"What are you daydreaming about? The young ones are already at the table, waiting for you to start!"

"Oh…"

After dinner, Alexander chatted with the elderly couple for a while.

Seeing it was getting late, he stood to leave.

Sophia Sullivan also rose.
"I'm heading the same way as the Professor. I'll go with him."

Alexander nodded.
"Alright."

The old man and his wife saw them to the door.

Sebastian stood at the top of the staircase, watching coldly.

They both drove here. What same way?

The old woman turned and caught the undisguised hostility in his eyes before he could hide it.

"Sebastian…"

"Yes, Grandma?"

"Do you… have some issue with Alexander?"

She had heard Sebastian's thinly veiled suggestion for Alexander to leave at noon.

"No issue," Sebastian said without changing expression.

"Then why are you targeting him?"

"I just don't like the look of him."

Florence was curious.
"I think Alexander is quite nice. Polite, considerate, sincere, and well-spoken. What exactly don't you like about him?"

"Exactly those things you just mentioned."

Florence was puzzled.
"?"

Sebastian said no more and turned to go upstairs.

"That child…" The old woman shook her head helplessly.

…

At the end of May, "Academic Perspectives" Issue 321 released the "National Key Laboratory Rankings."

The list was based on a comprehensive score of domestic laboratories' academic output volume and impact factors from the previous year.

It was published annually.

This year's biggest dark horse was the "Boundless Laboratory"!

Even though it only ranked 92nd.

It had made the list.

Across the entire MIT, with its 6 divisions, 49 directly affiliated departments, 128 undergraduate majors, 285 master's programs, and 262 doctoral programs, only 17 laboratories made the list.

Most of these labs were guided by Academicians, with research teams composed of PhDs and postdocs.

Labs like Sophia Sullivan's, with Hannah Morse, Marcus Lawrence, and Caleb Watson—a fourth-year PhD student yet to graduate—had no Academician guidance and should have gone unnoticed.

They shouldn't have even garnered attention, let alone made the list.

The university administration was equally perplexed.

In the President's office—

Xiao Ninghan flipped through "Academic Perspectives," his fingers trembling slightly.

After serial number "92," the words "Boundless Laboratory" were printed clearly.

"How is this possible?" The Vice President was equally shocked.

Xiao Ninghan suddenly thought of something.
"Check how many domestic scholars published in Nature Biotechnology last year."

The Vice President immediately opened his computer.

Five minutes later—

"Last year, domestic scholars published a total of... 6 papers in Nature Biotechnology."

Sophia Sullivan's team alone accounted for 2 of them, one-third of the country's total output.

"So that's how it is…" Xiao Ninghan sighed softly.

The Vice President's mind began to race.
"This year's International Academic Exchange Conference…"

Xiao Ninghan shook his head.
"It's too late…"

The conference opened on June 4th, less than 10 days away. Changing participants now was unrealistic.

"Next year. We'll send Sophia Sullivan's team next year."

Xiao Ninghan smiled wryly.
"Last time, when the Academic Affairs Office put up the honor roll and the official website published promotional articles, did you see those kids buying into it?"

The Vice President rubbed his nose.
"That was just a gesture of goodwill. We didn't expect them to actually buy into it…"

"Those kids have tempers, and even more rebelliousness. The university didn't participate in the departmental conflicts before, but inaction was tantamount to endorsement."

"If we had handled the fire safety inspection incident promptly, we wouldn't have fallen out with Sophia Sullivan and the others…"

But we didn't.

The university chose to make a big deal out of it initially, then let it fade away.

Xiao Ninghan changed the subject.
"This International Academic Exchange Conference might not be a loss. Our preliminary preparations were very thorough."

The Vice President sighed.
"Let's hope so."

…

The most excited was Hannah!

"We made the list! National Key Laboratory! I need to call my dad! The Morse family ancestors are smiling!"

Marcus Lawrence kept his voice low.
"Keep it down! Keep it down!"

"Oh right! Class is about to start... but Marcus, how are you so calm?"

Marcus, whose fingers were trembling under the desk.
"..." Calm?

"Sophia is amazing. She led both those Nature Biotechnology papers. I wonder when I'll be able to design experiments independently…"

A light shone in Marcus's eyes.
"You will. We're just moving a bit slower, but we're on the right path."

That was better than many lost graduate students.

Ding—

The class bell rang.

They both quieted down.

Hannah suddenly remembered something and looked sharply at Marcus.
"Where's Sophia?"

It was a specialized course today. All three of them usually attended.

She hadn't mentioned taking leave either.

Marcus shook his head.
"Not sure. Want to call her?"

"Okay."

After the dial tone—

"The number is temporarily unreachable? What's going on?"

The teacher walked up to the podium—

"Class, Professor Laurent is on leave today. I'll be substituting. Please look at the PPT…"
###Chapter 472

The substitute teacher was unfamiliar.

He was slightly balding and around forty years old.

His teaching consisted of mechanically reading from the PowerPoint.

The class was dull and lifeless.

The students began to lose focus.

"Where's Professor Laurent?" Hannah Morse whispered to Marcus Lawrence.

Marcus shook his head. "If you don't know, how would I?"

Hannah shot him an exasperated look.

Marcus looked down at his phone. "I sent a message to Sophia…"

"Did she reply?"

"Not yet."

Hannah completely gave up on talking.

At that moment, Sophia Sullivan was on a flight to Shanghai with Professor Eleanor Watson.

Their plane landed at Pudong Airport at two in the afternoon.

A private car picked them up, and they arrived at The Peninsula Hotel fifty minutes later.

A large display board stood at the hotel entrance.

It read: "The 13th National Interdisciplinary Academic Summit Forum."

Staff guided them through the VIP check-in channel.

Sophia was accompanying Professor Watson to the academic summit.

She hadn't had time to tell Hannah or Marcus.

She had woken up to a call from her professor, telling her to pack her bags and head to the airport.

She only learned their destination after boarding.

During the trip, she had to take care of herself while also constantly watching over Professor Watson.

The elderly woman had been hospitalized last month and hadn't fully recovered.

This summit covered multiple interdisciplinary fields.

It wasn't just biology experts; scholars from other related disciplines were also attending.

Sophia could only attend thanks to Professor Watson's recommendation.

They finished checking in at the front desk and were heading to the elevators when they ran into someone familiar.

"Professor Watson! Sophia!" Alexander Laurent greeted them with a smile. "You're here too?"

Professor Watson was delighted to see him. "Alexander! I didn't expect you to arrive today."

The summit lasted three days. Day one for registration, day two for lectures, and day three for activities and a banquet.

Alexander smiled. "I came early to prepare."

"You're always so diligent." Professor Watson nodded approvingly.

A woman beside Alexander spoke up. "Hello, Professor Watson."

"And you are?" Professor Watson looked at her.

"I'm Lillian Lopez, a researcher in Professor Laurent's lab."

Professor Watson gave a slight nod.

Lillian turned to Sophia. "Sophia, you're here too?"

Sophia offered a polite smile. "We're heading up now. Don't let us keep you."

Alexander nodded in acknowledgment.

Lillian watched them leave, a smile on her face but a dark look in her eyes.

Sophia Sullivan got to attend a summit of this caliber?

Everyone here was a top scholar in their field, at least at the researcher level.

What could a mere graduate student possibly understand?

She was just here for the show.

"...Lillian, your ID."

Lillian snapped out of her thoughts and hurriedly searched for her identification.

Alexander had already gotten his room key and was walking toward the elevator.

He showed no intention of waiting for her.

She rushed through the check-in process and chased after him. "Professor! Wait for me!"

They went up to the seventh floor and entered their respective rooms.

Just before Alexander closed his door, Lillian suggested, "Professor, shall we have dinner together?"

Alexander checked the time. "I have an online meeting. Please go ahead without me."

The door closed softly.

Lillian stood rooted to the spot.

The door suddenly opened again.

Her eyes lit up.

"Professor…"

"Lillian, this is a rare opportunity. I hope you make the most of it."

Alexander closed the door again.

Lillian forced herself to maintain a smile.

Simon Lowell was supposed to come.

But something came up with his family last minute, and he recommended Lillian take his place.

Alexander wasn't aware of the specifics.

He had said what needed to be said.

…

Professor Watson hadn't fully recovered. Tired from the journey, she rested early.

Sophia helped her unpack and placed a glass of water by her bedside.

Then she quietly left the room.

Back in her own room, she took a shower and unpacked.

She made a cup of herbal tea and sat on the balcony rocking chair.

She admired the view while replying to messages.

She fell asleep without realizing it.

She woke up in the evening.

She first checked on Professor Watson. The elderly woman was sound asleep.

The water glass by the bed was half empty. Sophia refilled it.

She gently closed the door behind her as she left.

She ran into Alexander from across the hall.

They were both surprised.

"What a coincidence?" Alexander smiled.

Sophia pointed to the next room. "Professor Watson is in this one."

"Have you eaten?"

"I was just about to go."

"Let's go together. We can take a walk along the Bund afterward."

"Okay, let me just grab my bag."

Sophia went back to her room for her belongings.

She waited for the elevator with Alexander.

A familiar voice suddenly called out from behind them.

"Professor!"

They both turned around.
###Chapter 473

Lillian Lopez pushed the door open.

Alexander Laurent's tall, straight back came into view.

Her heart leaped with joy.

She was just about to call out to him.

But then, a face turned towards her from beside Alexander.

Sophia Sullivan.

Lillian's smile instantly faded by three degrees.

She quickened her pace and stepped to Alexander's other side.

"You're here too, Sophia." Her tone was distant.

Sophia detected the coolness in her voice.

She simply offered a faint smile and said nothing more.

Lillian turned to Alexander, her eyes hopeful. "Are you heading to dinner, Professor?"

"Yes."

"Perfect! I was just going too!"

The elevator lobby fell into silence.

Alexander did not respond.

Not even a polite invitation was offered.

Lillian seemed oblivious to this silent rejection.

She pressed further. "Professor, why don't we go together?"

Alexander replied, "Sorry, I have plans."

Two elevators arrived simultaneously.

Lillian stiffly entered the one on the right.

Alexander led Sophia into the left one.

The metal doors slid slowly shut.

The last thing visible was Lillian's contorted expression.

"Pfft—" Sophia couldn't hold back a laugh.

Alexander glanced at her. "What is it?"

"Professor, your rejection was way too obvious."

"Ahem…" The man cleared his throat lightly, masking his embarrassment.

The first floor housed several restaurants.

Sophia chose a Cantonese place.

"...Food bloggers all recommend this one. They say it's authentic old-school Cantonese. My treat?"

The conference provided a complimentary buffet.

But specialty restaurants required payment.

"Your choice is fine. I'll get this."

A server led them to a window seat.

It was still early, so the restaurant wasn't crowded.

The ambiance was elegant and quiet.

Sophia ordered a few signature dishes.

She handed the menu to Alexander. "Would you like to add anything, Professor?"

He took it. "Add an order of char siu and two bowls of lei cha."

"Lei cha?" Sophia blinked.

"Have you tried it before?"

"No."

"Try it later. It's a Hakka specialty."

The food arrived quickly.

Sophia couldn't wait to try the lei cha.

Her brow instantly furrowed.

She couldn't get used to it.

Not at all.

Alexander chuckled softly. "So impatient? Just like a child."

"Ahem—"

Sophia choked.

Who was a child?

The trendy restaurant's food was indeed good.

Sophia ate a fair amount of every dish.

Except for that bowl of lei cha.

Alexander seemed to like it quite a bit.

He not only finished his own bowl but also drank hers.

"Hey—" Sophia tried to stop him.

She wanted to say she'd taken a sip and they could order another.

But Alexander said, "No wasting."

Remembering she'd used a spoon and the bowl was still clean, she didn't stop him further.

When the bill came, Alexander paid first.

They walked out of the hotel.

The nightscape of the city was dazzlingly bustling and brilliant.

The iconic tower stood tall and majestic.

Sophia wore a knit sweater paired with a classic patterned shawl.

Dark jeans and nude flats.

She exuded a scholarly air.

Reserved and graceful.

Alexander was momentarily captivated.

Until—

"Professor? Professor!" Sophia called him.

He snapped back to attention. "...Sorry, what did you say just now?"

"Pfft—" Sophia couldn't help laughing.

"I said—is there something on my face? You were staring."

Alexander nodded seriously. "Yes."

"What?"

"Beauty."

"..."

Two seconds of silence.

"Ha ha ha ha ha... Professor, you tell dad jokes?"

"Ahem!"

It wasn't a joke.

It was the truth.

Alexander thought to himself silently.

They continued walking.

"Aren't you cold, dressed so lightly?"

Sophia: "Not cold, I have the shawl."

"It's so small, can it block the wind?"

"It can! It's perfectly enough!"

"...Alright. Tell me if you're cold. You can have my jacket."

"Okay."

Sophia walked to the front of the iconic tower.

She stood at the tourist photo spot and looked at Alexander.

Alexander understood. "Want a photo?"

Sophia's eyes lit up, and she nodded repeatedly.

No girl could resist a check-in photo.

Alexander took out his phone. "Ready?"

Sophia nodded.

"Three, two, one!"

In the photo, the girl stood before the railing.

In the distance were the glittering tower and countless city lights.

Up close, the wind tousled her hair.

With one hand, she smoothed her hair; with the other, she pulled the shawl tighter.

At the captured moment, she was just smiling towards the镜头 (lens).

Alexander took several shots in succession.

Different angles, different focal lengths.

Sophia walked over.

He handed her the phone. "See if they're okay."

Sophia hadn't held out much hope.

Straight men taking photos...

You know how it is.

But upon looking, she was amazed.

"Professor, did you study photography? These are too good!"

He'd even managed a bokeh background effect.

Every single one was beautiful.

"Send them all to me—"

Right now!

Alexander's smile was indulgent. "Okay."

He even knew to send the original files.

Sophia was deeply touched.

She immediately posted a nine-square grid of the beautiful photos on her social media.

Caption: The bustling night city~ lights twinkling~

Hannah Morse was the first to like it.

Comment: 【So beautiful! Slurp... slurp... screen-licking ing!】

Charlie Lowell: 【Come on, let's sing! The enchanting music plays again~ making me think of you~ Can't forget the dance of love~】

Professor Eleanor Watson: 【Out having fun? Don't worry about me, enjoy yourself, it's fine if you come back late哟 (yo)】

David Sullivan: 【My daughter is so pretty】

Isabella Sullivan: 【Went to the city?】

Olivia Lopez: 【Sweetie, I can't hold back, let me give you a kiss!】

Julian Winston replied to Olivia Lopez: 【...】

Alexander Laurent replied to Olivia Lopez: 【...】

Olivia Lopez replied to Alexander Laurent: 【Bro?】

Ethan Roscente: 【Very beautiful. Taken by a photographer?】

Sebastian Evans replied to Ethan Roscente: 【None of your business】

Ethan Roscente replied to Sebastian Evans: 【Oh, you took them? Cousin? [Smile]】

Marcus Lawrence silently gave a like.

The battlefield was chaotic, best not to jump in.
###Chapter 474

Sophia Sullivan put away her phone.

She didn't check the comments section.

It was getting late, so they headed back to the hotel.

Lillian Lopez stood in the lobby.

"Professor, Sophia."

Her smile was strained.

Her gaze fell on the two approaching side by side.

Alexander Laurent was elegant and scholarly.

Sophia Sullivan was strikingly beautiful.

They spoke in low tones, their rapport effortless.

Lillian's nails dug into her palms.

Alexander gave a slight nod.

Sophia offered only a faint curve of her lips.

They walked straight toward the elevators.

Lillian was left behind.

Her carefully planned 'chance' encounter had become a joke.

It was all Sophia's fault!

Lillian's eyes darkened.

Securing a spot at this summit hadn't been easy.

She had accompanied Simon Lowell on a trip to Lijiang.

She was the picture of gentle devotion, patient and attentive throughout.

Simon was deeply moved.

He even bought a diamond ring and proposed.

Lillian had intended to refuse.

But for the summit spot, she gave a vague acceptance.

While Simon was lost in visions of their future, she sighed softly.

"You attended the summit last year. I'm so envious."

Simon comforted her, saying there would be other opportunities.

Lillian lowered her eyes.

"Even if there is a chance, it won't be my turn. You and Dr. Zoe Langley are both ahead of me."

Simon was silent for a moment.

"I'll recommend you next year for sure."

Lillian looked up.

"Next year it might still be you. If I take your spot, would you really be okay with that?"

"You're my girlfriend. What's mine is yours. I'd be thrilled to see you succeed."

"Then let me have it this time, okay?"

The words slipped out before she could stop them.

Simon was stunned.

He studied her carefully.

Lillian regretted her haste.

"I'm sorry, that was selfish of me."

Simon quickly shook his head.

"No, Lillian, I understand. You just don't want to miss this opportunity."

He even made excuses for her.

Lillian seized the opening.

"Simon, only you understand me. I never used to care about ambition, but being with you... I've started to feel insecure..."

Simon was shocked.

Lillian felt insecure because of him?

A tremor of excitement ran through him.

This wasn't his one-sided fantasy.

Lillian loved him too!

"Okay," Simon said, taking her hand. "I'll help you get whatever you want."

The day after they returned to the city, Alexander notified Lillian to prepare for the summit.

Lillian didn't know how Simon managed it.

She only cared about the three days she would spend with Alexander.

For the past six months, Alexander had been deliberately keeping his distance.

In group settings, it was manageable.

But he always found a way to avoid being alone with her.

Lillian panicked.

If this continued, Alexander would drift further away.

She had to seize this opportunity.

Lillian stared toward the elevators, her fists clenched.

A look of grim determination flashed in her eyes.

...

The summit officially began the next day.

It was held in the conference hall adjacent to the hotel.

Guests started arriving at eight in the morning.

The forum commenced at nine.

After a brief opening by the host, the lecture session began.

Alexander Laurent was the youngest discipline leader in the country's physics community.

Last year, he was named the top young scientist by "Nature."

The organizers scheduled him as the second speaker.

Preceding him was Academician Ding Suiqian, a member of both academies.

This order sparked discussion.

Sophia overheard the murmurs around her.

"Alexander Laurent is too young to speak second, isn't he?"

"Academic achievement shouldn't be about seniority, but basic courtesy matters."

"Academician Ding first is fine, but Alexander second... There are still esteemed seniors like Academician Zhu and Academician Wang after him."

"The new generation surpasses the old. It's not good if the old guard gets left behind."

The sour grapes were plentiful.

Alexander was too young, his achievements too great.

He had碍ed some people's eyes and blocked some people's paths.

Being targeted with gossip was inevitable.

Heavy is the head that wears the crown.

Professor Eleanor Watson whispered, "Ignore them. They're just jealous. They wouldn't dare say any of that to his face."

Sophia couldn't help but smile.

She looked at the man on stage, precise and composed.

A light shimmered in her eyes.
###Chapter 475

Sophia Sullivan's gaze held admiration, envy, and yearning.

When would she stand at such a height herself?

To be discussed for her ability, to attract attention through her own skill.

She sighed softly.

She still wasn't working hard enough...

Alexander Laurent was outlining his research direction for the next decade.

A new type of quantum entanglement source.

Quantum light interference in free-space channels.

Three-dimensional imaging with quantum light.

His voice was steady, low and pleasant.

The content was specialized but not obscure.

He used accessible language understandable across different fields.

At this moment, Alexander was radiant, his charm utterly compelling.

Sophia sat in the audience.

Her prepared notebook finally came in handy.

She listened and took notes.

Fully focused, completely absorbed.

Not far away, Lillian Lopez watched Alexander in his suit on stage.

She listened to his eloquent speech, already mesmerized.

Staring at his handsome profile, she couldn't process his words.

Knowledge flowed like water, entering one ear and exiting the other.

Nothing remained.

She was lost in her infatuation, completely forgetting she was at an academic summit.

Only at times like this could she look at him freely.

Think of him.

Reveal her true feelings.

Each presentation was followed by a thirty-minute Q&A session.

This was often the most exciting part of the forum.

Because debates frequently erupted.

Like now.

The质疑 came from Professor Harrison, an expert in biophysics from Columbia University.

"Following your logic, physics is a specialized discipline requiring specialized research."

"Does this imply interdisciplinary studies lack purpose?"

"Should this interdisciplinary academic summit not even be held?"

Professor Harrison's criticism was challenging.

He didn't attack the professional content.

Instead, he seized on a perceived flaw in Alexander's wording.

It felt like...

He was picking a fight for no reason.

That was Sophia's opinion, at least.

Alexander had expected a blockbuster question.

This was disappointingly case.

But the atmosphere was charged, the stage set.

Not playing along would disappoint the audience.

Alexander raised a brow slightly.

He leaned into the microphone and spoke clearly.

"Since Professor Harrison is a leader in biophysics."

"And I am, in your view, a specialized 'extremist'."

"Any answer I give may lack persuasion."

"Perhaps..."

He paused, a slight smile touching his lips.

"I should invite a biology student to answer."

"Let's see, from a student's perspective, outside the scholar's role."

"Is my 'specialized research' the same as your 'rejection of interdisciplinary studies'?"

His gaze swept the audience, landing precisely on one spot.

"You, Sophia Sullivan."

The named person froze for two seconds.

Then she quickly collected herself.

She set down her pen and notebook.

Took a deep breath.

Rose calmly.

Accepted the microphone from the host.

"In my view, Professor Laurent's emphasis on 'specialization' is not wrong."

"Professor Harrison's insistence on interdisciplinary concept is also not wrong."

"Since neither is wrong, why the debate?"

Alexander raised a brow. "Could you elaborate on the reason?"

"It's simple. Different understandings, a deviation in perceiving these two concepts."

"But perception is inherently subjective..."

Sophia finished and prepared to sit.

Alexander posed another question.

"Could you combine research practice in biophysics to expand on your opinion?"

Sophia was surprised.

Even Professor Eleanor Watson glanced at Alexander twice.

Combining research practice to expand her opinion?

This was...

Undoubtedly giving Sophia a public platform to elaborate on her own research topic.

Such an occasion, such an opportunity...

Something many would crave, offered to Sophia so casually by Alexander.

Now the question was—

Take it?

Or not?

Emotions flickered in Sophia's eyes.

She looked at Alexander again.

Their eyes met.

She saw encouragement in his gaze.

And... trust?

He believed in her, hence giving her this chance to shine.

Since that was the case...

A slight curve touched Sophia's lips.

Her gaze turned resolute.

She wouldn't let him down.

"Of course. My research focuses on biological data model construction and..."

"In practice, I discovered..."

"From this, I derived..."

"Leading to the deduction..."

Every moment spent in the lab found its value now.

Every experimental step, every set of conclusion data, every parameter adjustment.

Sophia recalled them all, effortlessly.

She organized her thoughts with clarity.

Articulated the experiment with logical flow.

Concluded with concise precision.

She finished right as the session ended.

A "Thank you" accompanied by a slight bow.

She calmly returned the microphone to the host and resumed her seat.

Two seconds of silence.

Then thunderous applause erupted.

Even the critical Professor Harrison couldn't help but nod.

"A student? Which university?"

"Sitting next to Professor Watson, remembered by Alexander Laurent... MIT, right?"

"Sophia Sullivan... that name sounds familiar. Have I... heard it somewhere?"

"Wait! Now that you mention it, I have an impression... Ah! I remember!"

"That 'Boundless Lab' newly ranked in the national key laboratory list this year, know it?"

"I know. Only six papers from China in Nature Biotechnology last year, that lab took two."

"What does that have to do with that student?"

"Sophia Sullivan is from the Boundless Lab!"

"Huh? Isn't she from MIT? How is she connected to the Boundless Lab?"

"Let me tell you, there's quite a story there!"

"Oh?" A whiff of gossip?

"..."

Soon, whispers rose from the audience.

Words like "MIT administration," "fire safety rectification," "self-established lab" peppered the chatter...

Yet Sophia, at the center of the议论, remained calm, detached.

Professor Watson was the same, even radiating a sense of shared pride.

Lillian Lopez sat in a corner.

She watched Sophia speak eloquently.

Exchange glances with Alexander.

Finally cause a sturr and discussion.

First, she anticipated a good show.

Then, she was stunned by Sophia's performance.

Finally, it turned into deep jealousy.

Why her?
###Chapter 476

She was supposed to be on Alexander Laurent's team.

Yet the chance to shine had fallen to Sophia Sullivan.

It was favoritism.

The morning forum concluded.

Lunch was uniformly arranged at the hotel.

After an hour's rest, the afternoon session continued.

The same process.

Different guest speakers.

Different academic fields.

Sophia's pen flew across the page.

Her notebook filled, one page after another.

She became more engrossed the longer she listened.

The fascinating connections between disciplines amazed her.

It was like a symphony.

Piano and violin in duet.

Flute and zither in harmony.

Dulcimer and harp complementing each other.

Together, they composed a magnificent movement.

This was the charm of interdisciplinary studies.

Bioinformatics meeting astrophysics.

Applied chemistry colliding with biomedical science.

Her brain was flooded with new knowledge.

It would take time to digest it all.

The forum ended at five in the afternoon.

Sophia and Professor Eleanor Watson returned to the hotel.

Professor Watson changed her jacket.

She carefully styled her hair.

"Sophia, get ready. You're coming to dinner with me."

"Aren't we eating at the hotel?"

"It's a gathering of old friends. You're coming along."

Sophia hesitated. "Is it appropriate for me to be there?"

"You are my most accomplished student. Meeting senior colleagues is only natural."

It was an opportunity for academic networking.

Professor Watson was deliberately including her.

"Alright," Sophia nodded. "I'll change."

Professor Watson waited with a smile.

They arrived at the designated location.

Sophia noticed Alexander Laurent was also there.

Professor Watson's arrival caused everyone to rise.

"Eleanor's here!"

"We thought you weren't coming."

Professor Watson's lips curved upward. "I wouldn't dare miss Old Moore's gathering."

"Haha... That's debatable! We've all tried to arrange meetings. You haven't attended many of ours!"

Professor Watson feigned anger. "Stirring trouble the moment I step in? Old Huang, what are you scheming?"

"Haha... I wouldn't dare! Everyone treasures you. I even heard Old Moore secretly ordered extra dishes."

Professor Moore: "..."

"Hahaha..."

Amid the laughter, someone noticed Sophia.

"Eleanor, you brought a young friend today?"

"Yes," Professor Watson drew Sophia closer. "My most accomplished student. I hope you'll all look out for her in the future."

The group turned their full attention to Sophia.

"Of course! A student Eleanor is proud of must be exceptional. What guidance could we possibly offer?"

"Young people can always benefit from listening and learning."

"I'm very curious about the student who has earned Eleanor's high praise."

"Alexander is familiar with this topic, right? You called on Sophia to answer a question this morning."

Alexander hadn't expected the conversation to turn to him.

He quickly recovered. "An MIT master's student, Professor Watson's pupil. It's not strange that I know her."

"Haha... Not strange at all! Not strange at all!"

"Enough talk, Eleanor, take a seat!"

"Sophia, you too..."

This was Sophia's first time at a private academic gathering.

She discovered professors and scholars were quite relaxed in private.

They cracked jokes.

They spoke loudly.

They laughed heartily.

Professor Watson raised her glass first.

Paving the way for Sophia.

Sophia politely returned the toasts a few times.

After a few rounds of drinks, an elderly professor struck up a conversation with her.

They discussed everything from her specialty to her aspirations.

From papers to experiments.

The old professor's admiration grew increasingly evident.

"Haha... Young minds are so sharp! Why don't my students have this? Comparisons are truly frustrating!"

He looked at Professor Watson. "Where did you find this student? You snatch up all the promising seedlings?"

Leaving no opportunities for anyone else?

Professor Watson thought for a moment. "Perhaps I have a good eye? I spotted her immediately? What can I say, I recognize talent."

The old professor scoffed. "I'm not trying to steal your student. Who are you implying has a poor eye?"

"Old Gao, who was it last time that claimed poor eyesight and insisted on taking the tea I'd been saving for two years?"

A professor nearby immediately exposed him.

"Ahem, weren't we discussing the student's excellence? Why bring that up..."

The topic drifted away.

Sophia listened with a smile.

She reached for her wine glass.

Alexander handed her a glass of milk instead.

"Drink less. The sentiment is enough."

Sophia looked up, slightly tipsy.

Her hazy, drunken gaze settled on Alexander.

The man's breath hitched.

Alexander didn't play games.

He didn't understand the term "hard crowd control."

Until—

Sophia nodded gently. "Okay."

She picked up the glass and drank the milk.

It was still warm.

The dinner concluded at nine PM.

The night was pitch black.

City lights glittered brightly.

No one was drunk.

No one behaved inappropriately.

As they left the gathering place.

Their shirt buttons remained neatly fastened.

They carried a faint scent of alcohol.

But they still maintained the dignified demeanor of scholars.

...

Lillian Lopez heard noises in the hallway.

She peered through the peephole.

Professor Watson, Alexander, and Sophia were returning together.

Sophia had actually gone!

Lillian knew Alexander was attending the gathering of academic luminaries.

She had试探atively asked if she could accompany him.

Alexander didn't take the bait.

Finally, she directly asked if she could go to gain some exposure.

Alexander replied, "It wouldn't be appropriate."

Then he left.

How utterly "inappropriate"!

But it was appropriate for Sophia?

Sophia got all the good opportunities.

Professor Watson clearing her path.

Alexander attending to her every need.

Hmph...
###Chapter 477

Eleanor Watson returned to her room first.

Alexander Laurent handed the shawl to Sophia Sullivan.

He asked softly, "Are you alright?"

Sophia took the shawl.

She smiled. "I'm not drunk."

Alexander let out a sigh of relief.

Sophia looked at him. "Thank you for this morning."

He raised an eyebrow. "For what?"

"You called on me."

"The question was simple. Anyone could have answered it."

His gaze was gentle. "I gave you the opportunity, but you had to be ready to seize it."

Sophia was slightly taken aback.

Alexander's voice was low. "Thank yourself."

"Thank me?"

"Yes. Thank yourself for your usual hard work."

He paused. "Opportunity favors the prepared."

Sophia nodded.

Alexander looked at her. "Go back and rest."

"There's another meeting tomorrow."

Sophia turned and entered her room.

Alexander watched until her door closed.

Only then did he swipe his card and enter his own room.

Lillian Lopez watched everything through the peephole.

Her nails dug into her palms.

Jealousy burned painfully in her chest.

Her phone suddenly vibrated.

She snatched it up to look.

Simon Lowell's name glowed on the screen.

Lillian's face darkened.

She threw the phone onto the bed.

The vibration continued incessantly.

She turned it off directly.

She lay down on the bed and closed her eyes.

...

Dr. Zoe Langley removed her mask.

She saw Simon Lowell standing at the doorway.

"Simon?"

Simon turned around and forced a smile. "Dr. Langley."

"You're still here?"

Zoe glanced at the phone in his hand.

Simon quickly put it away. "Working overtime analyzing data."

Zoe nodded. "Don't overwork yourself."

"How is your mother's health?"

Simon was momentarily stunned. "She's been hospitalized for treatment."

Zoe patted his shoulder. "Take care of yourself."

She turned and left.

Simon took out his phone.

The screen stayed on the call log.

Lillian hadn't answered his call.

He frowned in thought.

Was the meeting that busy?

He pursed his lips in frustration.

Finally, he sent a WeChat message.

["Goodnight, Lillian."]

...

The final day of the conference.

The morning was reserved for free communication.

Eleanor Watson took Sophia Sullivan around.

Many people initiated conversations with her.

Seniors in the field of biology were very friendly.

The physics circle also showed her respect.

Alexander Laurent made personal introductions.

He smiled as he introduced her to an old friend. "This is Sophia Sullivan."

Someone teased, "Professor Laurent, so enthusiastic?"

Alexander said calmly, "She's my junior fellow apprentice."

Everyone laughed.

Lillian Lopez wanted to join in.

But no one paid her any attention.

She felt like a ghost.

Awkward and humiliated.

After the lunch break, a bus took them to the fishing village.

Jinshanzui was the last fishing village in the city.

It retained its original style after development.

The tour guide led everyone to visit the cultural center.

They experienced net weaving and fish salting in the old houses.

After that, it was free time.

Alexander looked at Sophia. "Going to the beach?"

Sophia nodded.

There were many beautiful bed and breakfasts by the sea.

Sophia looked around curiously.

Alexander walked by her side.

The sea breeze lifted her long hair.

Sophia took off her canvas shoes.

She stepped barefoot into the sand.

The cool sensation made her squint.

Alexander reached out his hand. "Give me your shoes."

Sophia was startled.

Alexander chuckled softly. "Don't you want to collect seashells?"

The tips of her ears turned slightly red.

Alexander took the shoes.

He pointed into the distance. "Go play."

Sophia ran toward the sea.

Waves rolled onto the sand.

Alexander watched her retreating figure.

His gaze was tender and indulgent.
###Chapter 478

Sophia Sullivan bent down and picked up a seashell.

It shimmered with a mix of purple and orange hues.

It was particularly dazzling under the sunlight.

She waved excitedly at Alexander Laurent.

"Professor! Look!"

She was like a child who had discovered treasure.

She was eager to share her find.

Alexander quickly walked closer.

She opened her palm.

The shell rested quietly there.

"Beautiful?" Sophia asked.

Alexander gazed at her radiant face.

He smiled and nodded. "Very beautiful."

"Then... do you want to take off your shoes and play together?"

The man cleared his throat softly. "Next time."

Sophia laughed and agreed.

The corners of Alexander's mouth lifted.

She had also tacitly agreed there would be a next time.

The two strolled along the beach.

Waves occasionally washed over Sophia's ankles.

Alexander stood on the shore.

His gaze never left her.

"Professor, where do you think we'd end up if we just kept walking straight ahead?"

She was walking backward.

Her hands were clasped behind her back.

Her posture was relaxed.

Alexander pondered for a moment.

"The shore ends in sand."

"The sand's destiny is the sea."

Sophia was taken aback for a second.

Then she laughed. "I thought you'd explain it with geographical terms."

She mimicked his usual tone perfectly.

Alexander couldn't help but chuckle.

"You've already said it for me."

"Of course, if you want a professional explanation…"

Sophia quickly waved her hands.

The sea breeze tousled her long hair.

"No, no. This is perfect just as it is."

All rivers flow to the sea.

Born from the sea, returning to the sea.

Alexander's fingers twitched slightly.

He wanted to tuck her stray hairs behind her ear several times.

He restrained himself every time.

It wasn't appropriate yet.

He reminded himself.

Waves crashed against the shore.

The tide was coming in.

The man glanced at the sky.

Clouds covered the sun.

The area grew darker.

The May seaside was cool even without wind.

"Sophia, we should head back. The tide is rising."

"Okay." Sophia nodded.

She was always reasonable.

In just this short while, she already felt cold.

They found the rinsing area.

Alexander tested the water temperature. It was warm.

Sophia was about to reach for the hose.

But he had already bent down.

He held the hose and washed the sand from her feet.

After rinsing, Sophia hurried to find her bag for a towel.

Alexander had one ready.

He handed it to her.

"Thank you!"

He was always so thoughtful.

Sophia thought to herself.

They put their shoes on and started walking back.

The meeting time was four-thirty.

They were leaving the island at five. It was four now. The walk back was perfect.

On the way, Sophia suddenly stopped.

She pointed towards the sea.

"A boat! Professor! The fishing boat is back!"

The boat slowly approached the shore.

It was fruitful.

Sophia pulled him forward to look.

Crabs, fish, and shrimp jumped about in the net.

Each one was plump and fresh.

"Setting sail and returning fruitful. It's wonderful."

Alexander nodded.

His gaze fell on her retreating figure with a devout softness.

Yes, it was wonderful.

...

At five, the bus left the island on time.

They returned to the hotel at six.

As Sophia got off the bus, an event staff member handed her a red invitation.

"What's this?" She had a guess but asked anyway.

The staff member smiled. "You were outstanding, Miss Sullivan. We look forward to your presence at the academic banquet tonight."

Then they turned and left.

Sophia held the invitation.

She felt stunned, surprised, and finally, acceptance.

The academic banquet after the interdisciplinary summit traditionally only invited standout researchers.

Authorities like Eleanor Watson and Alexander Laurent had received theirs on the first day.

By past practice, each invitation allowed for one additional guest.

Eleanor had already spoken with Sophia.

"Come with me that night after it ends."

Sophia had naturally agreed.

Who knew Alexander would also ask the next day.

"Would you like to go together?"

Uh!

Sophia had to tell the truth. "Professor Watson already invited me."

"Right," the man nodded. "Professor Watson has an invitation. She would definitely bring you."

Actually, Sophia was puzzled.

Since Alexander had brought Lillian Lopez to the conference, logically, he should take her to the banquet.

Why did he ask me?

If she had really agreed, Lillian…

Just thinking about it made her feel awkward for Lillian.

Now Sophia had received an invitation on her own merit.

How could she not be shocked? How could she not be excited?

The invitation was small, but the recognition was what mattered.

It meant "Sophia Sullivan" was seen by the academic world.

Not just as "Eleanor Watson's student."

...

Lillian Lopez wasn't so fortunate.

She was practically invisible throughout the entire conference.

Naturally, she didn't receive an invitation.

But she knew Alexander had one.

If he was willing, he could take her.

After returning to the hotel, she found Alexander.

She indirectly brought up the banquet.

"I heard Sophia Sullivan is also going?"

"Yes."

A flash of jealousy appeared in Lillian's eyes.

"That's great. She's going with Professor Watson, right?"

"I heard many renowned scholars will be at the banquet. Getting their guidance would be incredibly beneficial... Professor, could I..."

Alexander interrupted her. "Sophia isn't going with Professor Watson."

"...What?" Lillian was stunned.

"Sophia received her own invitation from the organizers."

Lillian was completely speechless.

It took her a moment to recover.

"...I see. Congratulations!"

Her tone was unavoidably bitter.

Her eyes shifted.

"Wasn't the invitation only for specific individuals? A student like Sophia Sullivan attending such a banquet... isn't it against the rules? After all, many people don't even qualify."

She spoke calmly, but inside she was seething with sourness.

A student could go, but she, an associate professor, couldn't? So unfair!

"The organizers decide who to invite. I'm not clear on the specific rules. If you have questions, you can ask them directly. I'm sure they'd be happy to explain."

Alexander was noncommittal. He handled it formally.

Lillian gritted her teeth.

She couldn't actually go ask the organizers. Wouldn't that be even more humiliating?

She forced a smile.

"No need. I think it's fine this way. I won't trouble you further."

Alexander checked the time.

"Since that's all, I'll take my leave."

Any later, and he'd be late for the banquet.
###Chapter 479

Moonlight streamed down like water.

The banquet was held in the hotel's largest ballroom.

Attendees could return to their rooms to freshen up before proceeding directly to the event.

There was no red carpet.
No flowers.

Simple drink stations and food areas defined the banquet space.

Men wore blazers or suit trousers.
Some even arrived in plaid shirts straight from the forum.

The women were noticeably more polished.
Their hair was neat, their attire appropriate.
There were casual outfits, elegant dresses, and modern interpretations of classic styles.

Men significantly outnumbered women in the room.
A few young faces were also present.
Most were students accompanying their mentors to gain experience.

Sophia Sullivan entered with Alexander Laurent, invitation in hand.
Their arrival immediately drew numerous gazes.

Professor Eleanor Watson was already there.
She paused briefly upon seeing the pair enter together.

Alexander wore a relaxed-fit suit, less formal and more approachable.
Sophia was bare-faced except for a touch of lipstick for color.
A camel coat over a cream knit sweater was simple and comfortable.

But she was too young.
Too beautiful.
No one believed she belonged at such an event.
Fewer still thought she was an academic.

Alexander cleared his throat softly.
His gaze swept the room, calm yet imposing.
The staring eyes quickly turned away.

Sophia breathed a quiet sigh of relief.

Eleanor approached and linked arms with her. "Nervous?"
"A little."
"Don't worry. Let me introduce you to some old friends."
"Alright."

Alexander watched Sophia being led away and sighed almost inaudibly.

A hand clapped his shoulder.
"Quite captivated, Alexander?"
"Professor Anderson."

The older man followed Alexander's previous line of sight.
He saw nothing remarkable and turned back, clearing his throat.
"Alexander, how is your recent research progressing?"
"Well."

"You see…" Professor Anderson rubbed his hands together, choosing his words. "A student from my lab, Wu Huiqing, just finished her Ph.D. She secured a postdoctoral position here this year."

Alexander raised an eyebrow, waiting.

"You both attended the International Physics Exchange in Los Angeles. Remember?"

Alexander remained silent.
Dozens of scholars had attended from the country.
His memory was good, but not photographic.

Professor Anderson coughed lightly to mask the awkwardness.
"Perfectly normal not to remember everyone… Huiqing remembers you quite well. Perhaps you could exchange contacts? Get to know each other?"

Alexander was caught off guard.
He hadn't expected a matchmaking attempt.
"My apologies…"

Professor Anderson was stunned.

Alexander paused.
"I'm interested in someone else."
"...What?"

The professor had prepared for rejection.
Countless people had tried to set Alexander up over the years, always met with a polite "not considering it at this time."
He hadn't even wanted to ask.
But his student was stubbornly fixated on Alexander.
He had braced for the usual refusal, thinking 'what's the harm in trying?'

But this—
Interested in someone?

Professor Anderson stood frozen in shock.
He was still rooted to the spot long after Alexander had walked away.
Who could it be?

Meanwhile, Sophia followed Eleanor and met several senior academics.
She stood quietly, listening to their conversation.

Eleanor leaned in and whispered, "Hungry? Go get something to eat."
"Okay."

She could follow the professional discussions.
But when the talk turned to personal matters and family gossip, she made her escape.
She feared hearing too much and accidentally letting something slip.
Some of the gossip was far too explosive.

She browsed the drink station and dessert area.
She picked up a hot beverage and selected a few pastries.
She felt about seventy percent full after eating.

Seeing Eleanor deep in conversation, she didn't interrupt.
She quietly made her way toward the ballroom's rear exit.

It led to a small garden.
The night air was cool.
Pushing the door open, crisp air washed over her, clearing her mind.

The noise faded as she walked down the corridor.
Quiet settled around her.
She strolled through the garden, hands behind her back.
Breathing the fresh air, feeling the gentle evening breeze.
All her constraints melted away in that moment.

The summit and forums had been a relentless cycle.
She hadn't dared relax for a second.
Only now did she truly unwind.

She looked up at the sky.
City lights drowned out the stars, leaving only faint glimmers.
In the distance, countless lights and neon signs glittered.

A garden path led to a glass conservatory.
A shell wind chime hung by the door.
It tinkled softly in the night breeze.

Sophia stopped at the steps, not venturing inside.

A light chuckle sounded behind her.
"It's you."

Sophia turned.
A man in his forties stood not far away.
He had regular features and was dressed in a well-tailored suit.
His wine glass held a third of its red wine.
He looked at her with an amused smile.

"...May I ask who you are?" Sophia used a polite form of address.

"Song Wei. Professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology."
His Mandarin carried a distinct Cantonese accent.

"Professor Song." Sophia nodded in acknowledgment.
She prepared to leave.

He stopped her.
"Wait a moment."

Sophia turned back.
"Was there something else, Professor Song?"
###Chapter 480

Sophia Sullivan offered a polite smile. "While I don't mind conversation, our academic fields are quite different."

"Yesterday at the forum, you said the charm of research lies in the symphony of interdisciplinary collaboration. If I recall correctly?"

"...You're not wrong."

The man chuckled, a low, deliberate sound. "You spoke very well. It left quite an impression."

The forced magnetism of his laugh grated on Sophia's ears.

Alexander Laurent's laugh was so much more pleasant...

She pulled her thoughts back. "Professor Song, I've been out too long. My advisor will be looking for me."

She turned to leave.

"Sophia Sullivan—" Song Wei called out directly, stopping her. "Who is your advisor? Professor Gao Qingxu? Professor Moore Kaizhou? Or is it Alexander Laurent?"

He named the senior professors.

All connections of Professor Eleanor Watson.

Sophia frowned. "What are you implying?"

"I saw everything." Song Wei's lips curved into a smirk.

"?"

"Last night at The Celestial Residence. You seemed to be having a very good time with them."

He emphasized the words "good time," his suggestive expression leaving little to the imagination.

Sophia's gaze turned icy. "Please show some respect."

"Playing innocent? Isn't it their doing that you're even here? I didn't expect them to be so willing to share."

Song Wei looked her up and down. "Young and beautiful. A rare sight in these circles. Since you can't be exclusive, why not be generous? It would be good for you too."

"Marvelous! Truly marvelous!"

He laughed again.

Sophia finally understood why his laugh was so irritating.

The man was just vile.

"Professor Song, please show some respect."

"Oh? Am I wrong? Wasn't it them who brought you in?"

Sophia gave a cold laugh. "Why couldn't I have come in on my own?"

"Haha... On your own? What status? What qualifications? Do you even have an invitation?"

"I do." Her tone was flat.

Song Wei scoffed. "Impossible!"

His disbelief lasted until Sophia pulled a red invitation from her bag. Her name was clearly printed in the guest section.

Song Wei's face changed dramatically. "Who pulled strings to get you that invitation?"

Sophia only responded with a colder laugh.

She saw no point in further words.

"Stop— Did I say you could leave?" Song Wei's voice dropped, turning harsh.

Sophia didn't look back. "Do I need your permission to leave? What are you? Just a mangy old dog!"

"You—"

Furious and humiliated, Song Wei lunged after her. His hand was about to grasp her shoulder when a cold, sharp voice cut through the air—

"Song Wei, dare to lay a finger on her and see what happens?!"

Alexander Laurent hadn't been able to find her inside and grew restless.

He'd asked a server and finally tracked her down.

Approaching, he saw Song Wei reaching for her. The words burst out in urgent anger.

Song Wei froze mid-action.

Sophia was startled, then smiled and walked towards Alexander.

"Professor—"

Alexander looked her over carefully, relaxing only when he confirmed she was unharmed. "Why did you come out? Isn't it cold?"

His tone was gentle, a complete contrast to his earlier shout at Song Wei.

"It was stuffy inside. I came out for air. Ran into a rabid dog. Wish I hadn't."

She looked thoroughly disgusted.

She might as well have pointed directly at Song Wei.

Song Wei gritted his teeth in anger.

He suddenly let out a cold laugh. "I wondered whose student could be so insolent. Professor Laurent's. That explains it."

"It's been a while. When did you take on such a pretty female student, Professor Laurent? She must be very... agreeable to teach."

"Then again, you're never short of beautiful women around you. Quite the enviable luck."

Song Wei's tone turned snide, dripping with insinuation aimed at Alexander.

Earlier in the year, they had competed for a national-level project. Song Wei lost to Alexander.

He lost again during the Outstanding Young Scholar selection.

The grudge was firmly set.

Song Wei was based in Hong Kong, Alexander in Boston. They rarely crossed paths.

Now, with an opportunity handed to him, Song Wei wasn't about to waste it.

His eyes swept between them. "I thought you, Professor Laurent, were truly above such temptations. Turns out you just prefer them young and pretty."

"Since we're all old friends, why don't we... share the fun?"

"Shut your mouth—"

As Alexander raised his fist, Sophia's slap was faster.

Smack!

The crisp sound froze the air.

Several seconds later, Song Wei stared in disbelief. "You— You dare hit me?"

"I hit you because you deserved it. Should I check my calendar first?"

"You bitch— An academic seductress who sleeps her way to the top, and you dare raise your hand?!"

He lifted his hand to strike back, but Alexander intercepted his wrist mid-air and shoved him away.

Song Wei staggered back two steps.

Sophia: "Pathetic— So weak!"

"You—"

"Professor Song, this slap is to teach you to watch your mouth, especially regarding women. As a university professor, an expert scholar, how can you say such things? Where is your integrity? Your breeding? Your basic morality? Did you feed it all to the dogs?"

"Who do you think you are? Lecturing me?"

"Yes, I am lecturing you. Can't you tell?"

"Don't you dare say you didn't rely on a man to get that invitation? To attend this summit?"

Alexander: "Bullshit—"

Seeing Alexander's anger, Song Wei subtly pressed a button on his phone.

"Admit it. Sophia Sullivan is your little mistress. To be precise, a shared mistress."

"Alexander Laurent, you play a wild game! Pretending to be a righteous gentleman, but you're actually this kind of trash."
###Chapter 481

Sophia Sullivan's lips curved into a smile.

But there was no trace of amusement in her eyes.

"In your view, do all accomplished women achieve success by relying on men?"

"Professor Rui Bai from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology is a top astrophysicist in the country."

"A specially appointed professor at the National Space Administration."

"Who did she rely on?"

"Who in this field is more accomplished than her?"

"How dare you dismiss her efforts with a single sentence?"

"Just because your mind is filthy?"

"You see everyone through a distorted lens?"

"Or is your brain only capable of such narrow thinking?"

"Completely blind to the contributions of women in science?"

"Before today, I thought this summit was attended by esteemed scholars."

"Clearly, I was mistaken."

Song Wei's face turned ashen.

He was about to retort.

Eleanor Watson entered through the door on the left.

Her gaze behind her glasses was icy cold.

"Professor Song, I heard everything you just said."

"Sophia is my student."

"I don't know what you were implying."

"But I will not allow my student to be slandered."

"Apologize to her."

Eleanor's tone was firm.

Her protective nature was evident.

Song Wei looked uncomfortable.

Seeing the growing crowd of onlookers.

He ultimately cared about saving face.

"It was just a joke..."

Sophia cut him off coldly.

"That joke wasn't funny at all."

Alexander Laurent added calmly.

"If the joke involves belittling women's academic achievements."

"And slandering student-teacher relationships."

"Then it's gone far beyond a joke."

Song Wei knew he couldn't salvage the situation.

He offered a reluctant apology.

Then hurried away.

Alexander watched his retreating figure.

His voice remained even.

"Next time, feel free to record openly."

"No need to be sneaky about it."

The man stumbled slightly.

He practically fled.

Eleanor took Sophia's hand.

Her tone softened.

"Are you alright?"

"I'm fine."

"I even slapped him."

Eleanor nodded.

"Good for you."

"Thankfully Professor Laurent arrived in time."

Eleanor turned to Alexander.

"Alexander, thank you for protecting Sophia tonight."

Alexander's lips quirked upward.

"It was the least I could do."

Besides...

Song Wei's attack was clearly aimed at him.

After the drama.

None of them were in the mood to stay.

They left the banquet early.

Alexander returned to his hotel room.

As he entered, he noticed a faint scent.

He assumed it was cleaning product.

He didn't think much of it.

He changed into slippers.

He went straight to the shower.

After his shower.

He wore a robe.

He turned on the air conditioning.

The night air was cool.

He adjusted the temperature higher.

The room warmed up quickly.

He opened his laptop.

He took out his documents.

He began to work.

Some time passed.

He felt thirsty.

He retrieved two bottles of cold water from the mini-fridge.

He drank a few sips.

He buried himself in the data again.

Only the sound of keyboard clicks filled the room.

Alexander reached for the water bottle again.

He found both were empty.

He was still parched.

Sweat beaded on his back.

He stood up and turned off the air conditioning.

He opened the window.

He continued working.

His focus was intense.

He didn't notice the scent in the room growing stronger.

Soon.

Alexander felt his body heating up.

He impatiently loosened his robe.

Revealing his well-defined chest.

He thought it would bring relief.

But the internal heat did not subside.

Until—

His breathing became ragged.

He finally realized something was wrong.
###Chapter 482

Lillian Lopez paced her room.

She kept checking her watch.

Time moved too slowly.

She bit her lip.

The silence was unnerving.

It made her anxious.

She picked up her phone several times.

Then put it down.

The appointed time finally arrived.

She took a deep breath.

Opened her door.

Walked across the hall.

Adjusted her expression.

Raised her hand to knock.

She tried to sound calm. "Professor? Are you there? I found an issue with the A-3 data while compiling the report. I'd like to discuss it."

No response came from within.

"Professor? It's Lillian Lopez."

Still silence.

She assumed the drug had taken effect.

"Professor?! Are you okay? Please open the door? I'm worried..."

She knocked for two full minutes.

Her hand turned red.

Still no answer.

She frowned.

Had he not returned?

Impossible.

She saw Alexander Laurent enter forty minutes ago.

Had he gone out again?

Unlikely at this hour.

Given Alexander's character.

He would respond even if he didn't open the door.

He wouldn't just stay silent.

Lillian peered through the peephole.

It was pitch black inside.

She pressed her ear against the door.

Heard nothing.

She knocked again. "Professor, I know you're in there. It's urgent. Could you please open the door?"

Dead silence.

Her expression grew increasingly grim.

"Professor, if you don't open the door, I'll have to call the front desk. I'm serious?"

She took out her phone.

Still no response.

A sense of foreboding washed over Lillian.

She dialed the front desk. "Hello, my friend in his room might be in trouble. I need you to open the door..."

As she waited.

Various scenarios flashed through Lillian's mind.

Had he fainted?

Fallen asleep?

Or was the drug too strong, leaving him immobilized?

Regardless.

Alexander should be in there.

Hotel staff arrived quickly.

Used a master key to open the door.

The room was empty!

Lillian rushed in.

Checked the bathroom and balcony.

"How is this possible?"

The bathroom was wet.

Proving Alexander had returned and showered.

A faint scent lingered in the air.

Confirming the drug had taken effect.

But where was he?

"Miss Lopez, your friend—"

The hotel staff began.

Lillian quickly regained her composure. "He must have stepped out unexpectedly. My apologies for the trouble."

"Should the hotel assist in locating him?"

"No, he should be back soon."

The staff left.

Lillian grew more uneasy.

Alexander was under the influence.

Where could he have gone?

Her gaze shifted to the room across the hall.

She walked over and knocked.

"Sophia? Are you there?"

A voice answered from inside. "Who is it?"

"Lillian Lopez."

The door opened.

Sophia Sullivan stood there in pajamas.

Her hair was damp.

Fresh from the shower. "Can I help you?"

Her tone was flat.

Lillian glanced past her. "Have you seen Professor Laurent?"

"I saw him at the banquet. We came back together."

"And after that?" Lillian pressed urgently.

"What do you mean after that?" Sophia looked puzzled.

"After returning, didn't he come to see you?"

Sophia frowned. "Why would the professor come to see me at this hour?"

"I... didn't mean it that way..." Lillian forced a laugh.

Sophia studied her.

Her gaze suddenly sharpened. "You're acting strange. Did something happen to the professor?"

She moved to knock on the door across the hall.

Lillian quickly stopped her. "The professor is resting. Don't disturb him."

"Then why did you ask like that?" Sophia persisted.

"Just making conversation. Is that not allowed?"

Lillian turned to leave.

Muttering under her breath. "Paranoid much..."

She didn't dare stay longer.

Afraid of giving herself away.

Let alone searching Sophia's room.

She just wanted to get away.

Sophia closed the door.

Took a deep breath.

Walked toward the bathroom.

The tub was full of water.

The faucet was still running.

Water had overflowed onto the floor.

She stepped through the water.

A man lay in the tub.

His robe was open.

Soaking in cold water.

Eyes closed.

Breathing heavily.

His cheeks flushed an unnatural red.

It was Alexander Laurent.

Hearing footsteps.

He slowly opened his eyes.

Their gazes met.

Sophia froze.

Those always-calm eyes were now bloodshot.

Clouded with haze.

Deep within them was struggle and endurance.

"Professor..." she called softly.

Alexander's dark eyes were intense.

He gritted his teeth. "Who was it?"

"..."

"Tell me."

Sophia answered truthfully. "Lillian Lopez."

The man let out a short laugh.

It held anger.

And even more disgust.

Sophia noticed his ragged breathing.

"You can't stay in there any longer. Get out now!"

"Get out."

Sophia was stunned.

Alexander spoke each word clearly. "Get. Out. Now!"

"How can I leave you like this?" Sophia was furious.

And he was still being harsh.

"Sophia, listen to me..." the man said with a bitter smile.

His tone was pleading.

If he had remained firm.

Sophia might have argued back.

But hearing his near-pleading tone.

That gentle "Sophia."

Her nose stung.

Damn Lillian Lopez!

How dare she?

This wasn't the time for blame.

Sophia said, "Let me help you up."

She reached for his arm.

The moment she touched him.

He flinched violently.

Shook her off.

Alexander turned away.

Wrapped his arms around himself.

A defensive posture.

"...Don't touch me."

His voice was hoarse.

Sophia was speechless. "You..."
###Chapter 483

Sophia Sullivan was no naive young girl.

She immediately recognized the physical change in Alexander Laurent.

Could it be...

"Did the cold water not help at all?"

Alexander had his back to her.

She couldn't see his expression, only heard a stifled reply.

"...No."

"Then you... I..."

Sophia floundered, feeling flustered.

"Sophia, please leave first." He paused, his voice low and hoarse. "I don't want you to see me like this."

He added softly, "...Would you?"

"...Okay."

Sophia stepped out of the bathroom, closing the door gently behind her.

The moment she turned around, tears welled up and spilled over.

He was pleading with her.

Begging her to preserve his last shred of dignity.

So she left.

Hearing the door click shut, Alexander's tense body suddenly went slack.

He sank completely into the cold water.

The icy water submerged his limbs, bringing a biting chill.

Yet it couldn't suppress the raging heat coursing through him.

No, there had been a moment of relief.

The instant Sophia touched him, that slight coolness made him crave more.

Having tasted that relief, the current feverish agitation was unbearable.

Fearing he might lose control and hurt her, he had to make her leave.

She was gone now, her scent gradually fading.

But the fire inside him burned hotter and fiercer.

Alexander buried his head under the water.

Out of sight, out of smell.

But the alluring images in his mind grew only clearer.

The desire to hold her, to kiss her, grew overwhelming.

No...

This can't happen...

Alexander bit his tongue under the water.

The taste of blood spread, the pain granting a moment of clarity.

But it wasn't enough...

Sophia sat on the edge of the bed.

She wasn't trying to listen, but the sound of water from the bathroom kept reaching her.

Beneath the water's noise, there were also the man's suppressed groans.

She guessed what they meant, her cheeks flushing warm.

She didn't know how long it had been, so long she worried he might have passed out, and was just about to go knock on the door—

The bathroom door opened.

The man walked out barefoot, wearing a clean robe, his hair still dripping.

Water droplets trailed down his neck, disappearing into his chest.

"Are you okay?" Sophia immediately stood and walked toward him.

The man's face was still flushed, but his eyes were clear, no longer clouded.

"It's fine now..."

"That's good..." Sophia let out a sigh of relief.

She turned to pour water, pressed the glass into his hand, and noticed his hand was trembling.

"Professor, you—"

"I'm fine," he repeated.

Sophia directly pushed him to sit on the bed, ignoring his evasion, and reached out to feel his forehead. "You're burning up! You have a fever!"

"Yeah."

"And you just say 'yeah'?!"

She immediately called the front desk. "I need fever reducers. If you don't have any, please go buy some ibuprofen from the pharmacy. Yes, right now!"

Fortunately, the hotel kept common medications.

In less than ten minutes, a staff member brought the fever reducers, along with cooling patches and alcohol swabs.

Under the man's resigned gaze, Sophia ordered him to lie down.

"...This is your bed..."

"At a time like this, we're still splitting hairs over yours and mine? It's a hotel bed! We paid for it, anyone can sleep on it!"

Alexander: "..."

Sophia made him take the medicine first.

Then she tore open a cooling patch and was about to apply it when her wrist was suddenly caught.

"What's wrong?"

The man's palm was scorching, like a branding iron.

"Sophia, do you know what you're doing?"

Sophia waved the cooling patch. "Bringing your fever down. Is there a problem?"

Alexander's gaze was intense. "You're sheltering a man who's been drugged."

"And?" she raised an eyebrow.

"You could be in danger."

"Then will you put me in danger?" she retorted.

Alexander gave a bitter smile. "...I'm not as noble as you think. When the drug takes full effect, I lose control."

The moment he caught her wrist, Alexander felt like he was holding a piece of soft, cool jade.

The delicate texture made him crave more...

Not just her wrist.

But Sophia said, "You are."

The man was stunned. "...What?"

"You are that noble. If you wanted to lose control, you would have done it in the bathroom just now, wouldn't you?"

"..."

Alexander released her hand.

Sophia helped him apply the cooling patch. "Do you feel a bit better now?"

"Yeah. The medicine should bring the fever down soon."

"Ahem! I mean... your body. That... has it subsided?"

Alexander's face flushed even redder.

"You..."

Had she heard?

How much had she heard?

Would she think he was vulgar?

These questions were too embarrassing to voice.

Seeing his silence, Sophia realized her question might have been too direct.

But...

She had been quite tactful.

Why was he blushing so hard?

"Ahem! You rest first. I'll get you more water. You need to hydrate when you have a fever... Yes, drink plenty of water..."

Sophia picked up the water glass, took a deep breath, returned to the bedside, and handed it to him.

Their eyes met, the atmosphere awkward.

"You... what are you planning to do next?"

Seeing Alexander finish the water, she took the cup and set it aside, speaking up first.

The man's eyes turned cold. "I can guess who it was. Her behavior afterward confirmed my suspicion. But that drug..."

Alexander thought carefully, his frown deepening.

It smelled like lavender, with a hint of jasmine, very faint.

Perhaps because the effect had already started to dissipate by the time he returned to the room.

Sophia thought he had ingested something. "Was it from the banquet, or the hotel?"

Alexander shook his head. "It wasn't a liquid. It was in the air."

"Huh?"

He explained about noticing the scent. Sophia immediately understood the severity.

"I took a pharmaceutics elective. Aphrodisiacs usually come in liquid, pill, or powder form and work through ingestion. Things like incense in dramas are theoretically possible but require a sealed space, continuous burning, and high purity."

In other words, it was highly unlikely an inhaled aphrodisiac could have the effect Alexander just experienced.

Especially since he only caught a faint whiff.

A faint scent suggested low purity.

Alexander: "Given Lillian Lopez's capabilities, she couldn't get her hands on something like this."

"You mean... someone is behind her?"

"It's just a suspicion."

"What will you do? Confront her? Interrogate her?"

"No," Alexander clenched his jaw, enunciating each word, "I'm going to the police."

Sophia was stunned.
###Chapter 484
So soon?

The police responded swiftly.

Hotel management was notified and immediately dispatched staff to assist with the investigation.

Alexander Laurent's room was sealed off immediately.

Air samples were collected and preserved by professionals.

The hotel manager personally escorted them to the security room to review the footage.

The commotion in the hallway drew curious glances from several guests.

Well-trained hotel staff quickly dispersed the onlookers.

But the door next to Alexander's remained firmly shut.

Not even a single curious soul emerged.

Let alone the so-called "friend."

The more they hid, the more suspicious it seemed.

Lillian Lopez was completely oblivious to this.

Or perhaps, she was too panicked to think straight.

That was indeed the case.

Lillian paced back and forth in her room.

Nervous sweat coated her skin.

Her facial muscles twitched uncontrollably.

Her hands trembled incessantly.

Ever since returning to her room after knocking on Sophia Sullivan's door, she had been restless.

She waited over half an hour, but there was no movement next door.

Alexander Laurent seemed to have vanished into thin air.

Then, the police arrived.

Peering through the peephole at the uniforms, her legs gave way, and she collapsed to the floor.

Had someone called the police?

Who?

She tried to reassure herself it might not be about this.

But when Alexander emerged from Sophia's room and spoke with the police, her last shred of hope shattered.

He had actually called the police!

What should she do?

The police would definitely trace it back to her…

Her eyes fell on the phone on the bed, and she immediately snatched it up.

After hesitating for a few seconds, she dialed a number.

"Hello…"

At the same time, in the hotel security room.

"…Nothing? How is that possible?!"

The manager pushed the security guard aside and operated the computer himself.

Five minutes later—

He muttered dejectedly, "…There's really nothing… We just had camera maintenance last month. This shouldn't be happening…"

There was a young man on the police team with a background in computer science.

He spotted the issue immediately. "It's not a camera malfunction. The signal receiver was interfered with, causing the footage to freeze and the monitoring to fail."

The manager broke out in a cold sweat. "Then… what do we do?"

"Copy all the footage from the incident timeframe, whether it's intact or not, and hand it over to the police. Technicians will attempt to recover it later."

As for whether they would succeed, that was another matter.

The manager immediately promised his full cooperation.

…

"Failed?" Sophia was surprised by this result.

Alexander, however, remained calm, as if he had expected it all along.

The police finished collecting evidence and left first.

Whether a case would be formally opened required further notification.

The manager stayed behind to handle the aftermath. "Professor Laurent, my deepest apologies. We've prepared a new room for you on the second floor. Here is the key card."

Alexander accepted it.

Inside her room, Lillian watched the police leave through the peephole and let out a long sigh of relief.

She picked up her phone and dialed that number again—

"The police are gone."

"Tch— making a fuss over nothing." A man's light laugh came through.

"Are you sure they can't trace it? I knocked on the door and had hotel staff use a key card to open it! The police will definitely suspect me! If they open a case, then I…"

The more she spoke, the more frantic she became, starting to pace again.

The person on the other end, however, was eerily calm. "So what if they suspect you? As long as you keep your mouth shut, they have no evidence. They'll have to let you go eventually."

Hearing this, Lillian calmed down slightly.

"That drug… what exactly was it? You said it was highly pure and very potent, so why does Alexander seem perfectly fine?"

There was a brief silence on the other end. "You ask too many questions."

The woman frowned. "We are partners. Watch your tone."

"Heh… tone? The drug was mine. I arranged for it to be administered. And you? Take a shower, get naked, and sleep with Alexander Laurent?"

"Pity, you couldn't even manage that simple task, and you dare talk about partnership? Are you even worthy?"

The humiliating words made her furious. "Who are you? What do you want? Don't act so high and mighty! You wanted to use me against Alexander too! We were using each other! Neither of us is noble!"

"Tch! Idiot!"

After the insult, the call ended abruptly.

Lillian redialed. "Hello?! Explain yourself! Who are you calling an idiot?! Hello?!"

"The number you have dialed is not in service…"

Not in service?

Lillian stood frozen.

From hanging up to redialing, only几十秒 had passed. The SIM card had already been deactivated.

Just who was that person?

And that drug…

…

Alexander didn't go to the room on the second floor. He stayed with Sophia.

"…I should still go to the second floor."

Sophia put down the thermometer. "Do you want to see what your temperature is right now?"

"…"

"Why isn't the fever reducer working?" Sophia couldn't help but mutter.

Alexander sighed helplessly. "So soon?"

"Do you want some water? Something to eat? Or maybe some fruit?"

"Sophia, I don't need anything. Please, sit. Let's talk."

"Huh? Talk about what?" Sophia sat down, looking confused.

"Ahem! I saw everything earlier." A faint smile played on Alexander's lips.

"…Saw what?"

"You collecting the air samples."

Sophia: "…"

Nothing escaped his notice.

"I wanted to take them back to the lab for analysis, to see the specific components…"

She had entered Alexander's room and collected samples before the police arrived.

"Where did you get the collection tools?"

Sophia: "…I brought them with my luggage."

Alexander chuckled softly.

Coming to a summit and bringing professional tools— probably only she would do that.

"Ahem! Professor Watson mentioned we might visit F University and Stanford. I thought, maybe we could visit the labs? Bringing the tools was just being prepared…"

And it came in handy, didn't it?

…

Night fell, the moonlight cold and clear.

Alexander ultimately didn't leave.

Of course, he was also reluctant to go.

To prevent any issues in the middle of the night, Sophia planned to sleep on the nearby sofa to care for him.

But Alexander firmly objected.

He insisted on taking the sofa himself, letting Sophia have the bed. Otherwise, he would go stay in the second-floor room alone.

Unable to sway him, Sophia could only agree.

At 2 a.m., she was jolted awake by the sound of rapid, labored breathing.
###Chapter 485

Sophia Sullivan shot to her feet.

Alexander Laurent's eyes were tightly shut.

An unnatural flush colored his cheeks.

His breathing was heavy and rapid.

"Professor? Can you hear me?"

His eyelids fluttered.

But he couldn't open them.

"Alexander Laurent! Wake up!"

This time, he finally reacted.

His eyes snapped open.

"...Sophia?"

"You scared me to death..." She had just begun to relax.

Her wrist was suddenly seized.

A strong force yanked her forward.

Sophia tumbled into his embrace.

She was instantly stunned.

"Sophia..." His heavy breathing sounded above her head.

Through the thin layer of her pajamas.

Their bodies pressed tightly together.

His body heat was scorching, almost melting.

Alexander couldn't suppress a low groan.

Sophia's entire body went rigid.

She looked up, disbelief in her eyes.

He was actually...

The next second, she met his clouded gaze.

She had no time for shyness.

She pushed him back onto the bed.

Broke free from his grip.

Freed a hand to feel his forehead.

So hot!

"Alexander Laurent! Can you hear me?"

He continued to murmur, "Sophia... Sophia..."

Just two simple words.

Yet strangely intimate.

Paired with his ragged breathing.

It felt charged with desire.

Sophia's cheeks burned.

She lowered her eyes.

The sight that met them was even more stimulating.

His robe had fallen open.

Revealing a well-defined chest.

She hurriedly pulled his robe closed.

Tightened the belt.

The drug's effects hadn't subsided.

They were only temporarily suppressed.

They would come back with a vengeance.

This time, she didn't hesitate.

She took out her phone—

"Hello, 911..."

Alexander Laurent opened his eyes.

White ceiling.

The smell of disinfectant.

"Professor, you're awake."

A familiar voice spoke.

He turned his head.

Met Sophia's worried gaze.

He was stunned for a moment.

Then quickly realized he was in the hospital.

He smiled wryly.

Even without memory.

He could guess what had happened.

He had overestimated himself.

He hadn't been able to withstand the drug.

"...You were burning up in the middle of the night, delirious, and I couldn't wake you. I was afraid to give you the wrong medication, so I had to bring you to the hospital. How do you feel now?"

He nodded. "Much better. Thank you."

Sophia smiled. "You've helped me so many times. It's only right that I help you."

"I..." He hesitated.

"What is it?"

Alexander looked directly into her eyes. "I didn't do anything... out of control, did I?"

Images flashed through Sophia's mind.

The dim room.

Herself being pulled into his arms.

His ragged breathing.

The desire-filled murmurs of "Sophia"...

"No." She answered immediately, her tone firm.

Alexander let out a slight sigh of relief.

The doctor said he was fine.

He could be discharged by noon after finishing the IV.

The blood analysis Sophia had requested last night was ready for pickup.

She had also asked for a "Medical Report of Injury."

After being informed the police were involved.

The doctor promptly provided the relevant reports.

She kept copies of the test results and diagnosis.

She handed them to Alexander.

"These should be helpful for the case."

"That's very thorough. Thank you."

"Second time."

"Huh?"

"That's the second 'thank you' since you woke up."

"Well..." He scratched his head, displaying an uncharacteristic awkwardness. "I don't know what else to say..."

Sophia said seriously, "You could say: Let me treat you to a good meal."

"Okay. How about I treat you to hot pot?"

"!"

How did he know she was craving hot pot!

But...

"The doctor said you need a light diet."

"We can get a split pot."

"Deal!" Sophia agreed immediately.

It was already noon by the time the IV finished.

They went to complete the discharge procedures.

Sophia went to the pharmacy to get his medication.

Alexander went to get the doctor's stamp on the forms.

As the doctor stamped the papers, he peered over his glasses at him.

His look was meaningful.

Alexander: "...Is something wrong?"

"How's your throat?"

"My throat?"

"Any hoarseness? Or a dry throat?"

Alexander shook his head. "No."

"Oh, good. With all that calling out you did last night, I was worried about laryngeal edema..."

Alexander: "???"

"Doctor, last night... was I calling out loudly?"

"Not loud." The doctor shook his head. "It was constant. Non-stop."

Alexander's breath hitched. "What was I saying? What was I calling?"

The doctor glanced at him. "Relax. No strange noises. The words were normal. Don't get the wrong idea."

Alexander's tense nerves relaxed slightly.

His breathing returned to normal.

The doctor added—

"It was just 'Sophia, Sophia, Sophia,' over and over. Different tones and inflections. Your girlfriend was so embarrassed, her face was bright red..."

Alexander: "..."

Just kill me now.

Really.

Sophia returned with the medication.

She found Alexander standing outside the doctor's office.

He looked like a statue, completely stunned.

Only when she spoke—

"Professor? What's wrong?"

Did the man snap out of it. "...What did you say just now? Sorry, I was spacing out. I didn't hear."

"Did you get the stamp?" Sophia asked.

He nodded. "Got it."

"Let's go finish the discharge then."

As she spoke, Sophia reached out to support him.

But...

The man walked straight ahead. "Let's go. Hurry and get it done. Then we can go for hot pot."

Right, hot pot!

Sophia: "?"

She had a feeling Alexander seemed... afraid to look at her?

...

Discharge completed.

They found a hot pot place.

Although they ordered a split pot.

Alexander kept fishing things out of the spicy side.

"...What are you doing?" Sophia asked, amused and exasperated.

Alexander coughed awkwardly. "Who eats the plain side for hot pot... It's so boring..."

"Professor, I'm suddenly discovering you can be quite willful."

"Yeah, well, I'm being willful this once."

"..." She was speechless.

The next second, he placed seaweed shoots and cilantro meatballs in her bowl. "Eat more, Sophia."

The way he said "Sophia" made her pause.

Alexander: "What's wrong?"

"Nothing... nothing... The meatballs are good..."

They had bought tickets back for 5 PM.

Professor Eleanor Watson had returned with the main group earlier that morning.

After hot pot, they still had time before their flight.

They decided to go to the police station...
###Chapter 486

The police informed them the case was still under investigation.
Whether it would be formally filed was still undetermined.

This answer was expected.
Neither of them was surprised.

After submitting the hospitalization report and documentation, Alexander Laurent and Sophia Sullivan headed to the airport.

Their flight landed in Kyoto at 8 PM.

They took a taxi back to their apartment building.
They had a simple dinner at a familiar stall near the alley entrance.

After the meal, they went upstairs together.

Sophia took out her keys to unlock her door.
She suddenly turned to look at Alexander, who was unlocking his own door.

"Professor, how are you feeling now? Any discomfort?"

"Everything's normal."

Sophia nodded. "Remember to take your medicine on time. The doctor recommended at least three days."

"Alright."

They exchanged goodnights and entered their respective apartments.

Sophia enjoyed a comfortable hot shower.
She changed into her pajamas.
As usual, she read two research papers before turning off the light to sleep.

She fell asleep quickly.

Next door, Alexander finished unpacking and took a shower.
He had originally gone to bed.

Remembering Sophia's reminder, he sighed and got up.
He went to the living room and took his medicine.

Returning to bed, he found himself wide awake.

Perhaps he had slept too much at the hospital.
Or maybe it was the medication.
He was still completely alert at 1 AM.

Sophia's face kept appearing in his mind.

He finally fell asleep around 3 AM.
His dreams, however, became even more absurd.

He was back to that night with the herbal medicine...

The cold water in the tub couldn't suppress the inner heat.
The bathroom door suddenly swung open.

Under the dim light, a woman slowly approached.

She was completely naked!

Maintaining his last shred of rationality, he asked, "Do you know you're facing a drugged man?"

A delicate hand caressed his cheek.
###Chapter 487

The woman leaned in, her eyes seductive like a soul-stealing enchantress!

She said, "Let me be your antidote."

Boom—

All restraint shattered instantly.
He became a frenzied beast, devouring her whole.

"Sophia, don't blame me…"

At the final moment, he heard his own guilt-ridden murmur.

Then began a new round of conquest…

He lost count of how many times, or the positions.
Alexander woke up just before dawn.
The sheets were already damp and soiled.

Immense shame, accompanied by an indescribable sense of loss, nearly drowned him.

Furious, he jumped out of bed.
He stripped the sheets and duvet cover and threw them all into the trash.

Alexander Laurent, you absolute animal!

This low mood persisted until he left his apartment.
Coincidentally, the door across from his opened as well.

"Professor! Morning!" Sophia greeted him with a smile.

Her gaze fell on the bulging black trash bag in his hand.

The pattern of fabric was faintly visible at the opening.

If she remembered correctly, those were his bedsheets?

Alexander froze completely upon seeing her.
His eyes scanned the trash bag, and he nearly turned to stone.

He hurriedly muttered "Morning" and rushed downstairs first.

Yes, he ran.

Sophia: "?"

Was he going for a morning run?

…

Lillian Lopez had returned to Kyoto a day earlier than Alexander.

Whether out of guilt or a desire to avoid him, she had chosen to return with the larger group.

She didn't ask about Alexander's schedule.
Alexander didn't contact her either.

In the past, this would have upset her.
This time, however, she felt relieved.

Her parents asked about the summit when she got home.

Lillian left with a few words.
She excused herself by saying she was tired and retreated to her room.

The moment she put down her luggage, she was so scared she cried.
But she didn't dare make a sound.

The next day, Lillian was "sick."

She sent a leave email to Alexander's mailbox.
She didn't go to the lab for seven consecutive days.

When Dr. Zoe Langley and Quincy Evans asked, Alexander told them the truth.

"...Sick?"

"What kind of illness? Is it serious?"

Alexander expressionlessly stated, "I don't know," and turned to the实验台.

His shadow was cold and stern.

Quincy frowned.
Based on years of working together—

There was something wrong!

But it involved a lab member's private matter, so he couldn't pry further.

He suppressed his doubts and continued working.
His attitude was much more serious than usual.
He stopped joking around.

Dr. Zoe Langley wasn't as perceptive.

She genuinely thought Lillian was seriously ill.
Unable to get information from Alexander, she went to ask Simon Lowell.

"...Do you think Quincy and I should buy some fruit and visit? We've worked together for so many years, we're practically family."

Simon was stunned from the moment he heard "Lillian is sick."

Lillian was sick?
And she had asked the professor for leave?
Why hadn't she said anything to him?
She wasn't answering his calls either…

It had been three days since Lillian returned.
Simon's calls either went to voicemail or couldn't connect.

He sent messages every day on WeChat and QQ.
There was never any response from the other end.

Lillian seemed to have vanished from the face of the earth!

He had been frantic with worry these past two days, afraid something had happened to her.
He tried contacting her family.

He found that after nearly a year of dating, he didn't even know her parents' names, let alone their contact information.

Anxiety and worry kept Simon up all night.
He lost five pounds in two days.
Dark circles under his eyes made him look pale and haggard.

"...Simon? Simon!"

"Ah? Zhao姐, what did you say just now?"

"You look terrible. Is your mother's condition still not stable? I heard she was hospitalized last time. Is she out now?"

"Sh-she's out. Thank you for your concern, Zhao姐. I'm fine."

"That's good. Your mom just got better, and now Lillian is having issues. You've really been through a lot…"

Simon forced a dry laugh.
His mother wasn't sick at all.
He had lied to give his summit spot to Lillian.

As for Lillian being sick…
He had no information at all.
If Dr. Zoe Langley hadn't mentioned it, he might still be in the dark.

Dr. Zoe Langley: "So, do you think Quincy and I should…"

"No need. It's nothing serious. She'll be back in a few days. No need to make a big deal out of it."

"Alright, if you say so. You're a couple after all. Your word is as good as hers."

Simon nodded hurriedly.

Two more days passed.
He didn't wait for Lillian's return.
Instead, he received news that she had been fired.
Morning light filtered through the gap in the curtains.

Simon Lowell's first act upon waking was to reach for his phone.

The screen lit up. No missed calls.

There were a few new messages on WeChat. None were from Lillian Lopez.

He got out of bed, feeling dejected, and went to wash up. He hurried to the lab.

His phone rang just as he reached the door.

The caller ID made his heart race—

"Lil! Where have you been these past few days? I called so many times…"

"Simon, are you for real?"

He froze.

"I'm not answering calls or replying to messages because I don't want to talk to you. Is that not obvious enough? Calling and texting non-stop, when will you stop?"

"I was just worried about you…"

"I don't need it! Stop stalking me, okay? I need personal space!"

The call ended abruptly.

Simon stood there, phone in hand, stunned.

"Watch out!" Dr. Zoe Langley steadied an instrument he'd almost knocked over.

Simon finally snapped out of it.

"Let's go to the conference room." Zoe patted his shoulder. "Professor Laurent called a meeting for ten."

They walked into the conference room one after the other.

Professor Quincy Evans and Alexander Laurent were already seated.

Alexander's gaze swept over Simon, holding an unreadable depth.

"Everyone's here. Let's get straight to the point."

Alexander was direct. "Effective immediately, the lab is terminating its contract with Lillian Lopez."

The room fell silent.

Quincy was the first to react. "Professor, is there some misunderstanding?"

Zoe hesitated. "Is it because Lillian is sick?"

Alexander offered no explanation. He continued assigning work. "Simon will take over Lillian's projects. Complete the handover promptly."

Simon's mind went blank.

He only snapped back to reality when Zoe nudged him under the table.

"Professor, why?"

Alexander looked at him. He said nothing. He stood up and left.

The lab atmosphere remained heavy all morning.

Simon picked up his phone several times to call Lillian. Each time, he hesitated and put it down.

He had an inkling of the reason.

Meanwhile, Lillian was at home, staring blankly at her computer screen.

The "Contract Termination" email hit like a sledgehammer.

She shot up and rushed out the door.

At the lab's main entrance, her fingerprint and iris scan both failed.

"Alexander Laurent! Open the door!"

"Let me in!"

"Simon! I know you're in there!"

Inside the lab, Simon was restless.

He looked at Alexander. "Professor, let her in... At least let her have an explanation."

Alexander gave him a long, deep look.

"You go open the door."

Simon walked to the door, relieved.

He had no idea this decision would become one he deeply regretted.
###Chapter 488

Lillian Lopez stormed into the lab.

She marched straight up to Alexander Laurent.

"Why was I fired?"

"Because I took a sick day? Or was there an issue with the project data?"

Alexander looked up.

He let out a soft, sudden laugh.

"Just because the police couldn't find proof, doesn't mean I don't know who did it. Should I make all the details public? Let everyone hear them?"

Lillian's face went pale.

Her last shred of hope shattered completely.

So he had known all along.

He had just waited until now to act.

She felt like an invisible hand was choking her.

All her anger lodged in her chest, suffocating her.

Zoe Langley opened her mouth to speak.

But her eyes met Alexander's icy gaze.

She instantly understood the situation was serious.

Connecting it to the conversation just now.

A startling suspicion formed in her mind.

Her look at Lillian shifted from sympathy to shock.

Quincy Evans had already guessed.

That's why he remained silent.

Only Simon Lowell was still in the dark.

He stepped forward to support Lillian.

He began, "Lil—"

"Get away from me!"

Lillian shoved him away violently.

She fled in a panic.

The stares from Zoe and Quincy felt like needles in her back.

They must have all figured it out!

Simon looked at his now empty hand.

He didn't look up for a long time.

Alexander turned and walked toward the lab bench.

Suddenly—

"Professor, can you give everyone an explanation?"

Simon spoke too quickly.

Quincy couldn't stop him in time.

Alexander turned around slowly.

Simon pressed, "There must be a reason for firing Lillian. What exactly did she do wrong?"

Alexander smiled.

The sympathy in his eyes turned into a cold, sharp blade.

"Simon, you've gone from undergrad to PhD. Your IQ shouldn't be a problem."

"?"

"Some things can't be smoothed over by playing dumb. Someone with a higher education should, at the very least, understand right from wrong."

"There's no need to spell everything out. Forcing a confrontation doesn't hurt pride; it wounds dignity."

After speaking, Alexander took off his lab coat.

He strode out of the lab.

Simon stood frozen in place.

Quincy pointed at him, exasperated.

"Alex was saving your face! Did you have to smear shit on everyone? But don't forget, your own hands got dirty first!"

He left in a huff.

Zoe sighed.

Her look at Simon was both pitying and mocking.

"I don't believe you couldn't see Lillian was keeping you as a backup! You were the donkey, and the Professor was the thoroughbred she wanted!"

"Too bad the thoroughbred wasn't interested. So she just rode you, her stupid donkey, into battle. And in the end, even the donkey got sold off!"

"If you really want to know the reason, go ask your girlfriend."

Zoe left too.

How could such a smart person become such an idiot when in love?

His phone suddenly rang.

Simon looked at the intimate nickname on the screen.

He remembered the disgust in her eyes when she shoved him away.

He hesitated for the first time.

But he still answered the call.

A woman's voice came through—

"You didn't even come after me? Simon Lowell, do you even care about me?!"

After a long pause, he finally spoke. "...Where are you?"

Lillian snapped, "The coffee shop by the campus gate. Get here in five minutes."

Simon grunted in agreement.

It took him fifteen minutes to get there.

Lillian sat with her arms crossed. "Why are you so late? I hate waiting!"

"Yeah. Sorry." Simon looked down.

His pathetic demeanor infuriated her.

He was inferior to Alexander Laurent in every way.

But remembering he still had his uses, she suppressed her anger and forced a weak smile.

"Can you talk to the Professor for me? Ask him to reverse the termination?"

Simon suddenly looked up.

He studied her with an unfamiliar gaze.

Lillian nervously averted her eyes.

"Are you going to help or not? If not, forget it…"

This line always made Simon agree immediately before.

But this time, he was silent for a long time…

"Okay."

He finally agreed.

Lillian just started to relax.

But Simon continued, "But you have to tell me why the Professor fired you."

"What… what's there to say…"

"What if I insist on knowing?"

Lillian frowned.

She felt her authority was being challenged.

Her face immediately darkened—

"Simon Lowell, are you blackmailing me? You don't love me at all if you can't even do this one little thing!"

Listening to her accusations.

Simon half-lowered his eyes, his expression unreadable.

Lillian sneered. "Why ask so many questions? If you don't want to be together, just break up. It's not like you…"

"Okay."

Lillian was stunned. "...What did you say?!"

Simon slowly raised his head.

He called her name one last time. "Lillian."

Her heart tightened. "You…"

"I agree to break up."

Lillian was dumbfounded. "You… what do you mean?"

"Isn't this what you wanted? I'm agreeing."

"Simon Lowell! You look down on me because I got fired? I never thought you were so shallow!"

"Heh…"

"W-What are you laughing at?"

Simon enunciated each word clearly. "In your eyes, I must be very stupid, right? So stupid you didn't even bother to敷衍 me? You played me for a fool, used me like a workhorse, and now you're throwing me away like trash?"

"I—"

"The reason you can't say it, everyone else already knows. But I'm not a real idiot."

Lillian was speechless.

Simon wanted to laugh, but it looked more like crying. "I should have seen it sooner. Your heart belonged to someone else. But I always thought I could change things if I tried hard enough. It turns out, some people's hearts can't be warmed. So Lillian—"

"I'm letting go. You're free."

With that, Simon stood up and left.

He stopped at the counter to pay the bill on his way out.

Lillian watched his retreating back.

Her lips trembled, but no words came out.

After a long moment, she slumped back into her chair.

She murmured, lost, "How did it come to this…"

She thought she had him firmly in her grasp, but just like that… he was gone.
###Chapter 489

Late May, Isabella Sullivan flew to the city for an IP film launch event.

It was the weekend. David Sullivan accompanied his wife and brought a large package of sliced marinated beef and six jars of handmade pickled vegetables for Sophia.

"All natural, no additives! Remember to share some with Alexander. Don't eat it all yourself."

He left in a hurry.

The organizers covered all accommodations. Since the launch venue was far from the Atlante family home, the couple chose to stay at a hotel.

They still set aside an afternoon to visit Isaac and Florence Atlante and have dinner with them.

The elderly couple knew their daughter was busy, and their son-in-law... was equally busy. They didn't insist they stay overnight.

In a few days, after Isaac finished some tasks, the old couple would leave for a nearby city to escape the summer heat.

They lived in the same neighborhood. There would be plenty of chances to meet.

Sophia watched her father's retreating figure, then looked at the pile of marinated beef.

She divided half into another bag and added three jars of pickled vegetables, waiting for Alexander Laurent to return so she could give it to him.

By eleven at night, she had finished reading three research papers and was ready for bed. There was still no sound of a door opening across the hall.

Worried she might miss him, she went over and knocked.

"Professor, are you home?"

No answer.

He was probably pulling another all-nighter at the lab.

Sophia wasn't concerned. She spent plenty of time in the lab herself these days. Caleb Watson practically lived there.

Hannah Morse had joked, "Just add a couple of wardrobes. If Sophia brings some cooking utensils, it'll be just like home."

A few days later, Caleb actually found a second-hand wardrobe and placed it in the break room.

"It's neater this way. The clothes won't be as messy."

He never used to care about such things.

So what if it was messy? As long as the clothes were wearable.

But now there were two women in the lab, and Marcus Lawrence was particularly fastidious. He felt he shouldn't be too sloppy.

As time passed, Hannah noticed—

"Has Caleb become more handsome?"

It was simply washing his hair more often, changing clothes regularly, and smiling more.

Caleb had decent features to begin with. With a little effort, his natural presence emerged.

Marcus Lawrence heard this but said nothing.

The next day, however, he showed up with a new hairstyle and a rare trench coat.

Hannah exclaimed, "Did you get a perm?"

Marcus nodded. "Yes."

"The classic fuckboy look!"

"??"

Caleb passed by and casually added, "Fuckboy perm."

Marcus raised an eyebrow. "I know."

He then walked away calmly.

The next day, he quietly returned to his original hairstyle.

Hannah nodded. "This looks much better."

The corner of Marcus's mouth lifted slightly. He thought to himself: This will be the hairstyle from now on.

Caleb looked at the ends of Marcus's hair, secretly envious.

All that styling must have cost a fortune.

Back to the main point. Sophia had to move the marinated beef to a corner of the living room for easy retrieval later.

For seven full days, Sophia spent three nights at the lab and four at home, but never saw any sign of Alexander.

Even his parking space in the garage remained empty.

Sophia frowned.

Had his old condition flared up again? Was he back in the hospital?

She immediately texted Alexander—

[Professor, my father brought some marinated beef. There's a portion for you.]

[When will you be home? I'll give it to you.]

[Image]

Alexander replied promptly—

[Please thank your father for me. I've been staying at the lab recently.]

Sophia felt slightly relieved. At least he wasn't hospitalized.

[The air sample analysis report is out.]

She sent the file directly to Alexander.

This time, there was no immediate reply.

After her shower, Sophia saw a WeChat message from ten minutes ago.

She opened it—

Alexander: [It largely matches the police report. No hallucinogenic or aphrodisiac components were detected.]

This was also the main reason the police investigation concluded with "no case to answer."

The police indeed did not file a case.

Alexander had waited several days before firing Lillian Lopez, precisely to await the police response.

If a case had been filed, Lillian would have faced more than just dismissal.

This was what puzzled Sophia.

Alexander's reaction that day was definitely not feigned. Yet the component analysis showed nothing. There was only one explanation—

Certain aphrodisiac components had dissipated before the samples were collected.

And they had dissipated to a degree undetectable by current technology.

Such drugs simply didn't exist on the market.

Sophia: [Is a phone call convenient to discuss details?]

A moment later, Alexander called.

Sophia answered and outlined her theory: "...This person has access to new drugs. They must have connections and resources. Professor, you must be careful."

"Okay."

With the serious matter concluded, silence fell between them.

"...Professor," Sophia spoke first, "Are you not coming home to stay these days?"

There was a brief silence on the other end: "...No."

"Alright. Get some rest. Don't stay up too late. Goodnight."

Although Alexander's reaction seemed normal, not obviously avoiding her like last time, Sophia still sensed a certain evasiveness in his words.

She walked onto the balcony, letting the cool night breeze wash over her. A smile touched her lips, not fading.

Though she wondered why the man was avoiding her, Sophia never bothered herself with such worries.

To be precise, after going through that emotional ordeal with Ethan Roscente, she no longer felt anxious over men.

Even if she guessed Alexander might be shy or embarrassed;

Even if they had shared such an ambiguous moment;

Even if she herself felt... a strange flutter of emotion for Alexander;

Even if she saw the hidden admiration in his eyes;

So what?

If a man doesn't take the initiative to confess, should a woman lower her head and declare her love?

The old Sophia never would.

The current Sophia was even less likely.

A flower blooming in place naturally attracts bees and butterflies. If one doesn't come, others will.

Sophia remembered a line she saw online that felt quite right—

Anyone standing under a cherry blossom tree looks beautiful. Honey tastes sweet to anyone who tries it.

So, no need to overthink it. What is meant to come will come.

Right now...

Sleep was the most important thing!

She slept soundly through the night and woke at dawn.

Sophia got up and immediately started packing. For the next half month, she would be stationed at the lab.

Not just her. Hannah, Marcus, and Caleb all needed to go into seclusion. The reason—

A new research project had arrived!

By the time Alexander finished his week-long stay at the lab and returned, resolved to face Sophia, she was already long gone.
###Chapter 490

The rainy season arrived.

The weather turned abruptly.

It was sunny yesterday.

Today, it rained.

Alexander Laurent didn't have an umbrella.

He was drenched by the time he got home.

He took a hot shower.

Changed into his loungewear.

While drying his hair, he saw the bare mattress.

His movements paused briefly.

The bedding he'd thrown away that day.

He never replaced it.

He silently took out clean sheets and made the bed.

He remembered Sophia Sullivan mentioning it.

David Sullivan had sent pickles and beef.

He was supposed to go get them.

Alexander quickly dried his hair.

Changed out of his loungewear.

Went to knock on the door across the hall.

"Sophia, are you home?"

"...Sophia?"

No response.

He checked the time.

9 PM.

She should have been back from the lab by now.

For the next two hours.

Alexander was physically at home.

But his mind was out in the hallway.

He jumped up to check the peephole at every sound.

None of them were her.

1 AM.

Sophia still wasn't back.

She probably wasn't coming home tonight.

Alexander turned off the light and lay down.

He felt an empty hollowness inside.

He hadn't yet realized the severity of the situation.

The next day, he got up early as usual and went to the lab.

Came home in the evening to change for his night run.

From 8 to 10 PM.

He ran back and forth in the alley downstairs.

Never saw Sophia.

He waited another hour.

Ran into a few neighbors.

"Running again, Alex?"

"Such great health! You'll definitely win the marathon this year!"

"You and Sophia are the only runners in our building. I should get my son to learn from you! Speaking of, haven't seen Sophia today?"

Alexander's expression shifted slightly.

"She hasn't come back yet."

"Right, she's been really busy lately. She had time last week, but you weren't around…"

"Me?" Alexander was surprised.

"Yeah, Sophia looked for you a few times. Had a big bag with her too."

His heart clenched.

He turned and went upstairs.

Pulled out his phone and opened WhatsApp as he walked.

[Sophia, are you home?]

Ten minutes passed.

Then half an hour.

An hour later, a reply finally came.

[Is there something you need, Professor?]

Alexander: [Going for a run. Do you have time?]

Sophia: [Staying at the lab recently. Not coming home.]

Familiar words.

Last time, he had said them to her.

Now she was returning them verbatim.

The boomerang hit him right between the eyes.

A long time passed.

Before Alexander typed a response.

[Okay. Get some rest. Good night.]

Sophia didn't reply again.

That night, Alexander tossed and turned.

He didn't fall asleep until 2 AM.

…

Early morning.

Hannah Morse yawned as she got up.

Washed up, got ready, ate breakfast.

An hour later, she appeared in the lab area.

"Sophia—why are you still at the bench?"

Hannah froze in place.

Eyes wide.

Sophia smiled at her.

"Morning."

"Don't tell me you pulled an all-nighter." Hannah's voice was flat.

Good heavens!

She thought she was hardworking enough.

She went into the break room at 10 PM last night.

Got up at 8 AM when her alarm went off.

Didn't laze in bed at all!

And yet someone was even more diligent!

Wait.

Sophia had always been this diligent!

Ugh!

"What are you thinking about?" Sophia laughed.

"I'm not made of iron. Why would I pull an all-nighter if the task isn't urgent? For fun?"

"Right, right! Then how did you…"

"Just got up a little bit earlier than you."

Hannah breathed a sigh of relief.

Giggled.

Asked casually.

"How much is a little bit?"

"Well…" Sophia checked her watch.

"Two hours."

Hannah: "…" Stupid mouth! Why did you have to ask!

Marcus Lawrence walked out from the testing lab across the hall.

Holding samples and a report.

"You… you…" Hannah was speechless.

"When did you get up?"

Marcus told the truth.

"6 AM. Why?"

Hannah: "…"

Fine.

She was the only one who slept until 8.

Ugh…

The entire morning.

She channeled her guilt into productivity.

Her efficiency was remarkably high.

Lunchtime.

She finally exhaled deeply and stepped away from the bench.

They were all working in seclusion.

The lab had pots, pans, and utensils.

The fridge had ready-to-cook ingredients.

But no one was cooking.

Sophia had pre-ordered meals.

Three meals a day were delivered.

Hannah only took one bite.

And knew it was from "Le Goût Authentique."

Not cheap.

Caleb Watson didn't know "Le Goût Authentique."

He just thought the food was especially fragrant.

The rice was a long-grain variety.

He finished three bowls in one go.

Put down his chopsticks, drank a glass of water.

And went back into the lab area.

Hannah, who had just gotten into her groove: "??"

Why is everyone grinding so hard?

She's fat.

She doesn't want to move.

She wants to die!

Afternoon.

Sophia completed her second model test.

Changed clothes and prepared to go out.

"Sophia, where are you going?"

"Meeting with the domestic agent for the new equipment. Discussing pricing."

Hannah's eyes lit up.

"Our lab is getting new equipment again?"

Sophia nodded.

"If the discussion goes well."

"Great, great, go ahead. Remember an umbrella, the weather's been bad lately, always raining."

Sophia nodded in agreement.

Went to the storage room but couldn't find an umbrella.

Glanced outside.

It wasn't raining.

She left just like that.

Met the agent at a nearby coffee shop.

Not far.

Sophia didn't drive.

The other party was already waiting in the shop when she arrived.

Upon seeing her, they immediately stood up with a smile and came forward.

"Miss Sullivan, hello."

Sophia looked at the short-haired, efficient, well-spoken woman before her.

Reached out and shook her hand.

"Hello, Manager Wang."

"I'm Wang Jingjing, you can call me Jingjing if you like."

"Okay, Jingjing. Then please don't call me Miss Sullivan. Sophia Sullivan, my name."

"I know, Mr. Evans introduced your name when he recommended your contact. Come, Sophia, let's sit and talk…"

Wang Jingjing was very talkative.

Every sentence hit the key points.

Not a single wasted word.

It didn't feel noisy.

Sophia spoke little.

Mostly listened to the other party.

Wang Jingjing: "…You see, this price is really the bottom line I can offer."

Sophia smiled.

Met the woman's sincere gaze.

She spoke unhurriedly.

"Usually, when a sentence ends with an emphatic word, it means there's still room for negotiation in what was said before. Don't you think so, Jingjing?"
###Chapter 491

The woman paused, then chuckled softly.
"You caught me... Alright, I'll give another 0.1 percent. That's the absolute lowest."
Sophia Sullivan: "0.3. My final offer."
Wang Jingjing stopped moving.
Sophia set down her coffee cup and stood.
The liquid in the cup was just finished.
"It seems we can't reach an agreement today. I hope we can cooperate in the future."
She turned to leave.
Wang Jingjing, startled by her decisive attitude, quickly stood up.
"Don't be hasty, the price can be discussed..."
Sophia stopped and looked back.
"I don't like beating around the bush. 0.3. Sign now, or I'm returning to the lab."
Wang Jingjing hesitated for a moment.
Watching Sophia really about to leave, she finally gritted her teeth.
"...Fine!"
A slight smile touched Sophia's lips.
"Pleasure doing business."
After signing the contract and confirming the equipment delivery time and installation details, Sophia got up to leave.
"Miss Sullivan—" Wang Jingjing called out to her.
Sophia turned back.
"Has anyone ever told you you're a great negotiator?"
She clearly wanted the equipment badly, yet she acted like she could walk away at any moment.
Only after the contract was signed did Wang Jingjing realize it, but it was too late.
Sophia: "No."
Wang Jingjing: "I don't believe that."
"But I understand one principle."
"What?"
"Whoever concedes first, loses."
After saying that, she turned and left, leaving the woman standing there stunned.
Over a decade in sales, and today she got schooled by an amateur!

...

The weather changed abruptly.
As Sophia stepped out of the café, a light drizzle had begun to fall.
There was a bus stop next to it, perfect for sheltering from the rain.
Judging by the rain, it wouldn't stop anytime soon. Walking back to the lab wasn't realistic.
Sophia took out her phone to call a ride.
Just then, a white BMW 5 Series slowly pulled up in front of her.
The window rolled down, revealing a sunny, smiling face—
"Sophia! I thought I was seeing things. It really is you."
"Young Master Omelas? What a coincidence."
Omelas Lingshuo smiled. "Get in first. This rain won't stop soon. Where are you headed? I can give you a lift?"
Sophia glanced at the queue notification on her ride-hailing app.
She pulled the car door open and got in.
"Thank you. Straight ahead, then left turn. It's about a kilometer."
"Alright." Omelas Lingshuo shifted gears, signaled, and merged onto the main road.
"What are you doing here?"
Sophia: "Had a meeting with someone."
"Oh oh! You... have you been very busy lately?"
"Yes."
He muttered quietly, "...No wonder you didn't reply to my messages..."
"What?"
"Nothing! I was asking... you don't usually post on social media?"
Sophia: "Occasionally."
"I see..."
Omelas Lingshuo wanted to keep making conversation, but the distance was too short. They arrived quickly.
He parked the car under the awning in front of the lab.
Sophia: "Thank you."
She pushed the door open to get out.
Suddenly—
"Wait!"
She turned back.
Omelas Lingshuo got out of the car and hurried after her. "You dropped something..."
He opened his palm. It was Sophia's earring.
She raised her hand to touch her earlobe. One was indeed missing.
"Thank you."
She took the earring from the man's palm.
The moment her fingertips brushed his skin, Omelas Lingshuo stiffened all over.
A tingling sensation, like a mild electric shock.
A strange and novel feeling.
Sophia took the earring, thanked him, and walked away while putting it back on.
"Miss Sullivan—"
"Is there something else?"
Omelas Lingshuo began to stammer. "I... could I treat you to a meal? Tonight... if you're busy, another day works too..."
Sophia was puzzled. "Why treat me to a meal?"
"Well..." Omelas Lingshuo was at a loss for words, but quickly found a reason.
"My cousin said the study guide you gave her was very helpful. She insisted I must treat you to dinner to thank you! Yes, to thank you!"
"Sorry, I have work..." She pointed to the lab. "I'm swamped recently. Not sure when I'll be free."
"Then..."
"I need to go in now." Sophia interrupted him and quickly walked away.
Omelas Lingshuo looked at the sign by the door and read it softly—
"Boundless Lab..."
He got back into his car and immediately searched for information on his phone.
"Establishment date... Founder... Academic publications..."
He knew Sophia was outstanding—a grad student at MIT, got in on her own merit—but he hadn't realized she was this impressive!
Built her own lab, leading a team developing new research, multiple papers published, high impact factors...
He was engrossed, a smile unconsciously forming on his lips, when a black Volkswagen suddenly cut in front of his car.
It was speeding, and it honked loudly.
"What the..."
There was no car in front, his car wasn't moving, and he wasn't blocking the way. Why so aggressive?
Omelas Lingshuo muttered "weird" and continued looking at the information on his phone.
The smile returned to his lips, growing wider and wider.

...

Back in the lab, Sophia changed into dry clothes.
She made a cup of ginger tea to ward off the chill.
"Sophia, did it work out?" Miaomiao asked with a smile, leaning in, her chubby cheeks propped in her hands like a flower.
Sophia: "The equipment arrives early next month."
"Ahhh! Amazing! How much did they concede?"
"0.3 percent."
"!!"
Previously, when they asked Sebastian Evans, he said the highest discount he could get was only 0.1.
Sophia went to negotiate with the general agent herself.
Miaomiao thought at most 0.2, but she got 0.1 more!
"Sophia," Miaomiao said solemnly, grasping her hand, eyes full of admiration, "you are my goddess!"
"Pfft—" Sophia was amused. "Alright, how many sets of data are out? Enough for the sampling test volume?"
Miaomiao instantly deflated. "Only... two sets. I'll go check on it right now! I promise two more sets before dark!"
After saying that, she immediately ran back to the experiment station.
Sophia shook her head with a light laugh.
She put on her lab coat and returned to the experiment area.
She saw a neatly compiled set of documents on the table, exactly what she had asked Miaomiao to gather yesterday.
After reading it, she nodded. "The data is very comprehensive, even includes international figures. Well done."
"Ah?" Miaomiao turned her head. "Sophia, what documents?"
Sophia waved the file in her hand. "This one."
"Oh, that wasn't me."
"?"
"Professor Laurent sent it over."
###Chapter 492
Sophia Sullivan froze. "Professor Laurent is here?"

"He arrived around two. Waited over an hour for you. Left about ten minutes ago when you still weren't back."

Ten minutes ago...

"Sophia, has the Professor been really busy lately? A new lab project? But the last one just wrapped up..."

How unsettling!

Sophia raised an eyebrow. "Why do you say that?"

"He looked... not great. Serious dark circles, like he pulled an all-nighter. Didn't smile much when we talked. His brow was furrowed so tight he could've crushed a mosquito."

A flicker of something crossed Sophia's eyes. "Maybe. The lab is always busy..."

Hannah Morse hesitated.

She had a strong feeling Professor Laurent was in a bad mood, too.

...

Alexander Laurent drove straight home, pulling into his garage.

The spot next to his was empty. She'd taken her car.

So if she drove, why was she in Zachary Wang's car?

Alexander climbed the stairs in silence.

His phone rang midway—Quincy Evans.

"...I swear I gave you the analysis report before leaving yesterday. I can't find it anywhere."

Alexander said nothing. This wasn't his problem to solve.

More frantic rustling came from the other end. "...It's really not here. I've checked every drawer and cabinet. I'll eat my hat if you find it here."

Alexander's voice was icy. "Are you suggesting I lost it?"

Quincy choked.

Okay, that possibility was nearly impossible.

Anyone might lose a report, but not Alexander Laurent.

He never made mistakes. He was practically a textbook.

Quincy felt insane for even suspecting him...

"Fine, I'll keep looking. I refuse to believe it's gone! I definitely saw it yesterday..."

Quincy muttered and hung up.

Alexander reached the seventh floor.

He took out his keys, opened the door, and paused while changing his shoes—

The missing analysis report was sitting right on the shoe cabinet.

He stared blankly for a moment, confusion in his eyes.

When did he bring this home?

No memory of it at all...

Annoyed, Alexander called Quincy back. "...It's here. I brought it home yesterday."

Silence for two seconds. "...You're kidding me, Alex?! What's going on? That's a mistake I'd make!"

"..."

"No comeback? Really hit a nerve?"

"..."

"Not that either? Then I can't think of anything else that would mess you up like this except little Sophia."

Alexander's breath hitched.

Quincy heard it immediately. "Whoa— This is about Sophia?"

"No!" Alexander snapped, then hung up in a fluster.

Quincy: "?"

If it's not, then why shout? So defensive...

Tsk!

"The old house is about to catch fire!"
###Chapter 493
Sophia Sullivan stayed in the lab for two full weeks.

The intensive project could have ended two days earlier.

But Hannah Morse seemed to have been struck by some sudden motivation.

She abruptly started grinding nonstop.

She strongly insisted on completing the Phase Two experimental plan as well.

Caleb Watson had no objections.

Being locked in or out made no difference to him anyway.

Marcus Lawrence, of course, listened to Hannah.

Sophia had no issues with it either.

So the group spent two extra days in the lab.

They finally finalized the initial experimental plan.

Hannah was brimming with fighting spirit.

She was terrifyingly strong right now.

However, on the day they wrapped up—

"Sophia, hehe~ I'm applying for my annual leave!"

So all that previous hard work was just preparation for the upcoming relaxation.

Sophia approved it directly. "Granted."

In the afternoon, Marcus Lawrence found her—

Sophia raised an eyebrow. "You want annual leave too?"

Marcus nodded. "Yes."

"??"

What was going on with them?

Considering everyone had worked hard these past two weeks.

Sophia decided to give everyone two days off.

A balance of work and rest is necessary for sustainable development—

"Especially you, Caleb. No overtime. I'll fine you if I catch you!"

Caleb: "?"

A boss who forces people to take time off?

He scratched his head. "Then... I'll go back home. It's about time to help harvest the corn, hehe..."

With the Xu father and son behind bars.

The local criminal elements in Lower Dam Village and the town were rounded up by the police.

All threats to the Watson family were eliminated.

Mr. Watson took Mrs. Watson back to the village.

The cherry orchard had already been leased to a contracting company.

The contract was signed, the money received. It couldn't be taken back.

But the Watsons still owned several plots of land in the village.

They had crops planted when they were forced to move.

Mr. Watson had to abandon them, which pained him deeply.

Fortunately, the Xu family was gone.

After village-wide crackdowns and ideological reforms, the atmosphere improved greatly.

Mr. Watson wanted to go back and manage those plots again.

The couple didn't move back permanently.

They just spent a few days each month returning from the city to work the land.

As Mr. Watson said: Might as well do something. Grow some food, self-sufficiency is enough.

He wouldn't actually want to move back for good.

His wife was going to a major hospital.

Famous doctors introduced by Alexander Laurent treated her.

Her health was visibly improving.

Their daughter had also adapted to her new school.

She excelled academically and was recently recommended for a math competition.

She achieved a very high ranking.

She's reportedly going to Beijing for a winter camp training session.

A gold medal could mean admission to MIT or Caltech.

As for himself.

His fresh soybean pudding was delicious and fairly priced.

It gradually gained a reputation in several nearby neighborhoods.

He later added savory tofu pudding.

Seeing more and more regular customers.

Chloe Sullivan Watson helped set up a WeChat group.

People could pre-order soybean pudding and tofu pudding.

Large orders qualified for home delivery.

It might seem like a small business, but the costs were low.

The soybeans were grown themselves.

He made several thousand dollars profit each month.

Such income was unimaginable to Mr. Watson before.

Mrs. Watson's health still didn't permit her to work outside.

But she wasn't idle.

She did housework and cleaning daily.

She also prepared three meals for her husband.

And helped make tofu.

Before Caleb returned to school, he bought her a smartphone.

It was Mrs. Watson's first time using such an advanced phone.

She went from being clumsy to gradually proficient.

She learned very diligently.

When Chloe Sullivan saw her mother had learned.

She handed over management of the "Watson Tofu" WeChat group to her.

At first, Mrs. Watson struggled due to slow typing and many typos.

But she gradually discovered she could use voice-to-text.

Later, a neighbor who ran a courier station told her about being a community group buying leader.

She could earn commission if people used her link to order.

With a try-it-out attitude.

Mrs. Watson periodically posted good group buy deals in the tofu group.

She didn't just throw an order link into the group for people to buy.

She would buy the items herself first to test and try them.

Only things with good quality and reasonable prices were shared.

She also included her own user experience.

And advised everyone to buy rationally.

And you know what! Believe it or not!

Those regular customers in the group actually listened to her!

From a few scattered orders to dozens, then hundreds.

Now her daily income was actually several hundred dollars.

This utterly shocked Mr. Watson.

He got up early every day to grind soy milk and prepare soybean pudding.

Then he had to carry it around to several neighborhoods hawking it.

The weather was getting warmer, hotter every day.

He came back drenched in sweat after each trip.

In the afternoon, he set up a stall selling tofu pudding at the square downstairs.

He only packed up and went home in the evening.

After all that, he didn't earn much more than his wife.

Mrs. Watson couldn't help but laugh.

"See! You sell muscle, I sell brains. I earn money easily."

"Wow, who taught you that? And that group buying and... what was it? Private domain traffic? Where did you learn these things?"

"Those two girls who came to our house last time, Caleb's classmates, remember?"

"Of course, I remember."

"The chubby one named Hannah, she added me on WeChat. I heard these things from her. She also recommended several books to me, said reading and learning more would definitely be rewarding."

"Since we moved to the city and don't do farm work anymore, I had nothing to do at home all day, so I bought those books to read. They're really useful, honestly..."

Mr. Watson sighed. "Our family owes them a lot, otherwise..."

"So I told our son to work hard and steadily."

"We should also invite that Hannah girl to dinner to thank her."

"Yes, yes," Mrs. Watson nodded quickly. "I told him the same thing."

So Caleb, before returning to his hometown.

Specifically invited Hannah—

"...My mom said it's all thanks to you. She insisted I treat you to dinner, said it's from her, representing her feelings."

"But..."

"You choose what to eat! Anything is fine!"

After spending this time together.

He knew Hannah was very particular about food.

Her palate was sharp; she could tell what was delicious and what wasn't.

"Alright." Hannah couldn't refuse and finally agreed.

She then rescheduled her morning plans with Marcus to noon.

Compressed her noon and afternoon plans together.

Freed up half a day.

Marcus thought she just wanted to sleep in and didn't ask further.

But then...

The next morning, when he saw the two of them sitting across from each other in the restaurant through the glass window.

Eating happily.

His face instantly darkened.

As black as a pot.

"Your braised chicken to go is ready—" The server cheerfully handed it over.

Marcus snorted: She's already eating! What's the point of takeout!

When Hannah arrived at their meeting place at noon.

She called Marcus—

"Where are you? I don't see you."

"...At home."

"What?! Say that again?!"

Marcus on the other end involuntarily shrank his neck. "...On my way."
###Chapter 494

Hannah hung up the phone.

She was barely satisfied.

Before, when they had dates, Marcus would always arrive early.

By the time she arrived, he would already have her favorite bubble tea and snacks ready.

But today…

Something was off.

When Marcus finally showed up, this feeling grew even stronger.

Hannah tilted her head, studying him, and blinked. "Are you upset?"

"...No."

"Liar! You're clearly upset. Who annoyed you?"

Marcus stared directly at her.

Hannah felt a chill under his gaze. "Why… are you looking at me like that?"

He averted his eyes, stubbornly insisting. "I'm not angry."

"You are!"

"I'm not!"

"You are!"

They stood arguing on the street like children.

Marcus: "...Then tell me, what part of me is upset?!"

"Every part! Your eyes, nose, mouth, eyebrows, hair, even your eyelashes are screaming that you're upset!"

Marcus: "..."

"And you didn't bring me bubble tea today!"

Marcus pursed his lips and muttered under his breath, "You were full from eating with someone else, how could you still drink bubble tea…"

Huh?

Huh huh huh??

"Marcus, that sounds loaded~"

Marcus snorted lightly, deliberately turning his head away from her.

Hannah's eyes darted. "Did you see me having lunch with Caleb today?"

"Hmph!!"

"Ah, let me explain… He made time to treat me before going back home, and it was his mother's wish. I couldn't really refuse."

"You didn't tell me." Marcus's voice was muffled.

"Why would I mention such a small thing? It doesn't affect our date. You didn't ask, so how could I bring it up?"

Marcus's expression immediately brightened. "Then… how was your meal with Caleb?"

Hannah thought back seriously. "The braised chicken was good, the hot pot platter was okay, but the best was the duck foot soup. It was stewed until tender and flavorful, melting in your mouth… Huh? Why are you smiling?"

The corners of Marcus's mouth turned up uncontrollably. "I… was smiling?"

"Yes! You're smiling right now!"

"Oh… Then, do you still want bubble tea? We can go buy some now."

Hannah's eyes instantly lit up. "Yes, yes!"

…

On the same leisurely holiday, Sophia got up, had breakfast, and started cleaning her room.

After tidying up, she changed clothes, did her makeup, and prepared to go out.

"Sophia, you're back—" The door opposite opened at the same time. Alexander was dressed in a casual suit, seemingly also heading out.

"Good afternoon, Professor." Sophia smiled and nodded.

Alexander smiled back. "Going out? Let's go downstairs together."

"Okay."

They greeted each other as if nothing had happened and walked side by side.

Alexander made no mention of waiting for the past half month.

Sophia remained equally composed.

But the atmosphere was ultimately different, and they walked in silence. Reaching the front of the building, Alexander noticed her turning the other way and finally spoke—

"Not going to the garage?"

Sophia smiled faintly. "Not driving today. Someone's picking me up."

The man's heart sank.

Who?

Sebastian?

Or… Zachary?

Alexander: "Isn't driving yourself more convenient?"

Sophia: "It's nice to ride in the passenger seat occasionally."

Alexander was speechless.

She spoke again. "I'll wait here for a bit. Professor, you can head to the garage first?"

"...Okay."

He wanted to stay but had no reason.

In the end, he could only leave first.

Sophia waited by the roadside for about five minutes before a bright yellow Ferrari stopped at the mouth of the alley, engine roaring.

Olivia leaned out of the driver's window and whistled. "Your Highness! Your carriage awaits!"

Sophia's face broke into a smile. "Coming—"

She got into the passenger seat and buckled her seatbelt. "You changed cars again?"

"No, it's Julian's."

"Oh~"

"What's with the 'oh'?" Olivia asked, exasperated.

"I'll 'oh' if I want. You just drive. Don't ask. If you ask, you already know the answer."

"Pfft~ Why do you sound like my brother now, all cryptic and roundabout?"

Mentioning Alexander, Sophia paused for a moment before quickly collecting herself and turning on the music.

Jay Chou's "Can't Speak Out" was playing:

I just can't say it, let her know.

Just those few simple words, I can't do it.

My whole heart is suspended in mid-air, I can only watch from afar…

Olivia didn't like this song and immediately skipped to the next one:

I expected you to fight for me, but you just gave up.

What kind of man are you?

What kind of man are you?

You still love her but don't dare to ask her to wait.

No difference, you just keep accepting your fate.

She'll meet a better man…

Olivia hummed along, swaying to the rhythm.

Sophia instinctively tightened her grip on the seatbelt. "Focus on driving!"

"Ahem!" Olivia immediately sat up straight. "Sorry, sorry! I've been crazy busy lately, got carried away for a second…"

"Sigh, Sophia, you have no idea how rough it's been. All-nighters, back-to-back shifts, no time even for the spa. Look at these dark circles, and these two zits…"

Sophia examined her closely. "It's fine. You're still beautiful."

Olivia: "Really?"

"I never lie."

Full marks for emotional support.

"En… I want to change my hairstyle. Wanna join?" Olivia asked.

Sophia: "Sure."

…

At a certain hair salon—

Tony gestured at the mirror. "Miss Lopez, want to try a bold color… How about this light blue? Like flowing light."

"The nebula purple next to it is nice too, very atmospheric."

Olivia was indecisive. "Sophia, help me choose?"

Sophia looked down at the color chart and pointed. "How about this milk tea color? Unique but not too loud."

Tony glanced at her. "This young lady has excellent taste. Milk tea color is versatile for daily wear, with a rose gold tone that looks premium. It leans reddish-brown indoors, more vibrant in sunlight. You can check the sample."

Olivia actually preferred more flamboyant colors, the bolder the better, but…

Reality didn't allow it.

Whatever…

"This one, then."

Coloring took a long time. Sophia only got a cut, no color or perm. After finishing, she sat on the sofa waiting for Olivia, pulling out her phone to read a thesis.

Suddenly, a surprised voice sounded above her—

"Miss Sophia! It really is you!"

Sophia looked up. Zachary's brilliant smile flashed before her eyes.
###Chapter 495

Sophia Sullivan gave a slight nod.

Zachary Wang quickly excused himself from his friends and strode over.

"You're here for a haircut too?"

"Yes."

"I… I mentioned wanting to treat you to a meal last time. Are you free today?"

Sophia: "I'm here with a friend."

"Hello, young master Wang~" Olivia Lopez waved with a laugh, one leg crossed over the other.

"Olivia? You know each other?"

Olivia nodded. "I'm that friend."

"Perfect then. My treat after your hair is done?"

Olivia blinked. "I'm just the plus-one, right? You really want to invite someone else."

Zachary cleared his throat softly. "We're all friends… It's the same…"

Olivia glanced subtly at Sophia.

Are you going?

Sophia gave a slight shake of her head.

Olivia: "My hair will take a while, and we've already booked a restaurant. Sorry, Zachary."

Zachary immediately replied, "No problem! I can wait and join you!"

Olivia wagged a finger. "Girls' night. No boys allowed. Got it?"

"I see…" Zachary scratched his head. "Next time then."

Olivia: "Sure thing."

She thought he would leave.

Instead, he sat down next to Sophia.

"Sophia… Is it okay to call you that?"

"…Yes."

The man smiled. "The place I dropped you off last time was a lab, right?"

"Yes."

"I majored in Materials Chemistry in college. It's a different field from Biology, but there's some overlap…"

Zachary had clearly done his homework.

Knowing Sophia was focused on academia, he deliberately steered the conversation toward professional topics.

He avoided her specialty in biology and talked more about materials chemistry.

Sophia was initially uninterested.

But as she listened, she began to glance his way—

"You said you have a new materials R&D company? Is it lab-based?"

Zachary's eyes lit up. "Not purely a lab, but we have an R&D department."

His expression made Olivia shake her head repeatedly.

Sophia: "Which main areas do you develop?"

"Both electronics IT and biomedical. Things like integrated circuits, semiconductors, nanoscale drug carriers, and biosensors."

Sophia sat up a little straighter. "Could you elaborate on the materials for biosensors?"

"Of course! Currently, mature technologies include photodiodes and photoresistors, plus quantum dots. Research areas include thermistors, piezoelectric ceramics…"

Sophia listened intently.

Zachary spoke with growing excitement.

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, bathing them both.

The young man was passionate and energetic.

The woman was elegant and composed.

Strangely harmonious.

Even well-matched.

Olivia found herself staring.

Almost without thinking, she took out her phone, aimed at the two, and pressed the shutter.

So beautiful! This could be a screensaver.

She saved it delightedly.

Half an hour later, their hair was done.

Olivia called to Sophia, "Let's go, baby."

Zachary stopped talking, looking at them reluctantly.

Actually, he was looking at Sophia.

"Zachary, we'll be going then—"

"Join us for dinner?" Sophia suddenly said with a smile. "We have the reservation anyway."

"R-really? Is it okay?"

He was so excited he nearly stammered.

Olivia: "?" Are you serious?

Sophia gave a subtle nod.

"Alright," Olivia waved a hand. "Let's go. One more person just means an extra set of chopsticks."

Zachary followed happily.

At the restaurant, the server led them to a private room.

While waiting for the food, Zachary suddenly spoke up—

"Since we're just sitting here, how about I perform a magic trick for you both?"

Olivia raised an eyebrow. "You do magic? You showed off a bit at the Atlante birthday banquet last time."

Zachary: "This one is newly learned."

"Go on, then." Olivia enthusiastically took out her phone to record. "Do you need props?"

Zachary looked around, grabbed a pack of tissues from a side cabinet, and opened it.

He pulled out five tissues.

Each had a different printed pattern.

He looked at Sophia. "Pick one you like."

Sophia randomly selected one.

He took it, folded it, then unfolded it, showing it clearly to both of them.

Then he crumpled it into a ball in his palm.

When he slowly pulled it out again, it had transformed into a flower!

"For you." Zachary smiled, offering the flower to Sophia.

"…A real flower?" Sophia took it, examining it closely, somewhat surprised.

Olivia put her phone away. "Hey, how come I don't get one?"

Zachary's ears turned red. "Sorry, I only prepared one…"

He glanced secretly at Sophia, only to find she had placed the flower aside after looking at it.

Her expression was calm, unreadable.

He couldn't help but feel disappointed.

Fortunately, the server began bringing the food.

Olivia posted the video she just took to her social feed with the caption: Got to see a magic show. Nice~

She tossed her phone aside and started eating.

It was already 2 PM by the time they finished.

Zachary insisted on paying the bill. Olivia didn't argue.

"Zachary's loaded. One meal is nothing, right?"

Zachary nodded immediately. "Yeah! It's only right for the gentleman to pay. Besides…"

He looked at Sophia, hesitantly. "I wanted to treat Sophia to a meal anyway. Finally got the chance."

Sophia smiled. "You're too kind, Zachary. I should be thanking you."

Over the meal, she had figured out the scope of Zachary's company's business.

She already had some ideas.

She needed to discuss it with Hannah and Marcus when she got back.

Zachary left, feeling both excited and let down.

His emotions were mixed.

Olivia watched the car drive away and clicked her tongue softly, sighing. "The stream has intent, but the fallen flower is heartless~"

Sophia withdrew her gaze. "Weren't we going shopping?"

"Yes! Let's go, let's go!"

They got in the car and settled in.

Olivia took out her phone to set the navigation.

"Holy—"

10 missed calls. 42 unread messages.

Sophia fastened her seatbelt. "What's wrong?"

Olivia started checking them. "So many missed calls. Sophia, you drive. I need to reply."

"Okay."

They switched seats.

Olivia's expression grew more and more peculiar as she read.
###Chapter 496

Sophia, That's Not Fair

Her phone screen lit up.

Nine missed calls from Julian Winston.

And one... from Alexander Laurent.

A new WeChat message popped up.

Forty messages from Julian.

Olivia Lopez skimmed them.

[Having dinner with a man behind my back?]

[Thought it was a girls' night?]

[Isn't Zachary Lowell a man?]

[Olivia, you're such a hypocrite!]

...

[Reply to me!]

...

[Answer your phone!]

...

[I'm dealing with you tonight!]

Olivia scrolled to the bottom.

She rolled her eyes.

Replied: [Piss off]

Julian responded instantly: [Finally decided to grace me with a reply?]

[Olivia, you're heartless]

...

A string of messages flooded in.

Olivia couldn't be bothered to read them.

She exited the chat.

Opened Alexander's WeChat.

Only two messages.

[Where are you and Sophia Sullivan?]

[Is Zachary Lowell there too?]

Olivia raised an eyebrow.

Their last message was from a month ago.

She had only replied with a curt 'Yeah'.

He was usually so sparing with words.

Now he was actively asking about her whereabouts.

And it was about Sophia.

Something was off.

A sly glint flashed in Olivia's eyes.

She found the photo she had secretly taken earlier.

Tapped send with her fingertip.

The stopwatch began counting.

Five seconds.

Her phone vibrated.

Alexander: [Address]

Olivia's eyes widened.

She had guessed right.

She pondered for a moment.

Replied: [Bro, don't Sophia and Zachary make a cute couple?]

Silence from the other end for a few seconds.

[No]

Olivia was shocked.

So direct?

She pressed further: [Why not? Sophia's been single for two years. It's time she started dating.]

Alexander: [They're not suited at all.]

Olivia: "..."

[Do you like Sophia?]

A direct hit.

There was no further reply from the other end.

Olivia felt restless all afternoon.

Even her new handbag felt dull and uninteresting.

Sophia looked at her, puzzled.

After dinner that evening.

Olivia dropped her off at the entrance of the alley.

"I'm heading in, Liv."

"...Okay."

Sophia got out of the car.

"Sophia!" Olivia suddenly called out to her.

"Yeah?"

"Be careful..."

"Got it. Bye."

Sophia walked into the alley.

Olivia watched her enter the apartment building.

Then she drove away.

Back at her apartment, she was still distracted.

Did her brother like Sophia?

Since when?

This was Alexander Laurent they were talking about.

A research fanatic.

A stoic professor.

Had he actually developed feelings?

Aunt Sylvia would lose her mind if she found out.

As she was lost in thought.

Warm breath brushed against her neck.

A damp sensation followed.

Olivia jumped.

Swung her hand back instinctively.

Julian didn't dodge in time.

Took the hit on his forehead.

"Damn—trying to kill your man?"

Olivia frowned: "Sneaking up on me? Serves you right!"

"Which other man were you thinking about? Zachary Lowell?"

"Yep. Handsome and good at magic tricks."

"Pfft—just cheap tricks to pick up girls."

"Experience is good. Means he knows how to treat a woman~"

"You—" Julian gritted his teeth, "What's so good about a rookie?"

"I think he's fine... Wait, how did you get in?"

"Ahem!" The man's eyes darted away.

"Julian—"

"Don't argue. Save your energy for later."

"Get lost."

The man grinned roguishly: "Haven't touched you in two days. Don't miss it?"

A flicker of emotion passed through Olivia's eyes.

The next moment, the world spun.

She was thrown onto the bed.

Julian tore off his shirt and pinned her down: "Told you I'd deal with you tonight. A promise is a promise."

Olivia pushed herself up: "You?"

"Try me."

The night deepened.

Spring's allure filled the air.

Some indulged in pleasure.

Others endured torment.

The bedroom was dark.

Moonlight slanted in through the window.

Alexander stood before it.

His silhouette lonely.

His gaze fixed on the distance.

But without focus.

The photo from earlier surfaced in his mind.

Before the floor-to-ceiling window.

Sophia wore a knit maxi dress.

A short cardigan accentuated her slender waist.

She listened attentively as Zachary spoke.

The man looked down at her.

His gaze intense and affectionate.

Sunlight bathed them both.

Like a natural filter.

A painfully perfect match.

The moment he saw the photo.

A vein throbbed at his temple.

His calm eyes churned with stormy waves.

Didn't she say her studies came first?

Didn't she refuse to date?

He knew Sophia.

If she didn't agree.

She wouldn't have accepted the dinner invitation.

If she wasn't at least somewhat interested.

She wouldn't listen so intently.

She certainly wouldn't have accepted that bouquet.

Why?

"Sophia, that's not fair..."

The whisper dissolved into the night.

No one answered.

Alexander clenched his fist.

Took a deep breath.

Tried to suppress the surging jealousy.

And desire.

His emotions were spiraling out of control.

Reason teetered on the edge.

He didn't know how much longer he could hold on.

If he couldn't next time...

What would he do?

Would he end up hurting her?

Resentment and longing intertwined.

Impossible to suppress.

It had been impossible for a long time now.

In the darkness.

The man let out a low laugh.

Self-mocking and helpless.

Alexander Laurent.

Look at you now.
###Chapter 497
The morning sun crept through the gap in the curtains, softly illuminating the woman's sleeping face.

A gentle breeze stirred the sheer curtains, making them sway silently.

The phone rang abruptly.

Sophia answered groggily. "Grandpa?"

Isaac Atlante paused. "Still sleeping? I can call back later..."

"No, it's fine, I'm awake. I'm on break, not at the lab, so I slept in a bit. What's up, Grandpa?"

A soft sigh came through the line.

Isaac's old friend had suffered a sudden heart attack the previous night and passed away despite efforts to save him.

The family had called that morning, asking Isaac to help oversee the funeral arrangements.

"...Old Chen left so suddenly. His wife and children are lost without him. We had decades of friendship; I can't just stand by. But your grandmother has her follow-up appointment at the hospital today. Sebastian is away on business. I thought about it and... you're the only one I can ask to accompany her..."

"Grandpa! It's no trouble at all! I should be the one accompanying Grandma. Don't worry, go help your friend. I'll take care of Grandma."

"Good, good."

At nine a.m., Sophia arrived punctually at the Atlante residence.

The elderly lady was already ready, standing by the door with her small bag.

Her husband stood beside her, speaking in a low voice—

"...Why bother Sophia? She's so busy with her lab work and studies. My little appointment isn't worth troubling her... See, now the child is worried."

The grandmother murmured her gentle reproach.

Grandpa nodded repeatedly. "Yes, yes, you're right. But I heard Sophia was on break, so I asked..."

"Just because she's on break means she should accompany me to the hospital? It's not exactly a fun place. We have the housekeeper and staff. Were you afraid no one would go with me?"

"Grandma—" Sophia pushed the car door open and walked over with a smile. "I wanted to come. Don't scold Grandpa."

Isaac's face immediately brightened into a smile.

His little granddaughter was so thoughtful!

"Alright, I won't scold him..." The grandmother took her granddaughter's hand. "Have you eaten breakfast? There's some ready at home. Martha—"

"No need, I've eaten. Grandma, let's go."

Sophia opened the car door and helped her grandmother inside.

She glanced back at her grandfather with a reassuring look before circling to the driver's seat and starting the car.

...

In the internal medicine department of the city hospital.

The grandmother's eyes had improved significantly after acupuncture treatments, but she still needed medication.

Regular follow-ups to adjust the prescription were essential.

The doctor on duty had been overseeing Florence Atlante's treatment and was familiar with her condition.

"How's your eyesight recently?"

"Much clearer, but I occasionally see dark flashes."

The elderly doctor nodded. "That's normal during treatment. It's fine as long as it's not frequent. Any eye pain?"

"Not usually, unless it's windy or I get cold water in them."

"It's quite good progress for a chronic condition. Keep resting well, maintain stable emotions, don't cry... This time, I'll adjust the dosage of a few herbs. The usage remains the same: one dose for internal use, one for external application."

"Okay—"

The grandmother responded obediently.

She was like a different person compared to before.

Now she had her daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter. She needed to not only heal her eyes but also take good care of her health to be with them for a long time.

Soon, the doctor adjusted the prescription, printed it, and handed it to Sophia.

"Thank you, Director Huang."

The doctor waved his hand. "You're welcome. Such a sweet, polite young lady. Truly delightful."

Florence immediately smiled with pride. "Of course! My granddaughter is perfect in every way."

The doctor's eyes twinkled. "Such a beautiful girl must have many suitors. Does she have a boyfriend yet?"

"Not yet. Ordinary boys aren't good enough for our Sophia."

"Yes, yes, ordinary ones certainly won't do. But my grandson is actually quite excellent..."

The grandmother quickly interjected. "No, no. Our Sophia isn't in a hurry to marry. We want to keep her for a few more years..."

Seeing the conversation getting increasingly off track, Sophia slipped out of the consultation room with the prescription.

Better to go get the medicine first...

Just as she stepped back outside, she accidentally bumped into someone.

"Sorry..." Sophia quickly turned to apologize.

She paused when she saw who it was. "...Zachary Wang?"

"Sophia! What a coincidence! We meet again!" Zachary Wang's smile was radiant.

Seeing him holding a thermal lunchbox, Sophia assumed he was visiting a patient. "This is the outpatient area. The inpatient wards are in the building across the way."

Zachary quickly explained. "I'm not visiting a patient. I'm bringing lunch for my grandfather. He's a doctor here and has consultations all day. My mom was worried he wouldn't eat properly, so she sent me to deliver it."

Sophia glanced at the nameplate on the consultation room door, understanding dawning. "Your grandfather's surname is Huang?"

"Yes, Huang Qi, like the herb. How did you know?"

Uh-oh!

"I accompanied my grandmother today for her follow-up with him..."

"So that's it!"

Zachary noticed the prescription in her hand. "Going to get the medicine?"

"Yes. Need to get it filled first, then queue for the decoction service."

"Do you know where the pharmacy is?" Zachary suddenly asked.

Sophia: "There are signs. It shouldn't be hard to find."

"Wait here a moment. I'll just drop this off inside, then I'll take you to the smaller pharmacy. They don't close at noon, and there's no queue."

"That's too much trouble. Just tell me where it is. I can go myself."

"No trouble at all! Wait here, I'll be quick!"

With that, he pushed the door open and went in.

He was out in less than ten seconds.

He had probably just dropped off the lunchbox and said a quick hello.

"Let's go, I'll take you. It's quiet at noon. You'll get the medicine quickly."

"...Okay. Thank you."

They went down to the first floor.

Zachary walked beside her, glancing at her as if worried she might get lost. "Sophia, this way..."

Just then, another voice came from nearby. "Sophia."

Sophia turned, slightly surprised. "...Professor?"

Zachary looked over and met Alexander Laurent's gaze.

Their eyes locked. One held curiosity mixed with assessment, the other was icy cold, his gaze seeming to emit a chill.

Zachary: "?"

He had seen this man before.

He was also there when Zachary delivered the invitation to the Atlante residence.

He later heard he was from the Laurent family.

But...

Why was he looking at him like that?

Zachary frowned, trying hard to recall if he had ever offended him.

However—

He hadn't.

In fact, before this, he hadn't even heard the name "Alexander Laurent."
###Chapter 498
Growing Greedy

Sophia Sullivan paused mid-step.

She saw Alexander Laurent standing at the end of the hallway.

"Professor?" She was surprised. "What are you doing at the hospital?"

Alexander's gaze shifted back from the distance.

It softened instantly when it landed on her face. "I..."

"He brought me here." Quincy Evans clutched his stomach as he stepped forward, his face pale.

Sophia looked at him. "Professor Evans? Are you feeling unwell?"

"Don't ask... I must have eaten something bad. I've had diarrhea since morning. Medicine didn't help. Alex insisted on dragging me here for a check-up."

Sophia nodded. "You really should get checked out. Stomach issues can be serious. It's better to find out early."

"Huh? Why do you two sound exactly the same?"

Sophia raised an eyebrow, glancing at Alexander.

Alexander was looking at her.

His gaze was deep, carrying some indescribable emotion.

"Sophia, we should go." Sebastian Evans spoke up suddenly.

Sophia snapped out of it. "Okay."

She turned to Alexander. "Professor, we're leaving now."

She walked away side by side with Sebastian.

Alexander remained where he was.

His eyes followed their retreating figures, gradually darkening.

"...Alex? Alex!"

Quincy called his name twice.

Alexander turned to look at him, the chill in his eyes not yet dissipated.

Quincy shivered. "You..."

"She said 'we'."

"Huh?" Quincy was stunned.

It took him a few seconds to process. "What's wrong with 'we'? How else should she say it? It's not incorrect..."

Alexander's face was expressionless.

She and Sebastian were a "we".

Then what was he?

What did he count as?

Alexander suddenly realized she always called him "Professor".

Polite, distant, perfectly appropriate.

But never intimate.

What did she call Sebastian?

Mr. Evans?

Or Sebastian?

His expression grew darker.

This low pressure atmosphere persisted all the way to the examination room.

The doctor finished asking about Quincy's symptoms and prescribed medication.

Then he looked at Alexander—

"And you? What seems to be the problem?"

Alexander: "...I don't have diarrhea."

"? But you look terrible. I'd recommend a full physical exam."

"..."

Quincy stifled a laugh, making his stomach hurt even more.

This feeling...

Was truly unbearable!

...

Sophia followed Sebastian to the small pharmacy.

It was located in a very hidden spot, at a corner on the ground floor of the second inpatient building.

There was no sign.

You only knew it was a VIP-exclusive pharmacy once you entered.

It didn't need a sign.

Those who could come here naturally knew the way.

All the pharmacists knew Sebastian.

"Brought your girlfriend?" someone teased.

"Sis, don't say that... just a friend."

The female doctor glanced at Sophia, lowering her voice. "Friends can develop into girlfriends, you know."

Sebastian scratched his head and grinned foolishly. "I wish..."

But Sophia always kept him at arm's length.

It left his heart suspended mid-air. It was agonizing, yet he cherished the feeling.

Sophia didn't hear any of this.

Her mind was entirely on her grandmother's medicine.

The VIP pharmacy was highly efficient.

The medicine was quickly decocted and sealed in separate bags.

You just needed to warm them in hot water when it was time to drink.

An hour later, the two of them left.

Sophia received a call from her grandmother—

"Hello, Grandma?... I got the medicine, it was decocted at the small pharmacy... Okay, wait for me, I'll come pick you up right away."

She put away her phone and looked at Sebastian. "Thanks for today. I need to go get my grandmother. I'm heading off."

"...Okay! See you!"

Sebastian watched her walk away.

He didn't withdraw his gaze until her figure disappeared completely.

His phone rang—

Sebastian: "Hello?"

"You brat! You just drop off the lunchbox and run off? Who's more important than your grandfather?"

"...Heh heh."

Professor Huang: "?"

Was this kid possessed?

When Sophia drove out of the hospital, Alexander had just picked up the medicine.

He sat on a bench in the outpatient area, waiting for Quincy who was still in the restroom.

Ten minutes later, Quincy emerged unsteadily.

"Alex... give me a hand..."

Alexander stood up and supported him, unable to hide a frown. "You're this weak?"

"You try going over a dozen times!"

"..."

"But you were already weak. The doctor just said you looked terrible."

Alexander made a move to let go.

"No, no, no... I was joking... you can't take a joke."

Alexander helped him sit down.

He handed him the medicine. "Take this first. To prevent dehydration."

Quincy: "..."

After taking the medicine, he felt a bit better.

Maybe it was psychological.

As long as the diarrhea stopped!

Quincy adjusted his sitting position and spoke slowly—

"Alex, just now, when you saw Sophia with that kid, your eyes turned red. Talk to me. What's really going on between you and Sophia?"

Alexander was silent.

Just as Quincy thought he wouldn't get an answer, he spoke.

"I asked her if she would start a new relationship."

"What did she say?" Quincy asked seriously.

"She said her studies are her priority right now. She isn't considering anything else."

"So you don't accept that answer now?"

Alexander looked up, his eyes deep and unfathomable. "...I don't know. But seeing her get close to Sebastian Evans, I feel..."

He paused, searching for the right word.

A few seconds later, he continued. "Unbalanced."

Yes, unbalanced.

Quincy: "You don't want to see her get close to other men, but you're just friends. You have no right to interfere, right?"

"...Yes."

So he had changed.

He had grown greedy.

No longer satisfied with just being friends.
###Chapter 499

Quincy Evans shook his head.
"If you want things to change, why not just talk to her directly?"

Alexander Laurent remained silent.

"You're scared.
You're afraid that if you lay it all out, she'll reject you.
That you won't even be able to be friends anymore."

"..."

Quincy frowned.
"This isn't like you.
The Alexander Laurent I know is decisive and resolute.
He doesn't hesitate just because he might fail."

"She said she wasn't considering it for now—the key word is 'for now'!
People's feelings change.
A rejection back then doesn't mean she'll push you away now, understand?"

Alexander was stunned.

Quincy clapped him on the shoulder.
"If you keep hesitating, your girl will really be gone.
You won't even have a place to cry about it."

"Sophia has plenty of suitors.
Forget those two students who fought over her before.
The one today was even more handsome!
Young, full of energy, and from his clothes, his family is well-off too..."

Alexander cut him off.
"Stop."

"Hmph!"

Finally getting anxious, are we?
Let's see if you keep dragging your feet now.

...

Sophia Sullivan drove Mrs. Laurent back to the family estate.
She handed the medicine to the housekeeper.
She carefully explained the dosage and instructions before driving away.

The elderly woman had wanted her to stay for dinner.
But Sophia had already made plans with Marcus Lawrence and Hannah Morse.

"Grandmother, I'll come see you again in a couple of days.
I have plans with classmates tonight."

"Alright, go on then."

She drove to the restaurant.
Marcus and Hannah were already there.

They were discussing a cup of bubble tea.
Hannah was talking animatedly.
Marcus listened intently, nodding occasionally.

"...This bubble tea tastes completely different.
It's nowhere near as good as the one by the school gate!"

Marcus replied, "Mhm."

"What are you 'mhm'-ing about?
You haven't even tried it!"
He took the cup and took a sip.
"...Want the truth?"

Hannah looked at him expectantly.

"I can't tell the difference."

Hannah sighed.
"Fine.
Can't expect much from a man."

"Have you been waiting long?"
Sophia pushed the door open and walked in.

"Sophia!"
Hannah immediately brightened up.

Marcus stood to let her sit, naturally moving to Hannah's side.
No one found this strange.

"Sophia, you said you had something important to discuss?"

Sophia signaled the server to bring the food.
She took a business card from her bag and handed it to them.

Hannah took it and read it.
"...Materials R&D?
Chief Specialist?"

"Yes."

Sophia briefly explained how she got the card.
She omitted the part about running into Zachary Rosedale.
"...Their company is developing a new type of thermal-sensitive material.
They claim its temperature sensitivity accuracy can reach one hundred percent.
The No. 7 measuring device we have now isn't precise enough.
Its data can't go beyond the decimal point.
What if we switched to this new material?"

"Of course, this is just a preliminary idea.
We'd need to verify if this new material actually meets expectations.
I wanted to discuss today whether it's feasible and worth trying."

Sophia finished and looked at them.

Marcus and Hannah were both researchers and her partners.
Lab decisions required unanimous agreement from all three.

She had expected a discussion.
But their reaction was—

"Sophia, why are you even asking us?
If you think it's worth doing, then do it.
Just tell us what you need.
We'll support you fully!"

Marcus nodded.
"Whatever you decide, we're with you."

Sophia was taken aback, then smiled.
"You trust me that much?
Aren't you afraid I might mess up?"

Hannah looked surprised.
"Sophia, if you're messing up, it's only because Hannah and Marcus made a huge mistake first."

"Pfft— It wouldn't come to that."

But such trust was heartwarming.

After the meal, Marcus went to settle the bill.

Sophia and Hannah walked to the parking lot together.

Hannah said, "Sophia, you go ahead.
I'll wait for Marcus."

"Oh?"

"We're heading the same way.
He doesn't have a car.
I'll just give him a ride back.
Hehe."

"Alright, drive safely."

"Will do~"

After reaching an agreement with her partners, Sophia went home and started preparing.

She researched, drafted a material optimization plan, and checked it over repeatedly.

At ten p.m., Sophia proactively texted Zachary Rosedale.

[Are you free, Mr. Rosedale? There's something I'd like to discuss.]

At that moment, Zachary was at home being interrogated by his mother.

"Your grandfather said you went to deliver a meal today.
You just dropped off the container and left.
Someone also saw you accompanying a girl at the hospital pharmacy...
Spill it.
Are you seeing someone?"

Zachary complained, "Grandpa actually tattled on me?!"

"You rascal!
Your grandfather cares about your future."

"No, no.
Ask me a hundred times, the answer is still no."

"You—"

A WeChat notification tone suddenly rang out.

Hearing the special tone, Zachary immediately stood up.
He looked at his phone as he headed upstairs.

His mother thought: Still saying no?!
This is what you call no?!

Two minutes after Sophia sent her message, she received a reply from Zachary.

[Sophia, what is it?]
[Calling me 'Mr. Rosedale' is too formal.
You can call me Zachary or Zac.]

Sophia: [Is a phone call convenient?]

Zachary's hand trembled.
Happiness came too suddenly—

[Yes, it is.
My number is 132...]

Sophia called immediately and got straight to the point.

Though elated, Zachary was completely serious about business.
"...I remember this material.
But I need to confirm which R&D department is handling it specifically."
"I'll look into it and get back to you tomorrow, alright?"

Sophia: "Okay.
Thank you."

That night, Sophia, having solved a difficult problem, slept soundly.

Zachary, having obtained his crush's phone number, was too excited to sleep.
He tossed and turned until 2 a.m. before finally falling asleep with a smile.

His dreams were sweet.

The next morning, Sophia didn't receive a reply from Zachary.
Instead, she got a call from Alexander Laurent...
###Chapter 500

A year ago, Sophia Sullivan had briefly used Alexander Laurent's physics lab.

She met Professor Quincy Evans and Dr. Zoe Langley there.

Over several months, they went from strangers to acquaintances.

Quincy once noticed Sophia processed experimental data at an astonishing speed.

He learned she had taught herself programming and wrote a small app for data organization.

It could even perform multi-dimensional classification and sorting.

Quincy was deeply impressed.

He asked Sophia to write one for the lab too.

This app greatly improved their data processing efficiency.

Quincy often sighed while using it. "Thank goodness for Sophia."

Yesterday, the program crashed.

Dr. Simon Lowell tried to fix it.

The entire system ended up paralyzed.

No one dared touch it now. They had to ask Sophia for help.

Alexander sounded hesitant. "Are you free today? If not, another day is fine…"

Quincy's original words were: "If I don't get Sophia here today, I'll—I'll publicly have diarrhea!"

He went to the hospital for medicine yesterday. It temporarily helped, but the pain returned at night.

He had been running to the restroom all morning at the lab.

Six times just before noon.

That threat was effective.

Sophia said, "I'm free. I'll come now."

"…Okay. I'll meet you at the main gate."

She wanted to refuse, but he had already hung up.

Ten minutes later, Sophia saw Alexander at the gate.

They walked while discussing the crash details.

Alexander explained, "The sorting function failed yesterday afternoon. After attempting repairs, even data export became impossible."

Sophia pondered. "I'll need to examine it to determine the exact cause."

"Sophia! You're finally here—" Quincy rushed over excitedly as they entered the lab.

"Are you feeling better, Professor Evans?" She smiled and nodded.

"The medicine helps, but full recovery will take a couple more days."

"Were your test results clear?"

"The doctor said everything's fine."

"That's good."

Quincy pulled her to the computer. "Alex explained the situation? Without the program, data organization takes an hour. The efficiency is terrible."

"Thank goodness you're here. This was becoming unbearable."

"Ahem!" Alexander cleared his throat softly.

Quincy looked slightly embarrassed. He quickly adjusted a chair. "Please, sit—"

"Thank you, Professor Evans."

Sophia sat down. Her fingers flew across the keyboard.

She identified the problem within half an hour.

Next came debugging.

It wasn't difficult for her, but it required time.

Alexander ordered lunch.

"Eat first. You can continue after." He placed the meal box beside her.

She turned and smiled. "Thank you, Professor."

"Of course." He paused. "Actually, you don't need to be so formal with me."

She didn't catch the disappointment in his tone. She joked, "Better to be polite. I wouldn't want to be accused of disrespect."

Alexander's voice grew quiet. "I'm not your teacher."

She looked down, opening the meal box. "It's close enough."

Alexander fell silent.

The lid opened, releasing the aroma of food.

All her favorite dishes—

Sweet and sour pork ribs, steamed egg with shrimp, shredded pork with green peppers.

She thanked him earnestly again.

Alexander seemed to want to say more but stopped.

After lunch, Sophia continued debugging.

She worked until five in the afternoon.

Aside from restroom breaks and brief conversations, she remained focused on the screen.

"…Is Dr. Lowell not in today?" Sophia asked.

Quincy sighed. "That guy still isn't over his breakup. He's been taking lots of time off these past two weeks. Didn't come in again today."

"Breakup?" Sophia was surprised.

"You didn't know?!"

She shook her head.

Quincy leaned closer, sharing the gossip in a low voice.

Hearing "Alex fired Lillian Lopez not long after returning from Shanghai," fragments of memory flashed in Sophia's mind. Her expression turned subtle.

"…Perhaps he loved too deeply. The separation is painful. Give him time to adjust. He'll come around eventually."

Sophia hummed softly and asked no more.

Other people's affairs were not her concern.

As the evening sun set, Sophia finally completed the repairs.

Quincy immediately tested the program's functions—

Half a minute later. "It's fixed! Really fixed! It works again!"

Zoe jumped for joy. "Wonderful! No more manual data entry. Today was torture!"

Quincy checked his watch. "It's so late. You've worked hard all day, Sophia! Alex—"

"…Hmm?" Alexander seemed distracted.

Quincy said, "Sophia helped so much. Shouldn't you show some appreciation? At least treat her to a meal?"

"Absolutely. It's the least I can do."

"Good! I'll book a restaurant right away."

Alexander nodded.

Inviting Sophia meant including Quincy and Zoe too.

The four arrived at the restaurant to find the dishes already served.

They sat down and began eating.

Midway, Sophia went to the restroom. Returning, she took a call from Julian Winston in the hallway.

"…Sorry for the wait. I checked with R&D. They are developing the thermosensitive material you mentioned."

Sophia's eyes lit up.

"But it's unclear if it meets your requirements. I suggest an on-site inspection to test parameters. Of course, only if you have time…"

"I have time!"

Julian paused for two seconds. "The location is in Z City. It will take several days. Are you sure you want to go yourself? I can handle it."

She had to go.

"Okay," Sophia nodded. "When do we leave?"

He said something on the other end.

She smiled. "I look forward to this trip to Z City too… It's settled then. Ten tomorrow morning at the airport… Yes. We'll talk more then."

She hung up and walked back briskly.

Unaware Alexander, who had gone to pay the bill early, overheard every word.

She was going to Z City with Julian?

Had their relationship progressed to traveling together?

Alexander's eyes darkened instantly.

After the meal, they left the restaurant. Sophia got into Alexander's car.

Silence filled the ride.

Sophia was planning her Z City itinerary and didn't speak either.

What was the weather like there?

How many clothes should she pack?

…

By the time they reached her apartment building, she had everything figured out.

They walked side by side toward the entrance.

Alexander suddenly stopped and called her. "Sophia Sullivan—"

The woman turned, startled. "Professor? What is it?"

He had never used her full name like this before.

The man stood in the shadows, his expression unreadable. "Why Julian Winston?"

"…What?"

"I thought Sebastian Evans was my rival. But he became your cousin. I was relieved he was out of the picture. I thought I would be the one by your side."

"If you ever wanted to date, I should have been the first one you saw."

"But it's not Sebastian. And it's not me. It's Julian. I don't understand. Can you tell me why?"

Sophia was completely stunned.

"Pro—Professor, what are you talking about?"

Alexander slowly lifted his head. The streetlight illuminated his profile. The deep affection in his eyes was unmistakable.

"You still don't understand? Then let me be perfectly clear—"

He gazed into her eyes, enunciating each word. "Sophia Sullivan, I am in love with you."

"Madly in love with you."
