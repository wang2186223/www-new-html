###Chapter 1

"Oh my god... this is too much..."

The girl kneeling on the dorm bed let out a sound close to a sob. Her delicate body arched forward, hands clutching the sheets as she froze in place.

I held her tightly until she collapsed onto the mattress like melted jelly...

I'm a freshman.

Yesterday, after military training ended, my girlfriend who'd been pent up for weeks couldn't wait to drag me into the girls' dorm.

With help from her and her roommate, I dodged the dorm matron's inspection and stayed overnight.

"Big Stallion, I want you..."

Right after lights out, she grabbed my hand and shoved it under her nightgown, kissing me aggressively.

I squeezed her petite bottom. "They're still awake."

"Don't think I don't know..." She writhed against me like a water snake, wrapping a slender leg around my waist. "You always make me scream on purpose... so they can hear you... fucking me..."

She whispered the last two words against my ear.

"You little slut! That desperate for it?"

Feeling her slick tongue, my own excitement grew. I yanked off her nightgown, pinned her hands above her head with one arm, and pressed her down.

"Yes... I'm your slut... don't you love me like this?" She rocked her hips, teasing me further. "Am I being slutty enough tonight? Hmm?"

"Slutty? You're the sluttiest!"

Finally losing control, I flipped her onto her stomach, gripped her slender waist, and mounted her.

That's when I noticed Sophia across the room stirring.

Was she watching?

I glanced sideways and saw clearly: Sophia's chest heaved with rapid breaths, lips parted, cheeks flushed. Her glazed eyes tracked my movements while her hand slipped into her pajama bottoms, fingers moving subtly.

Our eyes met. Shock first, then intense thrill.

Sophia seemed so innocent, yet turned out to be a Ms. Jekyll and Hyde.

Watching us while touching herself.

I didn't care if my girlfriend noticed Sophia spying. I spread her legs wider and drove into her like a wild stallion, repeating brutal thrusts.

"Ah... I can't... have mercy..."

Until her cries turned tearful and she melted into the bed.

Early next morning, the dorm matron dragged me out of bed.

By the time I got out of the Dean's office after the lecture, lunch break was over.

Having held my urine all day, my bladder felt ready to burst.

I rushed toward the Administration Building restroom.

But at the men's room entrance, a sign stood on the floor: "Under Maintenance. Sorry for inconvenience."

I checked the empty hallway. No choice—had to use the women's restroom.

I never expected to find a petite girl just finishing urination in the far stall, pants around her knees, head bowed while pulling up her panties.

It was Sophia.

She froze in shock like me, forgetting to pull up her underwear for a solid ten seconds.

"Click-clack."

Hurried footsteps echoed outside.

###Chapter 2

Without thinking, I squeezed into the narrow stall, pressing flush against Sophia's bare skin.
The stall door next to us creaked open.
The rustle of clothing followed.
Then the distinct sound of urine hitting the porcelain basin echoed through the space.

Though not loud, the noise was unnervingly clear in the empty restroom.

Sophia squirmed in my arms, her cheeks flushed with embarrassment.

I looked down at the delicate girl nestled against me.
Her hair carried a subtle fragrance.
Memories of last night’s recklessness in the girls' dorm flashed through my mind.
My hand slid down the curve of her back, coming to rest firmly on her surprisingly resilient bottom.

Her rear wasn’t particularly full, likely from years of dance training.
But the feel was exquisite.
Especially when she swayed her hips slightly, her legs trembling.
The flesh beneath my palm seemed to come alive, moving with a rhythm of its own.

Soft whimpers escaped her lips.
Her legs twisted together restlessly.
Her breathing grew ragged.
Her entire body trembled, going limp against me.

If not for my arms holding her up, she would have collapsed to the floor.

I’d never known a girl could be this sensitive.

Seizing the opportunity, I tugged firmly at her waistband.
In one motion, I pulled both her pants and panties down to her ankles.
I bent her over, pressing her against the cold stall wall.

"No… we can't…" she pleaded in a hushed, breathy voice.
She twisted, trying to shield herself with her hands.
"I'm… I'm a virgin. Not here… not in a restroom."

"Then use your mouth."

Her hands flew up to cover her lips instantly.

Thump. Thump.

A sudden knocking came from the adjacent stall.
A girl's voice followed. "Sophia? Are you okay?"

It was Chloe. Another one of Isabella's dormmates.

"N-no… I'm fine."

"You sound strange. Are you sick?"

"Umm… I just… saw a cockroach…"

The sound of a toilet flushing filled the air.
Chloe stepped out to wash her hands. "Hurry up, then. I'll wait for you outside."

Once Chloe's footsteps faded, Sophia pushed away from me.
Her voice shook. "I'll… I'll let you… but not here. Not like this."

She pulled her clothing back into place.
With hesitant, backward glances, she slipped out of the stall.

I took a moment to steady my own breathing.
When silence returned to the restroom, I quietly made my exit.
###Chapter 3

I waited alone outside the girls' dormitory that evening.

My only goal was to release some pent-up frustration.

Before my girlfriend showed up, her three roommates appeared instead.

"Hey, couldn't get enough last night? Planning to sleep in our dorm again tonight?"

"I heard you're packing 22 centimeters. Even bigger than those black guys. Is that true?"

Chloe Winston said this with a teasing smirk.

She stood around five-foot-seven, always wearing crop tops and skin-tight jeans.

Her low-rise waistband practically revealed everything. She had that fuckdoll body that could drive any man wild.

I remembered hearing her forceful stream in the women's restroom at noon. The memory stirred something in me.

"Of course it's true. Better watch out or I might climb into the wrong bed and have my way with you."

Chloe and another girl burst into giggles.

Only Sophia Lowell blushed deeply, lost in her own thoughts.

I glanced at Sophia. If my girlfriend didn't show, taking her to a hotel might be a good alternative.

Chloe waved her hand in front of my face. "You two have something going on? Making eyes at each other already?"

Her words made Sophia's face turn from tomato-red to eggplant-purple.

This looked promising.

But Chloe added, "Listen, don't do anything behind your girlfriend's back while she's sick."

"She's sick?" I asked, surprised.

"You didn't know?" Chloe countered.

"I had no idea. I'll climb through your window after lights-out to check on her."

Worried, I forgot about Sophia for the moment.

Unlike yesterday, my usual routine involved sneaking into the girls' dorm first.

I would hide in my girlfriend's bed until after room checks, then we'd have our fun.

But after getting caught this morning, security would be tighter.

Sneaking past room checks would be nearly impossible.

The only way to spend the night now was climbing through the window.

After room checks ended, I scaled the dorm's security grating.

"Hurry up and open the window!"

My girlfriend helped me inside while scolding, "Are you crazy? This is the third floor!"

"For you, I'd climb thirty floors!"

The room filled with mock groans. Chloe and another girl complained about the cheesiness.

"How are you feeling?"

She looked touched, nearly tearing up. "Just a common cold."

Footsteps echoed outside the door.

A girl on the second floor had been awake and thought there was a burglar. She alerted the dorm matron.

Panic spread through the room.

I moved to hide in my girlfriend's bed, but she pulled me back.

"You've got a record now. Hiding in my bed will get you caught. Hide in the opposite bed instead."

I climbed into Sophia's bed.

The dorm matron stopped by my girlfriend's bed, peering inside by moonlight.

I lay in Sophia's bed, holding my breath.

But right beside me was a girl wearing only her underwear.

We were practically embracing each other. How could I resist?

I slowly placed my hand on Sophia's buttock, gently kneading it.

Her body trembled, but she made no sound.

Emboldened, I used my other hand to slide aside the fabric of her panties.
###Chapter 4
"Really no one came to your dorm?" the dorm matron asked.

"No!"

"Why is the window open?"

"It was too stuffy. Just getting some fresh air."

The situation downstairs was critical, but my focus was entirely on the girl in my arms. I gently lifted her right leg and pressed closer against her side.

"Mmm..."

Sophia couldn't help but let out a soft moan. The dorm matron immediately glanced over suspiciously. "What's wrong?"

"Ouch!"

Thankfully, my girlfriend reacted quickly. Seeing the danger, she immediately crouched down and groaned in pain. "Ouch, my stomach hurts so bad... Wuwu..."

The girls from the other two beds jumped down. "She's sick! Let's get her to the campus clinic."

"Why didn't you say so earlier? Hurry up!" Urged by the dorm matron, they quickly rushed out of the dorm.

The room returned to darkness and silence.

I gripped her slender waist and lifted her forcefully. Her petite bottom rose high as I tugged down her panties.

"Mmm... I knew it... You and Sophia have something going on... Ah..."

The girl in my arms trailed her fingers down my abdomen while turning her head to reveal a blushing face. Her eyes held both reproach and shyness.

Her voice became irresistibly sweet. "You... You really are 22 centimeters..."

I froze in shock.

"Chloe? Why is it you?"

"What? Dis...disappointed? Or...scared? Weren't you going to rape me... Ah..."

Her seductive allure was too much for any man to resist. I pushed her bra up to her neck, lifted her legs over my shoulders, and pressed down on her.

"Even if I got the wrong person, I’m not stopping. Tonight, if I don’t make you scream 'Daddy,' I lose..."

Just then, a voice shattered my burning passion.

My bed was near the door, so even the slightest noise from the hallway was audible.

"Ma’am, she really has a stomachache. We weren’t lying..."

"The situation is too tense lately. No one is allowed in or out freely. Besides, it’s so late—the campus clinic is closed. Go back and take some medicine..."

That was Sophia’s voice. I’d recognize it anywhere.

They were sent back?

Clearly, Chloe realized it too. She whispered, "They’re back!"

As the voices drew nearer, alarm bells rang in my head.

I was still in Chloe’s bed. I couldn’t let Isabella see me here!

I had to get out.

With no other choice, I swiftly rolled off the bed.

Just as they were about to push the door open, I slipped out through the window.

Security had indeed been tightened lately. Glancing back as I left the girls’ dorm, I spotted patrols in the hallway, their faint lights flickering.

I broke out in a cold sweat. It seemed I wouldn’t be able to come here easily for the next few nights.

I tiptoed back to the boys’ dorm. Thankfully, my roommates knew my habits and had left the door unlocked for me. Otherwise, I’d have been stranded tonight.

My heart pounded wildly. That was too close.

Lying in my own bed, I couldn’t calm down for a long time.

Every time I closed my eyes, I saw Chloe—her perky bottom and fiery figure. The sensation of her skin lingered in my mind, stirring desire low in my stomach.

A cold wind whistled through the window, snapping me back to my senses.

I pinched my arm hard.

I have a girlfriend. How could I be so easily tempted?

Isabella would be hurt if she knew.

Last night… I’ll blame it on the alcohol. I wasn’t thinking straight.

Chloe… She wouldn’t tell Isabella, right?

After much deliberation, I still felt guilty toward Isabella. I decided to buy her favorite pastries from that artisan bakery tomorrow morning. A small apology.

I barely slept all night and woke up early. I took a cab to the artisan bakery ten miles away, planning to surprise Isabella.

Just then, a phone call shattered all my plans.
###Chapter 5

My heart jumped violently, sensing trouble.

"What is it, Chloe?"

I pretended nonchalance, as if making casual conversation.

"Tyler, let's meet."

My brow furrowed in confusion, though I could guess the reason.

I played dumb, feigning innocence. "Whatever it is, we can discuss it over the phone."

Chloe laughed coldly. "Do you really think this is something to discuss over the phone?"

I swallowed hard, glancing down at the pastry in my hand, instinctively searching for an excuse.

"Another day, okay? Today isn't good."

Her tone was adamant, insisting on meeting now.

"Right now. Or I'll go to Isabella."

She was threatening me with Isabella!

Anger flared, but I forced it down, knowing she had leverage over me.

Nothing happened last night anyway.

Fine. Keep calm and carry on.

"Where?"

She gave me an address to a deserted park on the outskirts of town.

She told me to follow a narrow path into the woods, where she would be waiting.

What was she up to, being so secretive?

I grumbled inwardly.

Entering the dense forest, a faint, pleasant fragrance filled the air, soothing and invigorating.

After circling several times without seeing anyone, a voice suddenly came from behind.

"You're here."

I jumped, turning to see a figure that had appeared out of nowhere. It was Chloe.

"What do you want to say that required bringing me here?"

Chloe wore a distant, icy smile.

"About last night. How are you going to explain it to Isabella?"

For some reason, I felt restless and agitated.

"I acted on impulse. Let's pretend it never happened. I'll make it up to you..."

Chloe scoffed. "Make it up to me how?"

As I racked my brain for a solution, I missed her cunning expression.

Her eyes shifted to the cake in my hand, and she swiftly snatched it away.

"How about this in exchange?"

Before I could react, it was gone.

"Not that..."

The restlessness grew stronger. My body felt weak and uncomfortable, my words fading on my lips.

Finally, I realized something was wrong.

What was happening to me?

Why did my body feel like it was on fire?

I blinked, trying to clear my mind, but the desire only burned brighter like wildfire.

I leaned against a tree, using its cool surface to soothe the strange heat within.

Chloe smiled triumphantly, stepping closer.

"Tyler, what's wrong? Are you hot?"

Then, while I was struggling, she wrapped her arms around my waist and buried her face against me.

Every hair on my body stood on end. I tried to push her away but had no strength left. My breathing grew ragged.

"Chloe, what are you doing..."

My hands trembled uncontrollably. Sweat dripped from my forehead.

She pressed further, unzipping my jacket and pulling it off.
###Chapter 6
I warned in a low growl, "Chloe, don't you dare..."

She only grew more unrestrained, screaming as if deliberately seeking attention.

A sudden realization struck me like a thunderbolt.

This is a trap!

"Tyler, what are you doing?"

A familiar voice echoed behind me, freezing the blood in my veins.

Before I could process it, another voice chimed in. "See? Isabella was right."

Chloe immediately clung to herself, scrambling away from me as if I were poison.

She trembled violently, her demeanor shifting instantly.

Isabella stood there, stunned, with Sophia by her side.

Her eyes burned with disbelief and rage, tears streaming down her face.

My heart plummeted. I wanted to explain, but my mind went blank.

"Darling—"

Before I could finish, she covered her ears, cutting me off.

"Don't call me that!"

Chloe's scheme had left me trapped with no way to clear my name.

"Believe me, I didn't do anything to her—"

Chloe interrupted sharply, playing the victim.

"Isabella, you saw it yourself! He tried to assault me last night and lured me here today!"

I opened my mouth to defend myself, but Sophia jumped in, fueling the fire.

"You scumbag! You have Isabella, yet you still chase after Chloe? Disgusting!"

Isabella stood there, shattered, tears flooding down her cheeks.

"Tyler, I didn't want to believe you could do this... until I saw it with my own eyes."

Her gaze fixed on something, and her tears fell even harder.

"That's my favorite cake. You gave it to her too?"

She crumpled to the ground, her face drenched in tears.

My heart ached at the sight. I wanted to hold her and tell her the truth.

But my feet felt rooted to the spot, unable to move.

"Isabella, the cake was for you. I don't know what happened—I felt weak, and then—"

Chloe shouted over me, relentless. "The evidence is right here! I'm taking you to court!"

I clenched my fists, then released them, scoffing in bitter amusement.

She looked every bit the victim, and I knew no amount of explaining would help.

My only hope was Isabella's mercy.

I struggled to kneel before her, gently stroking her hair as I always did.

"Isabella, we've been together for three years. Don't you know who I am?"

Sophia sneered from the sidelines, eager to tear me apart.

"Isabella was blind before, but now she sees you for the beast you are!"

I didn't bother defending myself.

I knew it was useless. Only Isabella could decide what to believe.

After a long moment, she wiped her tears and looked up, not at me, but at Chloe.

"Chloe, please let this go. Don't take it to court."

Chloe crossed her arms, raising an eyebrow in surprise.

"What? You want me to spare this scumbag? Aren't you angry?"

Isabella lowered her gaze, hiding her emotions.

"We've been together for so long. Let's end this with some dignity."

Her words left me with a mix of emotions.

Chloe's eyes gleamed as she proposed an absurd condition.

"Then you have to give up your spot in the National Ballet Championship."

Her demand sounded rehearsed, stunning everyone present.

Isabella sighed softly. "Even if I withdraw, the spot may not go to you."

Chloe lifted her chin confidently.

"Just leave that to me."

I knew how much that competition meant to Isabella. It was her dream, and she had worked tirelessly for it.

I couldn't let her sacrifice it for me.

"Isabella, don't give up your dream."

Her hands clenched into fists, nails digging into her palms.

"I agree."

She turned to me, forcing a look of resolve.

"But there's no future for us anymore."

With those words, she walked away without looking back.

Watching her leave, my heart churned with regret and guilt.

I knew she still cared, yet she had compromised for my sake.

I felt an indescribable mix of gratitude and shame.

If I hadn't fallen into this trap, she wouldn't have lost her chance.

I gritted my teeth, fists tightening.

I won't let this slide. I'll find out what Chloe is really up to.
###Chapter 7
Don't let me catch you, or I'll make you pay a thousand times over.

I skipped classes for several days.
I devoted myself to tracking her every move around the clock.
I became familiar with her entire schedule.

Though she shared a dorm with Isabella, their personalities were worlds apart.
Chloe was calculating and opportunistic.
Everything she did had an ulterior motive.
She loved socializing and had an extensive circle of friends.
In just two days, I spotted five different men around her.

They didn't seem like boyfriends.
But they weren't just friends either.
After days of surveillance, one thing became clear.
Her promiscuity was real.
Though this was an open secret everyone knew.

After three days of partying at bars, she finally returned to campus.
Tracking her had been pure torture.
I'd spent three full days in those bars too.
I hadn't slept properly once.
Yawning constantly, I followed her to the administration building.
She walked straight into the dean's office.

My expression darkened.
She was going to ask about the ballet championship qualification.
If not for me, Isabella would have been on that stage.
The thought made my blood boil.
A dark idea began forming in my mind.

Since Isabella couldn't go, Chloe shouldn't steal her spot either.
She set me up first.
Fighting back was only fair.
"Just give up. I have my ways."
Her confident words echoed in my ears.
Now they carried a deeper meaning.

I needed to see what "ways" she meant.
After the door closed, I crept closer.
The office door had frosted glass at the top.
It offered a blurred view inside.
I had to stand on my toes to see properly.

I checked the time.
It was exactly the end of work hours.
The hallway was empty.
End of work hours?
Why would she come now if she needed a favor?

My suspicion grew stronger.
I felt closer to the truth.
I pressed my ear against the door.
Their conversation became audible.

Chloe spoke first, casual and familiar.
"Still working?"
"Not anymore, now that you're here."
"Did anyone see you come?"
"Don't worry."
"You're terrible."

Those few words conveyed an explosive message.
I couldn't believe my ears.
They were in that kind of relationship?
I stood frozen, completely paralyzed.
It felt like an invisible lightning strike.
All ability to move had left me.
###Chapter 8

All those suspicious points suddenly connected like countless threads weaving together.

I understood.

Her so-called method was using this dean to pull strings for her!

How utterly unscrupulous. I must expose her!

My fingers trembled with excitement as I pulled out my phone. I angled the camera slightly and propped it against the doorframe. Making sure it could capture the scene inside perfectly, I pressed record.

The conversation inside continued.

"You want the candidate spot for the championship? Didn't the college already select someone? I remember a girl named Isabella..."

Hearing Isabella's name, my heart clenched and leaped into my throat.

"She gave it up. Didn't you know?"

"Gave it up? What a shame. I met her once before. That figure, that face... truly exceptional."

The man's occasional greasy laughter made me nauseous.

He should take a good look at himself in the mirror. How dare he have designs on Isabella!

My chest heaved violently. My breath came in short gasps. Rage surged through my entire body.

"Find an opportunity for me to taste her too..."

Chloe chuckled slyly. "After I make your wish come true, will you get me that spot?"

The man promised. "Absolutely."

My chest rose and fell rapidly. Indescribable hatred and fury spread through me.

I will make this despicable pair's affairs public!

And return the competition spot that rightfully belongs to Isabella.

After securing the complete evidence chain, I immediately uploaded the highly revealing video anonymously to the school forum.

The video exploded like a bomb dropped on a calm lake. It sent waves rippling outward.

The forum post ignited instantly. Anger, curiosity, and shock spread rapidly among students and faculty.

"It's because of people like this operating behind the scenes that unfairness persists!"

"We can't let them get away with this. They must be severely punished!"

"That woman is no good either. So young yet willing to mess around with an old man. How shameless!"

I watched the constantly refreshing comments on the screen. Wave after wave of satisfaction and vindication washed over me.

The department dean, a wolf in sheep's clothing who usually pretended to be gentle and refined, became everyone's target.

His image crumbled instantly in people's minds. Those who once sang his praises now condemned his moral corruption.

Chloe's identity was doxxed by netizens. She became a public enemy.

Online comments pushed the incident to its peak. The school administration quickly launched an investigation. After gathering evidence and discussions, they decided to fire the dean.

Similarly, Chloe was expelled from school.

After all the twists and turns, the championship candidate spot finally landed on Isabella's head.
