###Chapter 1

The moment the needle pierced his skin, Ethan Sinclair's eyes flew open.

The sterile scent of disinfectant filled his nostrils. He was back in the familiar hospital blood donation room. Glancing down, he saw the thick needle drawing blood from his arm.

"You've already given 600cc, sir. Are you sure you want to continue?" The nurse's voice was laced with concern.

Ethan froze.

He distinctly remembered dying—drained of his last drop of blood during the nine hundred and ninety-ninth transfusion for Lucas Whitmore.

"Voluntary."

A cold female voice spoke behind him. Ethan shuddered.

He turned slowly and saw the face etched into his soul. Victoria Montgomery stood at the doorway in a black trench coat, her exquisite features as icy as ever.

Memories flooded back.

In his past life, he had loved this woman for ten years. From the moment he first saw her at their high school opening ceremony, to watching her fall for Lucas in college, to later forcing her into marriage with his blood donations as leverage.

He had believed time would change everything.

But seven years of marriage had only earned him the death certificate she signed with her own hand.

"Lucas can't wait. Hurry up." Victoria's impatient voice snapped him back to the present.

Ethan stared at the dark red liquid filling the blood bag and suddenly smiled.

This time, he wouldn't make the same mistakes.

Once the transfusion ended, Victoria grabbed the blood bag and turned to leave. Ethan spoke abruptly. "About the marriage..."

"I keep my promises." She didn't even glance back. "Bring your documents to the Civil Affairs Bureau yourself. I don't have time to accompany you."

Her retreating figure was as cold and resolute as he remembered.

Ethan reached into his pocket and found Lucas's ID and household register—likely taken by mistake in Victoria's haste.

A wild idea flashed through his mind.

Two hours later, Ethan stood outside the Civil Affairs Bureau, holding two crimson marriage certificates.

Printed clearly on them were the names: Victoria Montgomery and Lucas Whitmore.

"This... should make everything right."

He slipped the certificates into an envelope and mailed it to the hospital.

In this life, he chose to let go.

He chose to leave the Ethan Sinclair who had once been obsessed with her—forever in the past.
###Chapter 2

The wind outside the Civil Affairs Bureau was chilly.

Ethan Sinclair clutched the brand-new marriage certificate, his knuckles turning white. He dialed for the seventeenth time, but the mechanical female voice on the other end repeated, "The number you have dialed is currently unavailable..."

He glanced down at his pale wrist, the needle marks still bruised purple. The nurse’s alarmed voice echoed in his memory: "Sir, you can’t donate any more blood!"

Back at his apartment, he collapsed onto the couch and fell into a deep sleep.

The next day, the sharp scent of hospital disinfectant made his temples throb. Behind the glass window of the VIP ward, Victoria Montgomery stirred a bowl of plain congee, blowing on it gently before lifting the spoon to Lucas Whitmore’s lips.

Ethan leaned against the wall, suddenly remembering the time in his past life when he’d spiked a fever of 39°C—she’d only said over the phone, "You’re bothering me with something this trivial?"

The sharp rap of his knuckles against the door startled the occupants inside.

Victoria turned, the warmth in her eyes freezing over instantly. She strode out, shutting the door behind her, her voice barely above a whisper. "Are you stalking me now?"

Dark circles hung under her eyes, her lips chapped and peeling.

Ethan simply held out the beige handbag. "I came to return this."

"You’ve seen me. Now leave." She reached for the bag, but he pulled it back.

"And this." He flipped open the marriage certificate—inside was a photo of Victoria and Lucas.

Her pupils constricted. "Have you lost your mind? Lucas can’t handle any stress right now!" She snapped the document shut. "If he finds out I married you to save his life—"

"You married him," Ethan corrected. "I just picked up the certificate for you yesterday."

The elevator dinged open, nurses’ hushed whispers drifting out.

"Ms. Montgomery is so devoted. Rumor has it she flew in a medical team from Switzerland..."

"The blood donor was even more impressive—800cc in one go..."

Ethan pressed the button for the first floor. In his past life, he’d donated 1200cc and passed out in the blood bank. Now, his phone displayed an acceptance letter from a prestigious European design institute.

Fourteen years’ worth of "treasures" finally saw the light of day—stalker photos of her, discarded hair ties, candy wrappers she’d casually handed him... twenty-eight boxes in total.

As the housekeeper directed movers to haul them out, a black Maybach screeched to a halt at the gate.

The window rolled down, Victoria’s gaze sweeping over the boxes. "I told you—getting married doesn’t mean you can move in with me."

Ethan bent to pick up a fallen photograph. "These are for disposal."

"Get in the car," she said abruptly. "We’re filing for divorce."

When the rear door clicked open, Ethan caught the glint of the diamond on her ring finger—the rare pink stone Lucas had won at auction last year.

He smiled faintly. "Not possible."

"What do you mean?"

"Divorce requires a one-month waiting period after marriage." He shut the car door gently. "Perfect timing. My visa comes through next week."

As the Maybach’s taillights vanished around the corner, the housekeeper murmured, "Sir, these boxes—"

"Burn them."

Ethan pulled out his phone and deleted the contact pinned at the top for fourteen years. A light drizzle began to fall, but the flames stubbornly flickered in the rain—like the love he’d carried, unextinguished, until death in his past life.
###Chapter 3

"Last time at the Civil Affairs Bureau, we ran into a college classmate. Someone asked me about it." Victoria Montgomery tapped her fingers on the steering wheel. "There’s a reunion tonight. Lucas might hear rumors. You’re coming with me to clear things up."

Ethan Sinclair finally recalled the encounter outside the bureau.

In his past life, he’d been so smug he couldn’t keep his mouth shut, and the news spread like wildfire. This time, he’d stayed tight-lipped—yet somehow, word still got out.

The black sedan screeched to a halt in front of the club. Victoria slammed the car door shut, her heels clicking sharply against the steps.

"Remember, just say you were delivering your cousin’s ID." She turned abruptly, her red lips pressed into a thin line. "One word more, and you know what happens."

Ethan studied her tense profile and almost laughed.

"Relax. I’ll make it clear we didn’t get married." He paused. "Since that’s the truth."

When the private room door swung open, seven or eight pairs of eyes locked onto them.

"Ethan!" someone hooted. "Heard you and Victoria tied the knot! Where’s the invite?"

Calmly, he pulled out his household register. The "single" status glared under the lights.

"Just dropping off an ID." His tone was as casual as discussing the weather.

The room erupted in gasps.

"Bullshit!" A girl in a leopard-print dress slammed the table. "Everyone at Stanford knew what you did for her back then!"

Fragmented memories flashed through Ethan’s mind—the rose with morning dew outside the girls’ dorm at 6 a.m., the shadow lunging at him on the basketball court, the shredded grad school acceptance letter in the dean’s office…

"That’s all in the past," he said softly.

The chatter died instantly. At the entrance, Victoria walked in arm-in-arm with Lucas Whitmore. She wore a pearl-white dress that made him look even more slender beside her.

"Proposal?" Lucas’s ears turned pink. "Victoria, you—"

Her nails dug into her palms. She saw the mockery in Ethan’s eyes and the stars in Lucas’s.

"Yes," she heard herself say. "Lucas, I wanted to surprise you."
###Chapter 4

Lucas swept her into a spinning hug. The cheers shook the crystal chandelier. No one noticed Ethan in the corner, quietly slipping the marriage certificate back into his suit pocket.
The private room erupted in chaos.

"What a perfect day! Why not propose right now? We can all be witnesses!"

Victoria Montgomery's brow furrowed slightly.

"It's too rushed. We don't even have a ring or flowers."

Lucas Whitmore's voice trembled with excitement.

"Victoria, I'd say yes without any of that! Just give me the word."

Their gazes locked, electricity crackling between them.

In the corner, Ethan Sinclair felt a dull ache spread through his chest.

His fists clenched, nails digging deep into his palms.

Victoria was serious.

In this life or the last, even as his lawful wife, her heart had always belonged to Lucas.

Once, he'd naively believed his devotion could win her over.

Now reality crashed down upon him.

As Lucas pulled Victoria into an embrace, she murmured:

"You might not care, but I do. Give me thirty minutes."

With a phone call, her assistant arrived and transformed the space into a proposal setting.

Classmates eagerly helped arrange flowers, rings, and formal attire.

Before the ceremony began, Lucas approached Ethan with a camera.

"Our photographer canceled. I heard you're quite skilled. Would you capture this for us?"

Victoria shot Ethan a wary glance.

To everyone's surprise, he calmly accepted the camera.

"Of course. I'll document your happiness."

Victoria hesitated, then texted him:

"We're already married. This is just for Lucas. Ruin this and you'll regret it."

Ethan's lips twisted into a bitter smile as he read the message.

A man who'd died once wouldn't repeat his mistakes.

Through the viewfinder, he watched Victoria approach Lucas with roses.

Kneeling gracefully, her voice flowed like honey:

"Lucas, meeting you was my life's greatest blessing. Will you spend forever with me?"

Ethan's ears rang.

As Lucas slid on the ring, their kiss ignited cheers.

Ethan captured every moment with mechanical precision.

Afterward, he returned the camera to Lucas.

"Congratulations..."

A sudden scream cut him off.

An unseen force shoved him violently forward.

The champagne fountain toppled, glass shards embedding in his flesh.

Blood mingled with spilled liquor as agony consumed him.

Through fading consciousness, Victoria's frantic voice reached him:

"Lucas! I used him as a shield. Are you hurt?"

So she'd pushed him.

A ghastly smile crossed Ethan's ashen face.

Silent tears traced his cheeks.

Darkness swallowed him, carrying that final revelation into oblivion...
###Chapter 5

Ethan Sinclair struggled to open his eyes. The sharp scent of disinfectant assaulted his senses.

A nurse adjusted his IV drip and offered a professional smile when she noticed he was awake.

"Should we notify your family? Parents or a spouse?"

His chapped lips parted, his throat raw as sandpaper.

"My parents are gone. No wife. I'm unmarried."

The hospital door swung open abruptly.

Victoria Montgomery strode in on stilettos, her flawless makeup failing to mask the irritation in her eyes.

"Unmarried? Who was the man begging me on his knees to go to the Civil Affairs Bureau last week?"

Ethan closed his eyes, exhausted.

"Check the name on the marriage certificate."

Victoria scoffed, her red nails tapping an impatient rhythm against her leather purse.

"Ethan Sinclair, if Lucas didn’t need your blood type, do you think I’d spare you a second glance?"

She stepped closer, her perfume making his temples throb.

"I just wanted to give Lucas the perfect proposal. It won’t affect your title as Mr. Montgomery. Stop playing the victim."

Ethan opened his eyes, his gaze eerily calm.

"Do as you please. Proposal, wedding, honeymoon—none of it concerns me. Just let me go."

Victoria narrowed her eyes, then suddenly laughed.

She leaned down, her red lips nearly brushing his ear.

"So you love me that much? Willing to give up your status?"

Silence swallowed the room.

After a long moment, she straightened and tossed a black card onto the bed.

"Two million. Compensation for taking those drinks for Lucas yesterday. From now on, we each get what we need. You’ll be his walking blood bank, and I’ll ensure you never want for anything."

The click of her heels faded down the hallway.

Ethan stared at the ceiling, too drained to call after her.

On the third day of his hospitalization, a nurse brought him his phone.

The screen unlocked to a flood of updates from Lucas Whitmore’s social media.

Azure seas and skies framed Victoria adjusting Lucas’s straw hat on her tiptoes.

A Ferris wheel lifted them to the sunset, their lips meeting in a kiss.

On horseback, her hands guided his around the reins.

In every photo, her smile was sickeningly sweet.

Ethan swiped through the images, memories crashing over him like a tide.

In their seven-year marriage in his past life, he’d been nothing but a pitiful puppet.

Braving rain at 3 AM to deliver stomach medicine, only to be barred by bodyguards outside her mansion.

Three months of cooking lessons rewarded with a single command: "Throw it out."

A carefully planned anniversary shattered by her own hands because Lucas frowned.

Reborn, he finally understood.

Some people could never be warmed.

Some affections could never be forced.

From this day forward, the name Victoria Montgomery would be erased from his world.
###Chapter 6

Ethan Sinclair stood at the hospital entrance, squinting against the harsh sunlight. Tomorrow, he would fly overseas. He pulled out his phone and sent party invitations to his childhood friends.

Inside the KTV private room, the guys were belting out songs at the top of their lungs. Ethan leaned back on the couch, watching their antics with a faint smile.

Dinner was at their usual Sichuan restaurant, the spice making them sweat. Later, they moved to a café, chatting until the city lights flickered to life before finally parting ways.

As Ethan paid the bill, the server mentioned another tab from the neighboring room. Remembering his forgotten bag, he turned back.

Then he froze mid-step at the sound of a shrill voice through the half-open door.

"Who does Ethan Sinclair think he is?" The words cut like glass. "Chasing after Victoria Montgomery for years, only to lose to our Lucas in the end."

"Did you see the way he forced a smile while filming Lucas’ proposal? Priceless. Should’ve made it a meme."

Ethan’s fingers tightened unconsciously. Through the gap, he saw Lucas Whitmore lounging with crossed legs, a victor’s smirk on his face.

"Don’t compare him to me," Lucas scoffed, swirling his coffee cup. "He’s not even in my league."

Silently, Ethan pulled out his phone and hit record. The mockery continued.

"The Sinclairs’ fortune is pocket change next to the Montgomery Group. Victoria only has eyes for Lucas. Where does Ethan rank?"

Someone suddenly lowered their voice. "Hey, Lucas, about that blood transfusion after your car accident—"

Lucas cut them off lazily. "Victoria called him. Who knows what she promised." His smile turned icy. "Next time I need blood, I’ll have her summon him. If he gets in my way, I’ll just ‘accidentally’ get hurt more often. Drain him dry."

A chill shot down Ethan’s spine. So those "accidents" in his past life were deliberate murders.

He bit his lip until copper flooded his mouth. His nails dug into his palms, but he felt no pain.

A phone rang abruptly. Lucas stood and walked out. Ethan ducked behind a pillar, catching a muffled mention of an "ex-girlfriend" from inside.

Instinct made him follow.

In the fire escape stairwell, Lucas was grappling with a short-haired girl.

"Sophia Reynolds, I told you to stay away!"

"You’re getting married? To Victoria?" Her voice trembled. "We grew up together, and you’re dumping me to climb the social ladder?"

Lucas sneered. "Victoria is the Montgomery heiress. And you? Broke as a joke. If you loved me, you’d let me go."

"Let you go?" Her pitch spiked. "Does she know you’ve been two-timing? That you were in my bed last night?"

Ethan’s breath hitched. His phone slipped from his fingers, clattering loudly in the silent hallway.
###Chapter 7

Ethan Sinclair's fingers had just touched his phone screen when Lucas Whitmore's piercing scream shattered the hallway's silence.

His entire body jolted, and he quickly shoved the phone into his pocket.

By the time he returned to the private room, his palms were slick with cold sweat, his heart pounding as if trying to escape his chest.

The recording had been saved. He checked the time, grabbed his briefcase, and prepared to leave.

The moment he pushed open the café door, Lucas stood blocking the exit with four burly men, his gaze dark and venomous.

"It was you eavesdropping, wasn't it?"

Ethan's blood ran cold.

Lucas smirked as he stepped closer, his polished shoes clicking against the floor in a suffocating rhythm.

"You think a little recording can threaten me?" He suddenly gripped Ethan's chin, fingers digging in. "Victoria will only believe me."

Before Ethan could react, Lucas had already dialed Victoria Montgomery's number.

"Victoria, I feel dizzy... Can you come get me?"

After hanging up, Lucas gave a subtle nod, and Ethan was dragged back into the private room.

The lock clicked shut, and fists rained down on him like a storm.

Someone yanked his hair, slamming his skull against the wall. The dull thud of bone meeting plaster echoed in his ears.

Warm liquid trickled down his temple, his vision blurring with crimson.

"You piece of trash!" Lucas kicked him hard in the stomach. "Dare to ruin my plans?"

Amid the agony, a phone rang.

Lucas signaled for the beating to stop, leisurely pouring a cup of scalding coffee.

The boiling liquid splashed over Ethan's wounds. He bit his lip bloody to stifle a scream.

"Victoria..." Lucas's voice suddenly cracked with fake tears. "Ethan cornered me on the third floor..."

Ethan struggled to crawl toward the door, only to be dragged back by his ankle.

A sharp slap rang out just as the door was kicked open.

"Victoria!" Lucas clutched his face and threw himself into her arms. "He hit me..."

Victoria's gaze locked onto Lucas's swollen cheek, her eyes turning to ice.

"Ethan Sinclair!"

"It wasn't me—" Ethan's words were cut short as a bodyguard slammed him to the floor.

"Thirty slaps," Victoria said coldly. "Not one less."

The first strike filled his mouth with the taste of iron.

By the fifth, his left ear buzzed with static.

At the fifteenth, his vision blurred beyond recognition.

When the final slap landed, he heard Victoria's icy voice: "If there's a next time, I'll bury the Sinclairs with you."

Curled on the floor, Ethan watched their retreating figures, tears mingling with blood as they hit the ground.
###Chapter 8

Ethan Sinclair dragged his battered body back to the villa. The heavy door slammed shut behind him with a dull thud.

He locked himself in his room for three whole days.

His suitcase lay open on the floor. He mechanically stuffed clothes inside, folding each piece with meticulous precision—as if that could somehow mend his shattered heart.

On the fourth morning, he called the real estate agent.

"I need to sell this villa. As soon as possible."

The agent on the other end hesitated. "Mr. Sinclair, are you sure? The market isn’t great right now—"

"Sell it at the lowest price," he interrupted, his voice hoarse.

His parents had settled in Europe years ago. This villa was the only thing they’d left him. But now, he just wanted to escape this place—this prison of memories.

The transfer process was swift. By evening, he walked out of the agency with a thin contract in hand. The setting sun stretched his shadow long behind him.

The villa district had a blackout. Ethan fumbled through the dark path when suddenly, blinding headlights pierced the night.

The roar of an engine shattered the silence.

He instinctively raised a hand to shield his eyes—only to see the black car accelerating straight toward him.

"Bang—"

Agony exploded through his body. He was flung like a ragdoll, crashing onto the cold concrete.

Blood trickled from the corner of his mouth. Gritting his teeth, he lifted his head—and saw the twisted face behind the wheel.

Sophia Reynolds.

Lucas Whitmore’s ex-girlfriend.

Ethan wanted to laugh, but coughed up blood instead. So this was karma?

As his vision blurred, he heard screeching brakes. Someone rushed to his side. The familiar scent of perfume filled his nose.

Victoria Montgomery.

He strained to see her face—but only caught the sight of her walking away.

When he woke again, harsh white light made him wince. The sterile smell told him he was in a hospital.

"The patient has multiple fractures and internal bleeding. He needs immediate surgery!"

"No." Victoria’s voice was ice. "Draw his blood first. Lucas needs a transfusion."

The doctor stared at her in shock. "This patient has lost too much blood. Any more could be fatal!"

"I’ll sign the waiver," she said without hesitation. "Lucas can’t wait."

The moment the needle pierced his vein, Ethan jolted fully awake. His blood flowed through the transparent tube, drop by drop.

So this was what a broken heart felt like.

"How tragic..." a nurse whispered. "A wife draining her husband’s blood for another man..."

A single tear slid down silently.

He closed his eyes and listened to the sound of his life slipping away.

If he could do it all over again, he’d rather have never met the girl named Victoria Montgomery.
###Chapter 9

Ethan Sinclair's consciousness drifted in darkness.

When he finally managed to open his eyes, the blinding white light made him instinctively squint. The sharp scent of disinfectant filled his nose, and the IV fluid dripped steadily from the bag above him.

"You're awake?" A nurse's delighted voice reached him. "You were unconscious for three whole days. It's a miracle you pulled through."

He stared blankly at the ceiling, unable to tell if this was a dream or reality. Only when a dull ache throbbed in his chest did he realize—he had truly survived.

"Don't move." The nurse pressed down on his arm as he tried to lift it. "You lost too much blood. You need rest."

Ethan lay still, letting her change his bandages. Sunlight streamed through the window, casting bright reflections on the white sheets, making his eyes sting.

The days in the hospital passed quietly. He hired a caretaker to assist him, dutifully taking his medication and undergoing check-ups. The doctors said he was recovering well, but each time they examined him, they hesitated before speaking.

"Your family..." one finally ventured. "Why hasn’t anyone come to visit?"

Ethan turned his gaze to the window, his voice soft. "I don’t have any."

His phone buzzed. A photo from Lucas Whitmore appeared—Victoria Montgomery feeding him fruit, both of them smiling sweetly. Ethan swiped the notification away without reaction and returned to his book.

On the day of his discharge, the sun was unusually bright. Just as he finished packing, his phone rang.

"Mr. Sinclair, your visa has been approved."

The corners of his lips lifted slightly. "I’ll come pick it up today."

As he hung up, the door opened behind him. Victoria stood there, her brows furrowed. "You’re leaving the country?"

Ethan’s smile faded. He turned back to his suitcase. "Not your concern."

"How is it not?" Her voice rose. "We’re still married!"

"I’ve already signed the divorce papers." He didn’t look up. "We can go to the Civil Affairs Bureau anytime."

Victoria let out a cold laugh. "You think this will make me pay attention?" She tossed an invitation onto the bed. "Lucas and I are getting married tomorrow. You will be there."

Ethan picked up the invitation, his fingers trembling faintly. "I’ll be there on time."

His immediate agreement caught her off guard. She opened her mouth to speak, but her phone rang. After a brief call, she threw out a hurried, "Don’t forget to move into the villa," before leaving.

Ethan stood by the window, watching her disappear beyond the hospital gates. Sunlight fell across his pale face, revealing a faint, relieved smile.

That afternoon, he collected his visa and mailed a carefully prepared package. As the courier took the box, he murmured, "Deliver it to this address tomorrow at noon. Tell her... I wish her a happy wedding."

The next morning, Ethan wheeled his suitcase into the airport. Before boarding, he took one last look at the city, then deleted every contact without hesitation.

As the plane soared into the sky, he leaned against the window and closed his eyes. The cabin was silent except for the hum of the engines. This time, he was finally free of that nightmare.
###Chapter 10
When sunlight broke through the clouds and bathed his face, Ethan thought—This is true rebirth.
The first light of dawn barely touched the sky when Victoria Montgomery drove to Lucas Whitmore's apartment.

Lucas answered the door in his pajamas, drowsily collapsing into her arms. "Victoria, do you really think Ethan Sinclair will come?"

She ran her fingers through his tousled hair and whispered in his ear, "Of course. Haven't you always wanted him to witness this?"

"You're the best." Lucas tilted his face up, eyes shimmering with anticipation.

The makeup room lights were harsh. Victoria checked her phone for the third time—Ethan's chat window remained empty. She dialed his number, only to hear the automated voice announce his phone was switched off.

Crystal chandeliers cast fractured reflections across the room. Victoria stood at the end of the red carpet, her gaze repeatedly darting to the closed doors.

On the opposite end, Lucas adjusted his tie, his crisp suit making her heart skip for a fleeting moment.

The emcee cleared his throat for the third time. The minute hand on Victoria's watch had already moved halfway around the dial.

"We can't wait any longer." Lucas strode over, his grip on her hand trembling slightly.

The sudden crash of the doors swinging open made Victoria's heart stop. A courier stood in the entrance, holding a cardboard box, causing murmurs to ripple through the crowd.

"Mr. Ethan Sinclair requested this be delivered at this exact time." The courier shoved the box into her hands and hurried away.

By the time Lucas reached her, Victoria had already torn open the packaging. Two crimson marriage certificates lay at the bottom, accompanied by a silver flash drive.

"When did you—" Lucas snatched the documents, his voice cracking mid-sentence.

Victoria stared at Lucas' name printed on the certificate, her fingertips turning cold. That day at the Civil Affairs Bureau, Ethan had clearly—

"Let's see what's on the flash drive!" Lucas tugged her excitedly toward the center of the stage.

The guests' applause surged like a tidal wave, but all Victoria could hear was the violent pounding of her own heart. The moment the projector flickered to life, she couldn't bring herself to look at the screen.
###Chapter 11

Victoria Montgomery's fingertips turned icy as the USB drive was handed to her on the altar.

She slowly inserted it into the laptop. The entire banquet hall held its breath, anticipating the sweet wedding video.

"Does he even deserve this?"

Lucas Whitmore's venomous voice suddenly exploded through the speakers.

Victoria froze mid-motion.

"Wait till I drain his blood and turn him into ashes..."

Every word from the recording stabbed into Victoria's eardrums like knives.

She'd never heard Lucas speak with such malice before.

"Turn it off! Now!"

Lucas charged toward the stage but was restrained by security.

Victoria's gaze grew colder by the second.

The recording continued, revealing Lucas boasting about exploiting the Montgomery family's influence.

"What's wrong with climbing the social ladder?"

An unfamiliar female voice cut in: "Does Victoria know we slept together last night?"

Crack!

The USB drive shattered against the marble floor.

"Explain." Victoria's voice could freeze hell.

Lucas turned ghostly pale. "It's fabricated! Ethan Sinclair framed me!"

"Ethan?" Mrs. Montgomery stood abruptly. "I always said he was trouble!"

Hearing Ethan's name, Lucas erupted. "That worthless bastard!"

Boom!

The banquet doors burst open.

Sophia Reynolds stormed in with red roses. "Lucas, come with me!"

Camera flashes erupted like fireworks.

"I don't know her!" Lucas shoved Sophia away.

"What was last night then?" Sophia sneered.

Victoria finally snapped. "Security!"

Chaos engulfed the venue.

The butler rushed in. "Sir! Madam! Emergency!"

Mrs. Montgomery collapsed upon seeing the trending hashtag #MontgomeryWeddingScandal.

"Call an ambulance!"

Lucas tried to follow but was pinned by Victoria's glacial stare.

Rose petals clung to his disheveled suit like bloodstains.

The guests' whispers coiled around him like venomous snakes.

This was all Ethan's doing.

Lucas bit through his lip, eyes burning with hatred.
###Chapter 12

Ethan Sinclair had barely unlocked his phone when social media notifications flooded in. Frowning, he scrolled through the screen—every headline screamed about the chaos at Victoria Montgomery’s wedding.

"Lucas Whitmore’s ex-girlfriend crashes the ceremony."

"The bride storms out in the middle of vows."

His finger froze over one particular update: Mrs. Montgomery collapses at the scene, rushed to the hospital. Ethan’s breath hitched. That gentle woman who always made him soup, who chided him with, Ethan, you need to eat on time.

He locked his phone with a sharp click. The past should stay buried, just like this darkened screen.

When submitting his resume, Ethan hesitated over the send button. Finally, he applied for a design position at Santa, attaching the very piece that had become his professional disgrace—his graduation project, completed at 3 AM, now a permanent stain on his career.

"Your portfolio is… unique," the interviewer adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "But this style—"

The conference room door swung open. An assistant hurried in, whispering into the interviewer’s ear. Ethan watched as the man’s brows lifted in surprise before extending a hand. "Nine AM tomorrow. Welcome to Santa."

Even with the employee badge hanging around his neck, Ethan still couldn’t believe it. In the break room, he was searching for information on Isabella Laurent when someone bumped into him from behind.

"Careful."

Coffee splashed across the woman’s beige blazer, leaving dark stains. Ethan scrambled for napkins, but she simply shrugged off the jacket, revealing a silk blouse underneath. "As long as no one’s burned," she said, bending to pick up his fallen phone.

The screen still displayed Isabella’s Wikipedia photo. By the time Ethan looked up, all he caught was the swish of a skirt disappearing around the corner.

Late at night, only two lights remained in the office. On his third glance toward that dim corner, Ethan finally walked over. The swivel chair turned, revealing Isabella’s exhausted face, dark circles stark under the fluorescent lights.

"About last time—"

"Planning to buy me dinner as an apology?" She shut her laptop. Her wristwatch showed 11 PM. "Good timing. I know a place that’s open all night."

As the foie gras melted on his tongue, Isabella suddenly asked, "Why give up opportunities back home?" Ethan’s knife slipped, screeching against the porcelain plate.

His mind flashed to graduation day. Two nearly identical designs side by side on the projector. Lucas waving the original sketches, accusing him of theft. Victoria clinging to her fiancé’s arm, sneering, A plagiarist has no right to call themselves a designer.

"Paris is better for a fresh start," Ethan swallowed the bitterness. He didn’t notice the way Isabella’s fingers traced the rim of her glass, as if confirming something long forgotten.
###Chapter 13

Victoria Montgomery sat by the hospital bed, her fingertips lightly brushing her mother's pale face. Since the wedding fiasco, Mrs. Montgomery's condition had taken a sharp turn for the worse, and she had only just been moved out of the ICU today.

Three soft knocks sounded at the door.

Her assistant entered, holding a file.

"Did you find him?" Victoria rubbed her temples.

"Mr. Sinclair is in France," the assistant said, handing her the documents. "He's now the head designer at Santa."

Victoria stared at the familiar name on the file, her fingers trembling slightly. "Book a flight. As soon as possible."

The moment she stepped out of the hospital building, a dark figure lunged at her. Lucas Whitmore clung to her desperately, still wearing the same wrinkled suit from the wedding day.

"Victoria..." His voice was hoarse. "Why won't you answer my calls?"

She shoved him away, her gaze icy. "My mother is lying in a hospital bed. Do you really think I have the patience for you right now?"

"I'm your husband!" Lucas suddenly raised his voice, gripping her wrist. "We're legally married!"

"Married?" Victoria sneered. "A certificate obtained through deceit doesn't count as a marriage."

Lucas's expression darkened. "You're bringing up Ethan again? Didn't you say you hated him the most?"

"My life is none of your business." She wrenched her hand free.

"None of my business?" Lucas suddenly laughed, the sound twisted. "If you hadn't allowed it, how could I have driven him away? The hospital blood bank clearly—"

"Shut up!" Victoria seized his throat.

Lucas's face turned red, but he kept laughing. "You're worse than me... You were the one who—"

"Victoria!"

A shocked cry came from behind. She turned to see her mother standing on the steps, her face deathly pale. The next second, Mrs. Montgomery stumbled and fell down the staircase.
###Chapter 14

The Parisian night draped over the streets as Ethan Sinclair stood beneath the streetlamp, the warm yellow light tracing the sharp contours of his profile. He took a sip of coffee, his slender fingers absently tracing the rim of the cup.

Victoria Montgomery’s footsteps echoed distinctly in the quiet street. She yanked open the car door, the click of her heels sharp against the cobblestones.

"Ethan Sinclair!"

The familiar voice made Ethan jerk his head up. Instinctively, he tried to pull his wrist free from her grip but froze when he recognized her.

"Ms. Montgomery?" A mocking smile curled his lips. "Shouldn’t you be on your honeymoon with Lucas Whitmore right now?"

Her nails dug into his skin. "Why are you leaving?"

Ethan shook her off, coffee splashing between them. "Victoria, when were we ever together?"

"You promised to marry me!" Her voice trembled in the night breeze. "Even if the wedding was with Lucas, our names were still on the marriage certificate!"

Ethan suddenly laughed, the sound sending a chill down her spine.

"Didn’t you look closely at the certificate?" He leisurely pulled a photo from his pocket. "See for yourself. Whose names are on it?"

The photo showed a bright red marriage certificate, Lucas Whitmore and Victoria Montgomery’s names glaringly side by side.

"You did this?" Her pupils constricted. "Didn’t you always want to marry me?"

Ethan tucked the photo away, his gaze icy. "Your memory is terrible, Ms. Montgomery. Who was it that said only Lucas deserved to be your husband?"

"That was just anger talking!" She grabbed his collar. "You sent those photos to the wedding because you still love me, didn’t you?"

Ethan pried her fingers off one by one. "I just wanted you to taste the humiliation of being exposed in public."

The streetlamp stretched their shadows long across the pavement. Victoria suddenly remembered that rainy night in college, Ethan kneeling outside the infirmary.

"Do you remember when I made you kneel all night?" Her voice cracked. "I was just—"

"Just what?" He cut her off. "Just used to treating me like a dog at your beck and call?"

Her lips trembled, but no retort came.

"My mother is in the hospital," she blurted.

Ethan took a step back. "And? Did I force you to cheat with Lucas in the dressing room?"

Just then, a slender figure slipped between them. Isabella Laurent looped her arm through Ethan’s, offering Victoria a polite smile.

"Miss, we have plans."

Ethan smoothly wrapped an arm around Isabella’s waist. "Let me introduce you. My girlfriend."

Victoria’s face drained of color. She watched them walk away, her nails biting into her palms.

Around the corner, Ethan immediately dropped his arm. "Sorry about that—"

"No need to explain." Isabella opened the car door. "Get in. I’ll drive you."

As the engine roared to life, she added, "There’s a fashion week next week. Want to be my plus-one?"

Ethan’s eyes lit up. "I’d love to."

Isabella smirked and hit the gas. In the rearview mirror, Victoria’s figure grew smaller until it vanished into the Parisian night.
###Chapter 15

The divorce papers were drafted quickly. Victoria Montgomery stared at the documents for a long time.

A new dumpling shop had opened near the hospital, its savory aroma drifting through the air. She pushed the door open and ordered a seafood-filled portion.

The first bite made her fingers tremble at the familiar taste.

Every Friday without fail, Ethan Sinclair used to make her dumplings from scratch. She'd always dismissed them as bothersome, handing them off to her assistant. Only once, when an intern spilled her dinner, had she reluctantly tried them.

"Boss, did you change the recipe?" a customer at the next table asked.

An aproned middle-aged man emerged from the kitchen. "A young man helped out here years ago and tweaked the formula."

Victoria's chopsticks froze mid-air.

"That kid had it rough," the owner said, wiping his hands. "No big company would hire him back then. Worked here for half a year."

She looked up sharply. "What was his name?"

"Sinclair, I think. Handsome fellow."

Her phone gallery yielded no photos of Ethan—only pictures with Lucas Whitmore. She deleted them all in frustration.

Her assistant's investigation came through swiftly. The photo showed Ethan in a shop uniform, diligently folding dumplings.

"Why didn't he come to Montgomery Group?" Her voice sounded hollow.

The assistant hesitated. "You ordered his professional blacklist..."

The memory surfaced with sudden clarity. Lucas had whined about competition, and she'd casually destroyed Ethan's career prospects. What had Ethan said in response? She hadn't even bothered to listen.

"I don't mind," the young man would always smile. "If you feel guilty, just be with me."

"Keep dreaming," had been her constant reply.

Her phone vibrated violently. When the unknown number called for the third time, she finally answered.

"Ms. Montgomery! Someone's forcing their way into the VIP ward!"

She arrived to find Sophia Reynolds waving a USB drive at her pale mother. "Your daughter's kept a pretty boy while using Ethan as a blood bag!"

The laptop crashed to the floor as her mother swayed.

"Get out!" Victoria yanked Sophia away.

Her mother pushed her aside, tears falling. "I failed to raise you right—"

The heart monitor suddenly shrieked an alarm.
###Chapter 16

The backstage of the runway show was brightly lit. When Isabella Laurent introduced Ethan Sinclair to several international designers, his sketches were passed around, eliciting gasps of amazement.

"Incredible!"
"Such rare creativity!"
"Ms. Laurent, where did you unearth this treasure?"

Ethan’s ears burned slightly. He lifted his champagne glass to hide his discomfort, the bubbles dancing merrily in the golden liquid.

"I’m really happy today," he said, pouring himself another drink. "Thank you for bringing me here, Ms. Laurent."

Isabella reached out and pressed her fingers over his wrist. "That’s enough."

But Ethan stubbornly pushed her hand away. "I’m celebrating. Won’t you join me?"

Under the lights, Isabella noticed the flush on his cheeks, like clouds tinted by sunset. She didn’t stop him again, simply watching as he refilled his glass.

"Isabella..." The alcohol made his voice float. "Why are you so good to me?"

After his rebirth, he had seen through Victoria Montgomery’s false affection, but Isabella’s sincerity remained a mystery. The closer he got, the more she confused him.

Her lashes cast delicate shadows under the lights. She only stared at him, silent as an autumn lake.

The streets were unusually quiet after the snowfall. Isabella supported the slightly tipsy Ethan as they walked back, the snow crunching beneath their feet. At the apartment building, she realized she’d left her phone at the bar.

"Wait here," she said, releasing his arm.

Ethan tilted his head back, watching the snowflakes drift down. How long had he been in France? Lost in thought, he suddenly felt a sharp grip on his wrist.

"We need to talk."

Victoria’s voice sliced through the peaceful night like a blade.

The cold wind sobered Ethan instantly. He tried to pull away, but she clung to him desperately.

"I was wrong..." Her voice trembled. "I’ve always loved you. Come back with me. France’s winter is too cold..."

Ethan’s body stiffened like ice.

"I’ll punish Lucas. I won’t hurt you again..." Her tears soaked into his collar.

"Punish him?" Ethan scoffed. "Wasn’t all of this your doing?"

Victoria’s sobs cut off abruptly.

"Do you know what I’m doing now?" Ethan’s voice turned light, almost playful.

"I do! You’re Santa’s designer—"

"But do you know my dream?" He leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "If I go back with you, will you make it come true?"

"I will! I’ll give you all the best resources—"

Ethan pressed a finger to her lips. He studied the face that had once haunted his dreams—now unshaven, disheveled.

"No, you won’t." He pulled back. "Thanks to you, I don’t even have a degree back home. How would I access your connections?"

Victoria’s face drained of color.

"France’s winter is cold," Ethan murmured, "but staying by your side was colder."

He stumbled back—right into Isabella’s arms.

Victoria’s gaze flickered to the woman who had appeared out of nowhere. "You’ve moved on?"

"Moved on?" Ethan laced his fingers through Isabella’s. "This is my girlfriend."

As they climbed the stairs, Isabella glanced down at her hand, a bitter smile touching her lips. She turned it over, as if she could still feel the warmth of his touch.

At home, Ethan collapsed onto the sofa. His keys slipped from his pocket—Isabella’s. A knock sounded at the door.

Assuming it was her coming to retrieve them, he opened it—only to find Victoria standing there.

"You were lying, weren’t you?" Her eyes were dark. "If she’s your girlfriend, why didn’t she stay the night?"

Ethan smirked. "Not everyone is as twisted as you."

"I’m not—" Her voice cracked. "My mother... she’s dead."

Ethan’s breath hitched.

"Lucas and Sophia... they showed her the video..." Victoria slid to the floor. "Is this my punishment?"

Outside, Isabella stood silently. She watched Victoria leave, then turned—only to meet Ethan’s searching gaze.

"I came for my keys," she said, rubbing her nose awkwardly.

Ethan didn’t call her out. "Can you answer my question now?"

"What question?"

"You’d seen my work before." He took a step closer. "You were there at that competition, weren’t you?"

Isabella smiled. "You finally remembered?"

"Why did you believe in me? Even the judges said that piece was flawed."

"If you don’t know Isabella," she whispered, "what about Aggie?"

Ethan froze as if struck by lightning. Memories surged—the little girl who used to climb the apple tree next to his grandmother’s house.

"Aggie?"

"The letters from middle school were torn up by the orphanage staff..." Her voice wavered. "I searched for you for so long."

Suddenly, Ethan remembered his online collaborator—AG. Aggie’s initials.

"The Apple Beyond the Tree was our creation." Isabella’s eyes gleamed like stars. "How could I not believe in you?"

The snow had stopped. Moonlight streamed through the window, stretching their shadows long across the floor.
###Chapter 17

Rain slanted against the tombstone. Victoria Montgomery's fingers trembled as she wiped droplets from her mother's photograph.

"Mom, I'm home."

She leaned against the cold granite, rainwater tracing paths down her cheeks. Her mother's frail voice echoed in her memory: "Promise me... don't go looking for Ethan again..."

"I broke my promise." Victoria pressed her forehead to the stone. "I couldn't help myself."

The downpour intensified, triggering memories of another stormy day. Lucas Whitmore had stood beside her, smirking. "Ethan, what kind of 'life' is this withered rose of yours?"

She'd thrown Ethan's designs into the rain herself. Water dripped from his lashes, but he never spoke.

Just like the countless days afterward, when he never said another word to her.

The car door jerked open while raindrops still clung to Victoria's fingertips.

"Surprise?" Lucas waved their marriage certificate. "I'm here to take you home."

Victoria seized his collar. "You dare come here?"

"It was Sophia who killed your mother!" Lucas struggled. "I had nothing to do with it!"

Her phone vibrated. The files from her assistant revealed everything - forged medical records, photos of school bullying, surveillance stills from the accident scene.

Most damning was the truth about that high school car crash. Sophia had aimed for Ethan, but took his parents instead.

"Let's start over." Victoria's sudden smile chilled the air. "After we settle accounts."

Lucas nodded eagerly until she shoved him into the car.

"This is... the hospital?" His voice shook.

"Remember?" Victoria killed the engine. "Ethan donated his Rh-null blood for you here."

Lucas turned ashen. Buried memories surfaced - stealing Ethan's design awards, orchestrating the crash through Sophia, even using Victoria to hurt him.

"Get out." Her voice cut colder than the rain.

The abandoned school's rusted gates creaked in the wind. Lucas finally recognized the crash site.

"Victoria, I—"

"Kneel." She pointed across the empty field where Ethan's parents' car had once parked. "Facing that direction."

Through the curtain of rain, Lucas finally saw the hatred in Victoria's eyes. Not misplaced anger at Sophia, but pure fury for him - the architect of all their tragedies.

"You owe him." Victoria raised her phone. "Now pay up."
###Chapter 18

Lucas Whitmore was yanked out of the car by Victoria Montgomery, stumbling onto the roadside. He stared blankly as she double-checked her phone, then ordered him to stay put.

"Stay right here." Her voice was icy before she turned and walked toward the red Panamera.

His phone buzzed in his pocket. Lucas pulled it out to see an image Victoria had sent—a yellowed newspaper clipping.

It was a report dated May 12, 2007, detailing a rear-end collision caused by illegal parking outside S High School.

His fingers trembled. A deafening buzz filled his ears, like a swarm of bees. Frantically, he tried to call her, but the moment he pressed the dial button, the familiar roar of an engine cut through the air.

He looked up just as the red sports car screeched to a halt inches from him, so close he could see his own reflection in the chrome grille.

His legs gave out, and he collapsed onto the pavement.

"Killing you now would be too merciful." Victoria loomed over him, her shadow swallowing him whole. "Everything you did to Ethan, I'll return tenfold."

The car sped through the night. Lucas slumped in the backseat, no longer caring about their destination. He knew Victoria was keeping him alive for one reason only—to make him pay for Ethan Sinclair.

Time blurred. When the car finally stopped, his vision swam as he watched Victoria step out and speak to a figure in a white coat.

The shock from earlier had left him disoriented. Fragments of conversation drifted through the cracked window.

"Coagulation disorder... bloodletting therapy..."

The words stabbed into his skull like needles. Lucas jolted awake, shoving the car door open in panic.

Victoria exchanged a glance with the doctor. She gave a slight nod. "Begin."

Nurses materialized out of nowhere, pinning his wrists down. A cold needle pricked his neck, and the world spun violently.

Before darkness swallowed him, Victoria's voice echoed from somewhere far away—

"Atone properly for Ethan."

It was colder than Arctic ice.

Atone? Lucas laughed bitterly in the void. The one who should atone was Ethan Sinclair! If not for him, his life would never have turned out this way.
###Chapter 19

Ethan Sinclair gradually settled into the rhythm of life here. After work, he often strolled down the streets, hand in hand with Isabella Laurent.

They were officially together now. Ethan loved asking Isabella about every little detail of her past, and she never tired of repeating those old stories.

"Why do you always want to hear these old tales?" Isabella tilted her head, curious.

Ethan pulled her closer. "Back then, my eyes were only on Victoria Montgomery. I missed so much beauty. Now I want to reclaim those memories."

Truthfully, he wanted to make amends. Back then, he hadn’t noticed the girl who had silently stood by him all along.

Isabella nuzzled into his chest like a pampered kitten. Ethan couldn’t resist ruffling her hair.

"Tell me again," she said, shaking his arm playfully. "Tell me how you found me in that pile of apples..."

Time flowed quietly by. With Isabella’s help, Ethan completed his design course ahead of schedule. Now, he was a rising star in the industry.

He secretly planned to launch his own brand. The past was behind them, and the future awaited their story.

Isabella fully supported his dreams, encouraging him to chase them boldly.

Late at night, Ethan sometimes felt a pang of guilt. He had almost lost his Aggie forever.

"But we’re together now," Isabella cupped his face. "Aggie is happy. She doesn’t feel wronged at all."

Ethan was grateful fate had given him a second chance. And even more grateful that this time, he held tight to the treasure he had almost lost.

Isabella pressed a soft kiss to his forehead. "We have a long, long future ahead of us."

"We will."

It was Aggie and Ethan’s promise. It was Isabella and Ethan’s vow.
###Chapter 20

Lucas Whitmore groped through the darkness. His fingertips brushed against icy walls still reeking of antiseptic. This private ward had been his prison for thirty-seven days.

Victoria Montgomery's revenge proved crueler than imagined. Three daily blood draws left his arms studded with needle marks. IV drips maintained only the barest flicker of life. The worst was the automated phlebotomy machine—triggering whenever his blood volume showed any recovery.

"How much blood does Ethan Sinclair need?" he'd once rasped at a nurse. Silence answered him, followed by another needle piercing his vein.

Tonight's surveillance system glitched for three minutes. Lucas gnawed through his wrist restraints with his teeth. The IV tore free, scattering blood droplets like rubies. He didn't pause to stanch the flow, bare feet slapping against frigid tiles.

The hospital's rear alarm had long since failed. When Lucas crashed through the iron gate, night wind carried the scent of freedom. He staggered into the darkness, unaware of the black Maybach parked nearby—where Victoria sipped Bordeaux while watching his escape.

"The prey has fled its cage," she murmured into her phone, lips curling. "Your turn now, Miss Reynolds."

Neon lights painted Sophia Reynolds' face in fractured colors. She polished a whiskey glass with mechanical precision, her prosthetic eye glinting unnaturally. Three months ago, violence had stolen both her sight and her standing in Stanford's elite circles.

The phone's vibration nearly shattered the tumbler in her grip.

"Victoria?" Sophia's voice dripped frost. "You dare contact me?"

The clink of wine meeting crystal echoed through the receiver. "Room 1608, The Rosewood Hotel." Victoria's tone oozed honeyed venom. "Your tormentor is coming to you."

Lucas' vision swam as he flagged down a taxi. He never noticed the driver's black gloves. "Hospital..." The word dissolved into unconsciousness.

He awoke spread-eagled on a bed. Sophia straddled his waist, tears leaking from her hollowed socket.

"Remember this?" She raised a glass ashtray crusted with old blood. "You smashed my eye with it."

Duct tape muffled Lucas' screams. When Sophia lifted her nightgown, he recoiled at his own name tattooed across her abdomen.

"Victoria was right." She slit the tape with a fruit knife. "The sweetest revenge is making you dance like a puppet too."

Blood trickled from Lucas' mouth. As Sophia leaned closer, he headbutted her nose with a sickening crunch. Glass shattered as he wrenched free from the ropes.

"You think you can run?" Sophia laughed through crimson streams. "This whole floor belongs to the Montgomerys!"

Lucas froze at the door. Through the peephole, two black-suited guards exhaled cigarette smoke. Sophia embraced him from behind, her voice suddenly saccharine.

"Join me." She licked blood from his neck. "I know Victoria's safe combination..."
###Chapter 21

"I know exactly where Victoria is." Sophia Reynolds traced Lucas Whitmore's haggard face with her fingertips. "Once we kidnap her and get the ransom, we can disappear together."

Beads of sweat formed on Lucas's temple. Sophia dabbed them away with a silk handkerchief. "Look at you. You've suffered so much."

"It's all Victoria's fault!" Lucas clenched his fists. "Why does she get to live freely while I'm like this?"

He shut his eyes in agony. Yes, his downfall was entirely Victoria Montgomery's doing.

...

In the café, Sophia slid a memory card across the table toward Victoria.

"Where's the recording?" Victoria demanded coldly.

Sophia pressed down on Victoria's reaching hand. "Such private content shouldn't be viewed here, Ms. Montgomery. Don’t you think a more discreet location would be appropriate?"

"You think you deserve to ride in my car?" Victoria yanked her hand back in disgust.

"Oh, I wouldn’t dare." Sophia smiled cryptically. "I just hope you’ll transfer the payment promptly after verifying the goods."

Victoria stood and strode toward the parking lot. A shadowy figure lunged at her from the darkness. Before she could react, a sharp blow struck the back of her head.

When she came to, a rag was stuffed in her mouth. The hushed voices of her captors reached her ears.

"We can’t contact the Montgomerys!" Lucas's voice trembled. "They’ll trace us."

"Then who?" Sophia kicked a metal barrel impatiently. "Who else cares if she lives or dies?"

Lucas suddenly lowered his voice. "Ethan Sinclair... I heard he hooked up with a wealthy woman in France..."

Victoria's pulse spiked. Ethan... Would he still come for her?

When the call connected, Ethan's silence thickened the air in the garage.

"No ransom, and she dies!" Lucas shrieked hysterically.

A soft chuckle came through the receiver. Victoria's blood turned to ice.

"She means nothing to me." Ethan's voice was terrifyingly calm. "And just so you know, kidnapping is a felony."

Nothing.

The word stabbed through her heart like a blade. Victoria finally understood—she had lost the man who once loved her deeply.

As the dial tone buzzed in the silence, Sophia approached with a pair of scissors. "Since you're awake, it's time we settled our score..."

Ethan set down his phone, his knuckles white.

He had sworn to cut all ties with Victoria. But a life was at stake, and if the police got involved...

After a moment’s hesitation, he dialed Mr. Montgomery’s private number.
The Parisian wind still cut like knives, but Ethan Sinclair's palms remained warm.

The first significant day after his rebirth was when he donated blood to Lucas Whitmore.

A month later, the "Apple Tree" jewelry collection, a collaboration between Santa and Ethan's studio, took the world by storm.

At the press conference, a reporter sharply accused Ethan of plagiarism in his early works. Under the glare of camera flashes, he calmly explained the inspiration behind each piece.

The scandal had long since died down back home. Ethan knew it was Isabella Laurent who had quietly orchestrated everything.

Lucas had plagiarized countless designers. With the Montgomery Group's backing, victims had no choice but to swallow their anger. Only when Santa publicly accused Lucas did those suppressed voices finally erupt.

The Montgomery Group's stock plummeted, and former allies turned their backs overnight. Yet Victoria Montgomery and Lucas vanished without a trace.

When Victoria's father arrived at the abandoned factory, he found chaos. Victoria lay bleeding on the ground, while Lucas trembled nearby.

No one knew the details of the struggle. Only that Sophia Reynolds had tried to blind Victoria with scissors but ended up cutting the rope binding her in the scuffle.

When Victoria seized the scissors to fight back, Lucas struck the fatal blow from behind.

In the end, Sophia bled to death, Victoria fell into a coma with severe injuries, and Lucas was imprisoned.

But none of that mattered to Ethan anymore.

He stood by the Seine, watching Isabella beside him. Sunlight broke through the clouds, gilding her hair with gold.

This time, he would take her hand and walk slowly through the rest of their lives.
