
###Chapter 1 Let's Get A Divorce




In a dimly lit bedroom at Crest Villa, Crobert.


After their intimate encounter, Brandon Watson brushed his lips against the small mole on Millie Bennett's chest softly, and then sat up.


He said in a detached voice, "Let's get a divorce."


Millie, still breathing hard from the encounter, turned to him slowly, a wild look of disbelief in her eyes.


They had been married for a year. What did he mean by suddenly saying he wanted a divorce?


"She has stomach cancer and has only six months left to live," Brandon said, lighting a cigarette.


The smoke rose in slow spirals around his face.



"Her final wish is to be my wife," he added, almost offhandedly.
Millie gawked at him, stunned. Silence spread across the room like mist.



The bedside lamp glowed faintly, casting long shadows across the wall, making them seem farther apart than they were.


Brandon glanced at her and gave a faint frown.


"It's only to comfort her," he explained. "We'll.remarry after six months. She won't be here long,Millie."



His voice was steady, almost detached, like someone passing along a message that didIn't concern him.


Millie watched Brandon wordlessly, her eyes fixed on his profile.


He spoke like his words were instructions, not suggestions.


Their relationship had always been one-sided. She had chased it from the start, drawn in by youthful affection.She had stayed by his side for years, moving through each rough season without letting go.


Millie still remembered that day, under the heavy rain that soaked them both, Brandon had stood between her and her stepfather, gripping a cracked stick,and said with fire in his voice, "Touch Millie again, and you'll regret it."


That moment had etched itself into her heart.Even when she was weak and bleeding, she saw him-unmoving, protective,fierce.


From that point on, she was his.


She loved him without pause, met his requests with everything she had, carrying them out more flawlessly than anyone else ever could.



He would always pat her head, light and warm, and say in a low voice, "You did so well, Millie."


But Brandon's praises never lasted, his kisses barely stayed, and whatever affection they shared always felt just out of reach. But Millie told herself it was justhow he was.



Even when others called her naive, she stayed-devoted and trusting.


She had given seven years of her life to him.


A year earlier, Brandon's grandfather, Derek Watson,had fallen into poor health. The family, hoping to lift his spirits, decided Brandon should marry. Perhaps the joy of a wedding would give the old man something to hold on to.


So Brandon went on to marry Millie.


She thought it was finally their moment. But after the vows, something changed. He began to pull away.Sometimes, he looked at her like she was a stranger.


"Millie, are you listening?" Brandon scowled as he caught the far-off look in Millie's eyes.


"Does it have to be like this?" she asked softly.


He didn't answer. Instead, he said, "She's going through so much, Millie.
"Millie's chest tightened. "And what about me?"


Brandon didn't answer right away. His eyes, dark and steady, flickered with a trace of impatience.


Then, after about three seconds, he said, "MAillie,she's dying. Maybe you don't know, but she's in love with me. Because we were married, and she didn't want to hurt you, she never let things go too far between us. Even when I tried to make it up to her,she never let me. She's a good person. Please, let her have this. Don't make me think you're being heartless."


His words, spoken so calmly, pierced her more than if he had shouted.



So in Brandon's eyes, a woman in love with a married man, who promised to hold back but never really let go, was a saint.


And a wife who simply wanted to keep her husband to herself was heartless.



Millie stared at his face. The same face she had fallenfor-intense eyes, prominent nose, beautiful lips.


When had things started to crumble?


Maybe it was the day the woman showed up.


"Are you sure this is wwhat you want?" Millie asked,steadying herself.


Brandon said nothing, pursing his lips.


Finally, he opened his mouth to respond. "Yes, you-""Alright." Millie cut him off before he could finish.


Brandon looked up, clearly surprised. He frowned,studying her closely.


"Millie, you're getting clever," he said, a flicker of irritation in his voice. "You know I need your consent to go through with it. Are you thinking of using it to get under my skin?"


Millie didn't answer. She just stared at the white wall,watching how their shadows stretched.


Brandon put out his cigarette and said no more,pulling on his clothes quickly and storming out.


He didn't stop to consider how she felt. Nor did he pause to acknowledge how humiliating or painful his request was.


He knew she couldn't leave him.


He was utterly sure about that.


The door slammed shut behind him.


And just like that, Millie was alone.


She sat motionless by the bed, staring at the door as if it might open again.


Her phone buzzed beside her.


A message lit up the screen.


She picked up the phone.


It was from a familiar number. "He came to see me again."


The text came with a photo. Brandon's face was captured in the reflection of a glass door, a soft smileplaying on his lips, eyes warm in a way Millie had never seen.



She froze. Then, slowly, she scrolled upward through the previous messages. "He said he has feelings for me."



"Rainy nights aren't lonely for me because he's here with me.What about you?"


"The one who isn't loved is truly the other woman.Millie, you were never his first choice; you were just the one he settled for. He sees beauty the way I do,shares my taste in things, and he loves me."


The messages continued that way, proving Brandon's betrayal.


The man who had always treated her with distance these past seven years had apparently mastered tenderness for someone else.


Millie kept scrolling until she reached the very first message. "You should know who l am. Do you like the flowers in your living room today? I sent them. Hesaid they were beautiful."


Of course, Millie knew who it was.


Vivian Simpson, the famous floral designer known for filling her wealthy clients' grand villas and lavish parties with carefully and beautifully arranged blooms.



Millie had shown Brandon the messages before.He'd brushed them off and said there was no proof they were from Vivian.



He had even said maybe Millie sent them herself just to stir trouble. Most of the messages didn't have pictures, and the few that did were vague-taken from afar, hard to pin down.


But not today's. Today's was clear.


Millie thought about showing him the photo. Then her eyes drifted toward the bedside drawer. She reached down and pulled it open.


There it was. The pregnancy test result she'd gotten earlier that day.
She was pregnant with Brandon's child. At the worst possible moment.


Her tears fell, soaking the paper and smudging the ink.


But what did it matter anymore? Brandon's heart had been gone for a long time.


Millie wiped her face dry and picked up the lighter he'd left behind. Flames flickered as she held the test result to the fire.



Brandon had no idea that saying yes to the divorce would be the final thing she'd ever do for him.


She had given him back what she owed-not in money, but in seven full years of her life.


She would never love him again.

###Chapter 2 Terminate The Pregnancy




The next day, parked just outside the courthouse,Brandon sat in his Maybach, quietly tapping the steering wheel with his left hand.


"Brandon, you and Millie have been married for a year now. Don't you think it's time to start planning for a baby?" An elderly voice drifted from the phone's speaker.


Brandon's face softened, a trace of frustration flickering through, but his patience didn't waver.


"Grandma, we're still young. There's no need to rush.You and Grandpa should focus on staying healthy.He..."


"What do you mean by 'There's no need to rush'?"The elderly voice rose in annoyance. "Your.grandfather's condition might have improved,but we're not getting any younger. We don't know how much time we've got left.""Grandma..."


"Don't give me that! I've heard things, Brandon.Whatever's going on, be good to Millie."


Silence fell over the line for a few seconds.


"Brandon, did you hear me?" the elder asked.


Brandon rubbed his forehead in frustration. "|understand, Grandma."


They exchanged a few more words before he ended the call.


Brandon resumed tapping the steering wheel with his fingers, this time slower, more distracted. He stared through the windshield toward the courthouse.


He clenched his jaw. Then, he opened the messaging app on his phone.


His thumb hovered over a familiar profile picture-a simple floral image, tagged "My Love." He skipped past it and opened the thread with Millie.


The last message he'd sent her simply reminded herof the time and place to meet for the divorce.


She still hadn't shown up.


With a scowl, Brandon sent a new message. "Where are you?"


A knock on the window followed almost instantly. He turned to see Millie standing outside, her face a little pale.



She opened the door and slipped into the passenger seat,giving him a blank look.


He hadn't changed out of yesterday's clothes-the same ones she had picked out for him.


Through the years, it had always been her-choosing his ties, picking his cologne, arranging every detail down to the fit of his tailored shirts and suits.



"Why are you late?" Brandon asked.


Millie looked away.


"I'm not late," she said quietly.She was simply no longer the girl who would always arrive early and wait for him without thinking.


Brandon's fingers stilled against the wheel. His eyes narrowed slightly as he studied her.


Millie looked a little pale, maybe from a sleepless night after he mentioned the divorce last night.


Still, she looked fine.


"My grandma called earlier," Brandon muttered,looking away. "Don't tell them about the divorce.They're too old to handle something like that."


Millie didn't respond right away. Instead, she asked,"What did your grandma say?"


"She wants us to have a baby," Brandon said flatly, a flicker of irritation slipping into his voice.


Silence settled in the car.


After a while, Millie let out a small soft laugh.


Brandon curled his hand into a fist and turned his face to the window.There were moments when he used to imagine what their child might look like.


He remembered holding her fromn behind, pressing a hand gently over her belly, whispering, "Millie, when will you give me a baby?"


But it hadn't happened.


Anyway, they could always remarry in six months and start planning for a baby. There would still be enough time.


Vivian, however, only had six months left.


Outside, passers-by came and went.


Then Millie spoke up. "Just once more, Brandon.Are you completely sure you want to go through with the divorce?"


"Having second thoughts?" Brandon barked, looking genuinely upset.


Vivian was still waiting for him at the studio.


After confirming once more, Millie didn't say another
word. She reached into her bag, pulled out a document, and handed it to Brandon.


He took it with a frown, flipping through the pages.It was a property division agreement.


"If we're getting divorced," she said, "we should make everything clear. I'll only take what I'm entitled to from the Watson family. And from this moment on,anything either of us earns belongs to us individually."


Then Millie pulled out a pen and placed it beside him.


"If that's okay with you, just sign it."


Brandon's eyes stayed on the document, but his frown deepened as he read.


The agreement was too simple. She really wasn't asking for much. And her signature was already there.



He didn't get it.


What was she trying to do? It was basically just afake divorce.


Vivian only had six months left. He planned to spend those months by her side. After that, he'd return to Millie-no one else needed to know the divorce ever happened.


To him, Millie had always seemed blindly loyal.


Brandon had never thought of her as someone with pride or boundaries.


There was a time he'd grown bored of her, pushing her into things that chipped away at her pride on purpose.


But Millie never declined.


She'd still return with a soft smile, holding out the results like a trophy. "Brandon, look-I did it. Isn't it great?"


She was a good wife. Meek. Obedient. For seven years, he'd seen it play out over and over.


If it weren't for Vivian, their marriage probably wouldhave gone on like that.



But...



A flash of memory-Vivian, weak and coughing blood, still trying to smile-stabbed at his chest. The pain was raw and unshakable.



Brandon looked outside the car window again.



Millie's reflection stared back at him-blank,expressionless.



Was this her way of threatening him?


After all, she had once faked messages to frame Vivian.



She hated Vivian.


Chuckling dryly, Brandon picked up the pen and signed his name.


No one could force his hand. Not even her.



There were two copies of the agreement.Millie calmly took her copy after he signed both.


They both stepped out of the car and headed into the courthouse. Together, they filed for divorce.


Next time they came back here, they would finalize everything and collect the official decree.


Once all the formalities were done, the two of them stepped out of the courthouse together.


The sun was already blazing, and the warmth settled on Millie's skin.



Brandon scanned the people moving about.


It wasn't hard to tell the couples getting married from those getting divorced. Some people chose to have their weddings at the courthouse.


A couple walked by, hand in hand.


The woman's smile triggered something in Brandon.He remembered that same look on Millie's face a year ago, when they first got married.


Brandon glanced over at Millie, but her face was
blank.


"I'll keep transferring money to your account during the next six months," he said. "And don't say anything to my grandparents."


He didn't wait for a reply. Just turned and walked off.


Millie stood there quietly, watching his car disappear around the corner.



Her cab arrived not long after.


And then, the two cars went opposite directions.


One turned toward Vivian Floral Design.


The other headed for Crobert Hospital.


Brandon walked into Vivian's studio, where she greeted him with a gentle smile.


He told her, "It's done. She didn't make a scene."


Meanwhile, Millie stepped into the ob-gyn wing and quietly sat opposite the doctor.


The doctor reached over and pulled the curtain."Millie... are you sure you want to terminate the pregnancy?" Her best friend and doctor, Alexia Hussain, looked at her with concern. "You were so determined to have a baby. You even worked so hard to get yourself ready for conception..."


Millie reached into her bag and placed the divorce filing receipt on the side table.


"Yes," she replied calmly. "Let's terminate it. I don't、want it anymore."
###Chapter 3 Signs Of Miscarriage




Alexia stared at the filing receipt, surprised.


She and Millie had been close friends for more than ten years, and in all that time, Alexia had seen just how hard Millie loved Brandon.



There was a time Millie could have died for him, and nobody would have questioned it.


They got married a year ago. Alexia had smiled at the wedding, even though something about their pairing felt off. But still, Millie had gotten what she wanted.That had been enough for Alexia.


Now this...


What had happened?


"I don't love him anymore," Millie said, before Alexia could ask.


She looked over and gave a small, calm smile.In that smile, Alexia caught a glimpse of the old Millie -the one from before everything collapsed, before grief carved deep lines into her, before her father's death and the fall of the Bennett family changed her.


It brought Alexia a strange sense of calm.


"Brandon doesn't know I'm pregnant," Millie said calmly. "And before the divorce becomes final, I don't want to take any risks. It's better if he doesn't know.".


If either party changed their mind before the divorce was finalized, they could take back the application,and the procedure would no longer go through.


And that was when Alexia knew that Millie wasn't playing around about divorcing Brandon.


After taking it all in, Alexia did what needed to be done: she booked Millie's medical tests and then advised carefully, "Wait a few days before the surgery."


Millie frowned in confusion."Why?"


"You know your blood type-Rh-negative. It's rare.We need time to prepare blood, just in case. I've already contacted the blood bank. They said it might take a week."


Millie went quiet. The sadness in her eyes was unmistakable.


She had gotten that blood type from her father. And now she missed him all over again.


If he were still here...


"Okay." Millie nodded slowly. A smile tugged at her lips, but her eyes turned red.


"You also have early signs of miscarriage. You need to be careful these next few days," Alexia added,her voice full of concern.


They'd grown up together, and Alexia knew Millie's sadness too well.



She held Millie's hand. "Wait for me. My shift's almost over. I'll go home with you."


Millie nodded, and then went to wait in the hallway.She looked down at her stomach.


Early signs of miscarriage.


Did the baby know what she'd decided and want to leave first?


Pursing her lips, Millie walked toward the lab for the tests.



Her phone buzzed. It was a bank notification.


She had opened a new account-one that Brandon wouldn't know about. She was keeping her money cleanly separate before the divorce was finalized.


Every cent she earned from now on would live in that account.


A second message followed. "Payment for composition and lyrics has been completed.Finance has sent the transfer. Kindly confirm."


Before she married Brandon, Millie had worked quietly as an anonymous songwriter.


Music had always been her first love. Back when herfather was alive, life had been generous, and she lacked nothing. As the Bennett family's only daughter, she had the freedom and the means to grow her gift.


The turns her life had taken had taught her things she hadn't known she needed to learn.



Maybe her father never thought that the pastime he once encouraged would one day be the very thing.keeping her afloat.


Millie paused, and then typed back, "Money received. Thank you."


The reply came quickly. "It's what you deserve.You've written a lotof hits over the years. Why don't you return? There's a new show coming up. It fits you perfectly. I've sent details to your email. Reserved a contestant slot just for you."


Millie opened her email. A new message sat at the top, inviting her to join a music competition show.The format was familiar, like others she had seen before, but this one wanted something original.
She typed out a quick reply. "I'll think about it."


Then she set her phone down. A light cramp curled in her lower belly.


She thought of her father again.


The second time today.







Meanwhile,the Internet was buzzing with updates.


#VivianSimpsonStomachCancer


#FloristVivianSimpsonCountdown


#LastSixMonths



The most trending post was a video featuring a reporter summarizing the news about Vivian."Sources confirm that the well-known floral designer,Vivian Simpson, has been diagnosed with stomach cancer. She's been given six months to live. But instead of retreating, she's choosing to document her remaining time-she wants to share her life with the world as it winds down."The video cut to Vivian. She looked at the camera with a sad smile. "In these last six months, I'll be posting updates about my life. I'm not doing it for attention. I just want to offer some comfort to others going through the same thing. I hope you all stay strong."


Then the reporter came back on screen. "There have long been whispers about Miss Simpson and Mr.Brandon Watson, CEO of Watson Group. But Mr.Watson is married. It remains to be seen if he'll reconnect with Miss Simpson during her final months."



In the background, Vivian seemed to have heard that part. She stepped forward, stopped beside the reporter, and gently cut in.


She faced the camera.



"I'm not ashamed to say I like Brandon. He's an incredible man," shesaid. "I'm sure I'm not the only.one who feels that way. But I want to make it clear-I'm not going to break up someone's marriage.That's not who l am."
Having said that, she walked off, leaving the reporter behind.


She wove through the small crowd with a smile and climbed into a waiting car.


The foreign caregiver from Flaville passed her a glass of water, hand paused in midair, unsure.



"You look like you want to say something," Vivian.said, her voice cold. "Go ahead. The driver's one of ours."



The caregiver leaned in and lowered their voice."Miss Simpson, your diagnosis... it's a stomach ulcer.Having our facility change that into cancer is already risky. But now you're sharing it with the public online?"


Vivian gave a sharp laugh, startling the caregiver.


"Your facility-is it a licensed medical facility?" she asked.



The caregiver nodded."And does it manage my medical record privately?"


The caregiver gave another nod.


"Is that what my medical record says-that I have six months left because of terminal stomach cancer?"



The caregiver hesitated before nodding again.


"Exactly!" Vivian leaned back with a smile. "It's official, then. No one can question it."


"But you don't actually have stomach cancer. What happens later..."


"There are two ways out," Vivian said, cutting in. Her voice was sharper now, her eyes harder. "One: I make a miraculous recovery during treatment at your facility or somewhere else, maybe because of all the love l've received. Two: your facility gets blamed for a diagnostic error and months of wrong treatment."


She turned her face fully to the caregiver, looking more intimidating. "Which option do you prefer?"


The caregiver looked panicked but forced out theat most words. "I'm sorry, Miss Simpson. I understand.You've already thought everything through."


Vivian gave a short, cold smile.


"Where should we go next, Miss Simpson?" the caregiver asked in an attempt to lighten the mood.


Vivian glanced at her phone. "Crobert Hospital."


The caregiver stiffened."But-"


"Relax. I'm only going in for pain relief with my medical record," Vivian said, and then reached for her phone and sent Brandon a message, telling him to meet her at the hospital later.


Almost instantly, he replied, "Sure."


Meanwhile, Millie stood in the hospital restroom, a steady ache pulling at her lower stomach. In her hand was a tissue, the smear of blood clear against the white.



It was an early sign of a miscarriage.

###Chapter 4 She Would Have No Ties

With Brandon





As Vivian made her way to Crobert Hospital, the Internet was filled with comments about her diagnosis. Her name appeared across countless threads.



"To be honest, I think Vivian's brave. She's clear about her feelings as well as boundaries. Quite impressive, actually."


"Exactly. A lot of people like Brandon. As long as she's not wrecking his marriage, her feelings are her own business."



"Her older videos and that livestream from Crest Villa gave me a glimpse into rich people's lives. It's sad she won't be around much longer."



"Who's Brandon's wife, though? Sheshould just let him be with Vivian. The girl has only six months left."
I know her. It's Millie Bennett, a musician. She stopped working after she got married and became a full-time housewife."







At Crobert Hospital, Millie's phone kept buzzing.Calls and messages came one after another. Some people acted concerned. Others wanted information.A few tried to mock her. All of it was about Vivian and Brandon.



Millie had read just enough of the headlines to understand what was going on with Vivian's illness.


She didn't click on anything else."Any pain?" She saw the strain on Millie's face and,without needing to be asked, reached out to help her rise.


Millie gave a small smile and shook her head.


She had made up her mind. Some things simply had to be faced.



Alexia understood, but she just sighed and helped.Millie up. They took the elevator.


The elevator doors soon opened at the ground floor.


The hospital was packed. Even more than usual.Millie noticed a few reporters scattered in the crowd.


"So many people today. Probably another celebrity here for a check-up," Alexia said. "They always bring this kind of attention..." She stopped at once, her face changing. She had seen something and quickly tried to lead Millie in the other direction.



But there was no point. Millie had already spotted them.


It didn't matter anymore.


Once the divorce was finalized, Brandon would no longer be a part of her life.


She checked the time. When she looked up, she saw Alexia walking toward her.


"How are you feeling?" Alexia asked, concerned.
Brandon stood tall, striking in a way that drew attention without effort. The noise and movement around him didn't touch him-his hair perfectly in place, his suit smooth and sharp, like the chaos didn't dare come close.


Vivian stood beside him. She looked small and weak,her face pale, which made her seem even more fragile.


She lost her balance slightly. Brandon stepped in to catch her, shielding her from the cameras and the crowd.


"Don't look," Alexia said quickly, stepping in front of Millie, her tone sharp with anger.


"Alexia, let's go," Millie said, her voice calm. She had made up her mind; Brandon didn't need to know she was there, and she had no interest in crossing paths with him now.



"Why should we go?" Alexia snapped, growing more furious. "You're not divorced yet. He's still your husband. And he's here holding another woman like
it's nothing.It's shameless."


Husband...


Millie looked away, sighing.


There was a time she had secretly smiled just thinking about Brandon being her husband.


But not anymore.


"I don't feel well, Alexia. Let's just go," Millie said,changing the topic.


Alexia gave her full attention now and stopped looking in Brandon and Vivian's direction.


They left. Across the lobby, Vivian glanced over. A flicker of pride passed through her face.


"I'm sorry, Brandon. I didn't mean to drag you into this mess," she said, a tinge of remorse in her voice."I know you hate being in the spotlight..."


"It's fine," Brandon replied. "Let's go see the doctor first." His face stayed calm, but something stirred in his thoughts-something brief, hard to name.They stepped into the consultation room.


Vivian handed over her medical record to the doctor.


The doctor read through it, slowly,and frowned.


"This looks serious," he said.



Vivian gave a faint smile. "I know," she said quietly.Then she took a slow breath. "Please prescribe something strong for the pain."


"In your current condition, I suggest you stay in the hospital and begin treatment," the doctor said. "You should try. There's still a chance we can extend your life."



"What's the point?" Vivian gave a sad smile.


She brushed away the tears building in her eyes, and then said quietly, "I don't want treatment."


Brandon's fingers curled tighter around hers.


She gave a small shake of her head.


"Doctor, I just want to spend the last phase of my lifewith some dignity," she said. "So, please prescribe some strong painkillers."


The doctor sighed deeply but finally nodded in understanding.


Outside, reporters were taking photos and recording videos without pause before posting them online.


People watching were emotional.


"Good heavens, this is a real person whose life is ending."


"I cry when I'm in mild pain. I can't imagine what late-stage cancer feels like. But she still manages to smile. She's really strong."


"I couldn't hold back tears when she said she wouldn't go through treatment. Only people who've faced serious illness understand this feeling."


Public sympathy for Vivian reached its highest point.






Vivian soon got her medicine, and as she andBrandon walked out of the hospital, Millie was sitting on a bench nearby. She was waiting for Alexia, who had gone to get the car.



Before Millie could respond to what wNas happening,paparazzi noticed her and rushed over.


The camera flashes came all at once.


Brandon saw her too. He frowned and asked, "What are you doing here?"



Millie stood up, glanced at Brandon, and then at Vivian's hand resting on his arm.


She didn't speak yet. The crowd didn't give her the chance.



"Mrs. Watson, did you come because of what's online? Are you trying to catch them together?"


"What do you think of your husband being out in public with someone else?"


"Mrs. Watson, what are you planning to do about Vivian?"People quickly decided that Millie had shown up on purpose-to face Vivian directly, to start something.


Even Brandon thought the same.


He looked annoyed.


"Vivian is sick. Didn't you know?" he barked.


Brandon's voice was brimming with menace.


Millie felt like laughing.


So that was what he believed-that she was picking a fight on purpose with someone who was ill.


Brandon really didn't know her.


Seeing Millie didn't answer, the reporters turned to Vivian, asking questions about breaking up someone's marriage.


Brandon looked at Millie again. "Millie!" he called.He wanted her to defend Vivian.


Like always, he expected her to do what he wanted.


But the will to please him was gone.She was walking away from him-there was no reason left to obey.


Millie placed her right hand over her stomach. The dull ache was still there.


"I came to visit a friend," she said finally.


She didn't want to say more. Her pregnancy wasn't something she wanted to share-not before the divorce was finalized, not with all eyes on her.


Her reply to his question earlier was simple.


Having answered Brandon, Millie turned to leave.


But the reporters didn't back off. They crowded in around her.


"Mrs. Watson, people online are asking you to step aside and let Mr. Watson be with Vivian. What do you say to that?"


"Vivian doesn't have long. Are you still going to fight her?"


"Mrs.Watson-"Millie didn't bother responding; she just wanted to get away.


The crowd, thrilled to see the three of them in the same place at last, had no intention of letting it end.


Brandon stood still, saying nothing, and that silence gave someone the boldness to shove Millie with force.


She staggered, her arms moving at once to shield her stomach.
###Chapter 5 To Let Go Of The Past





Millie landed hard, her back hitting the ground first.


Cameras flashed wildly, capturing the fall from every angle.


She looked toward Brandon by instinct. But his face.gave nothing-just a cold, still stare.


And in that moment, she understood what he wanted her to do, and it stung her heart.


He wanted her to speak for him. To tell the press it was all a misunderstanding. That Vivian was ill,and he had only come out of concern. That it was kindness, no betrayal.


Clutching her belly, Millie lowered her head and let a faint smile slip across her face.


The sky above was clear, and sunlight streamed through gaps in the crowd. But none of it touchedher.


She steadied herself and rose slowly.


Then, without looking back, she said calmly, "I feel sorry for Miss Simpson. But that's all."


Someone nearby, unaware, asked, "So, are you friends with her?"


Millie gave a short laugh. "Friends? No. I wouldn't call someone clinging to mny husband a friend."


She turned and waved to Alexia, who had just pulled up.


"Millie!" Brandon called after her, his face red with rage.


But she didn't turn around. She stood tall and kept walking.


Alexia got out and moved quickly toward her friend,scoffing as they left, "You'd think they were the married couple confronting the home-wrecker.Absolutely ridiculous."Vivian's lips parted to respond. "You..."


But Alexia cut in before she could say a word."What?Tell me I'm wrong. If you're planning to use the press to scare me, go ahead. I've ggot nothing to hide."


Vivian's face turned even paler, looking as if she might faint.


Reporters scrambled, voices rising all at once.


Alexia ushered Millie into the car, not sparing another glance behind them.


"Don't worry," she said. "She's definitely faking it.I've seen enough of these cases to tell in a second."


Millie gave her a small smile. "I'm not worried about her. I'm worried about you. What if this mess affects your job?"


At a red light, Alexia grinned and nudged her. "Don't forget my dad's the hospital director."


Millie raised an eyebrow. "The same dad you swore you'd never speak to again?"Alexia shrugged. "You never know when a connection comes in handy. Honestly, sometimes I wish all the powerful people out there were my dads."



They both laughed, the tension slowly easing from Millie's face. As the light turned green, the car moved forward again.



"I've got the afternoon free," Alexia said, stretching."Whatever you need, I'm ready."


Playing along, Millie turned to her with a sly grin."Great. I need help with something."


"What is it?" Alexia asked curiously.


"Help me move." She grabbed Alexia's wrist. "You can't back out now."



Alexia groaned but gave in.


Before long, the two of them arrived at the house Millie had shared with Brandon, along with a team of movers and organizers.The house had come together quickly after their rushed wedding.


Everything-furniture and layout-had felt temporary at first. But over the year, Millie had made a home out of it, filling it with warmth.


At least, she tried.


Alexia directed the workers while Millie moved quietly around the room, her hands light on every object. On a shelf, she spotted a bottle of Chanel No.5.


The first gift Brandon ever gave her. He'd brought it back from a business trip.


He came straight to her from the airport.


He had pulled her into his arms. His kisses were quick, urgent. They had been just like any young couple in love back then.


She opened the bottle and sprayed it once. The scent filled the room.



She remembered how he had kissed her lightly afterspraying it on her skin.


"Should I pack this too?" Alexia asked, seeing the perfume.


Millie glanced over and shook her head. "Leave it."


She slipped off the wedding ring Brandon had picked without thought, placing it gently on the table.


But as the movers shuffled back and forth through.the space, she paused. Then, quietly, she opened a drawer and put both the perfume and the ring inside.


Soon, the house had been cleared of every trace of her. Only that bottle andd that ring remained.


Packing up had been tiring, but once the decision was made, it moved quickly.


It was the same with her feelings.


The wind moved softly through her hair as the car headed toward her new place. Behind her, the mansion faded in the rearview mirror.


Sometimes, to move forward, one had to leave partsof oneself behind.


Millie had things to do.


The fall of the Bennett family, the unanswered questions around her father's sudden death-she was going to find the truth.


Her life had always been shaped by what others needed.


Now it was time to live for herself.


She decided to begin with the music show. It would bring in money, and more importantly, might reconnect her with people linked to her father's past.


She pulled out her phone, found the right contact,and typed her message. "I'm joining the music program."






Vivian was still crying.


Brandon sat beside her, muttering words of comfort.

But his thoughts were filled with the image of Milliestanding with her back to him, saying those words.


She had known exactly what he wanted her to say.And she had chosen not to.



He had sent her message after message. She hadn't replied any of them.


She had been acting strangely lately.


The change in her was too sharp, too sudden. She was provoking him on purpose.


She had done it when they filed for divorce. And again at the hospital.


Brandon remembered the look in her eyes the night before, when she asked if he truly made up his mind about the divorce.



She had been sad but also calm.


An unexpected fear filled his heart.


"Brandon, don't be angry at Millie," Vivian said through tears. "I know she's upset. After seeing the videos online, she must've come to confront us. AndI understand."


She burst into tears. "After all... I'm the one who took something from her. I'm taking six months from your marriage-what's left of it. If she lashes out at mne,I deserve it..."



As she spoke, she started coughing-hard.


A second later, she spat blood into her hand.


"Vivian!" Brandon jumped up, reaching for his phone to call for an ambulance.


As for Millie's sudden change, he brushed it off as moodiness. In his mind, she wouldn't dare walk away.


Vivian reached out and stopped him, still smiling faintly. "It's the cancer. It's late-stage. This happens.Don't worry."


Her caregiver helped her lie back down.


Brandon turned away, already thinking of confronting Millie. As soon as he left the room, Vivian calmly wiped her mouth and pulled out a small blood baghidden in her cheek.


She laughed. "What do you think he'll say to Millie now?" she asked the caregiver. "I'm honestly looking forward to it."



Then she began to go through the news reports excitedly.


The entire online community seemed against Millie.


"Vivian didn't even go for life-saving treatment-she just wanted pain meds. Millie really made a scene for no reason."


"Vivian's dying, and Millie still wants to pick fights?"


"Mr. Watson and Vivian look perfect together. Like a real power couple."


"Millie's fall was so embarrassing. I cringed."


"Millie, just step aside already!"


"Millie, divorce Brandon!"


"Yeah,divorce Brandon!""Divorce!"


Vivian chuckled as she read the comments. Then she sent a message to a contact and gave a few instructions. "Today's move was perfect. Keep the pressure up. Make sure Millie stays where she is-down. Oh, and find out why she went to the hospital today."
###Chapter 6 I'm Busy





As Brandon drove home, his phone kept buzzing nonstop.


When he glanced at the screen and saw the caller ID,he felt a headache already forming.


He finally picked up on the last ring.


"Grandma," he said, trying to sound calm.


"So you still remember you have a grandmother!"Norma Watson, Brandon's grandmother, barked from the other end of the phone. "What exactly is going on with that Vivian woman?"



Brandon pressed a palm against his temple."Vivian is sick. She's not trying to cause trouble."


"She is not trying to cause trouble?" Norma snapped."Can you hear yourself? She knows you're married and still hangs around you, playing the victim andacting like some noble mistress. I've never seen anyone so bold and shameless. You need to end this mess and go apologize to Millie immediately."


Brandon's jaw tightened. Millie's face crossed his mind, and something uncomfortable stirred in his chest.


"Did Millie tell you anything?" he asked, his voice hardening.


"Does she even have to?" Norma fired back. "The entire Internet is talking about it! Brandon, Millie is your wife. You watched someone shove her to the ground while you stood there with another woman!You're embarrassing her in front of the whole world with those reporters watching!"


Brandon remembered that moment. Millie's face, the way she looked at him-hurt. Maybe he did make a mistake.



Still, he pushed the thought aside.


"She saw the news and went to the hospital to makea scene. She did it on purpose, Grandma," he said.


"Let me speak to him," Derek Watson, Brandon's grandfather, said, taking the phone.


"Brandon," Derek said firmly, "you're the one who brought Millie home. You said you wanted to marry her. Now that you have, it's your duty to stand by her."



"Grandpa..." Brandon began.


"Come home for dinner tonight," Derek said, cutting him off. "Bring Millie with you."


He didn't wait for a reply before hanging up.


Brandon sat there for a moment, his fingers tapping the steering wheel, a frown on his face.


He opened his contacts and scrolled until he found Millie's name.


She stilI hadn't replied to the messages he'd sent earlier.


Frustrated, he hit the call button.It rang for a while before she finally picked up.


"Are you busy?" Brandon asked coldly.


"Why are you calling?" Millie replied.


Brandon ran a hand over his face. "Why did you go to the hospital today? Was it just to pick a fight with Vivian?"


"No," she said simply. "I went to see Alexia."


"Millie, don't lie to me," he snapped. The irritation in his voice returned quickly.


But on the other end, there was only a quiet laugh-short, light, and far too calm.


It got under Brandon's skin.


Still, his grandfather's words echoed in his head. He had no choice.



"Come with me to visit my grandparents tonight," he finally said.


"I'm busy," Millie replied, her voice firm and final."It's my grandpa's order," Brandon said.


Millie didn't answer; she hung up.


All that remained was the dial tone.


Brandon stared at the screen, looking quite stunned.


He called again, but she didn't pick up.


He kept looking at the phone.


Eventually, he set it aside, turned the key in the ignition, and drove home.


The sky outside had started to dim.


When he arrived, he parked the car and walked straight into the house.


The entrance was dark when he stepped inside. His expression was unreadable.


"Millie," Brandon called, his voice low and firm. But there was no answer.



Only then did he realize that the entire house was in darkness.For a moment, Brandon stood still. Every time he came home, there was always at least one light left on.



Most nights, he'd find Millie curled up on the sofa, a book slipping from her hand, the TV low in the background-half asleep while waiting for him.



He switched on the lights and looked over at the couch.



But it was empty.


At first, he had only been upset by Vivian's illness and frustrated by his grandfather's insistence that Millie show up for dinner. But now, the silence around him left him agitated.



He flicked on every light in the house, room by room.


The living room, kitchen, bathroom. But there was no sign of Millie.


She wasn't home. She wasn't answering her phone either.Where on earth was she?



So this was how she wanted to act-throwing a fit over a divorce they both knew was just on paper.



Let her.


She'd get over it. Vivian was temporary. Mllie was his wife, and that wouldn't change.


Still, even if she was refusing to go with him to the Watson family mansion, he couldn't avoid the visit himself.



With that, Brandon walked into the storage room and picked up some health supplements.


He stood there for a moment, and then make a detour to their bedroom.



In their bedroom, the familiar scent of Chanel No.5lingered.


He had bought it for her.



Brandon's shoulders loosened slightly.Grabbing a few changes of clothes, he walked out.


He didn't notice that the wardrobe no longer held both their clothes-only his. Or that the matching items they once shared now sat alone.


The space felt colder than it used to.






Meanwhile, at a beauty salon, Millie and Alexia were'getting their nailsdone.


Millie had asked for pregnancy-safe products, and Alexia shook her head helplessly as she watched.


"You said you'd get rid of it," she said. "But here you are,choosing nail polish made for pregnant women."


Millie smiled. "Why not? It's still part of me for now."


Alexia rolled her eyes and studied her own nails,pleased with how they sparkled.


Millie looked down at hers.


Brandon had a sensitive stomach. Since marryinghim,she'd been cooking for him daily, so she hadn't done her nails in a longtime.


"Whatever," Alexia said. "This is at least a start. Once you're done with your nails, next is your hair,and then your wardrobe. I still remember when we were kids, sneaking around in our moms' heels. There's no need to shrink back into someone you're not."


She held up her hands and smiled. "Too bad I'm a.doctor now. Can't go around looking like a disco ball."



Millie laughed.


This was who she naturally was-bright, expressive,and full of color.


She had only changed for Brandon, having fallen in love with him.


For years, she thought real happiness was simple: to be with the man she loved, cook for him, raise their children, and grow old side by side.


But now, it all seemed ridiculous.Luckily it wasn't too late to change things now.


She was ready to start again-this time on her own terms.

###Chapter 7 New Haircut





After getting their nails done, Millie and Alexia treated themselves to a spa session.


Later, after dropping Alexia off, Millie headed into a hair salon.



The hair dresser gave her long, waist-length hair a thoughtful glance. "You're really cutting it all off? It looks great on you,you know."


It was the kind of hair people paused to admire-thick, sleek, and clearly well looked after.


Millie looked at herself in the mirror.



The smooth fall of her hair framed the skin that was almost translucent. Her soft yellow dress sat gently on her frame, and though she wore no makeup, she still looked stunning, like a lily in full bloom-pure,graceful, and calm.She smiled faintly. "Cut it."


The waist-length hair had always been what Brandon liked. It was never her choice.


"Alright." The hair dresser gave a small nod and got to work.



The sound of the scissors snipping filled the room.Each strand that dropped to the floor felt like shedding the pain and chains of the past years.


When it was done, Millie looked at her reflection and let out a small, almost weightless smile.


"This looks so much better! You look amazing!" the hair dresser said brightly. "If you're open to it, we could add some color or give it a slight perm. It would make it pop even more.Here-take a look."


Millie glanced down at the brochure, but then softly pressed her hand to her belly.


"Not today. It's a bit late already," she said.


The hair dresser seemed disappointed butbrightened again when Millie added, "I'll come back to you for it.Soon."


This one knew his onion.



He beamed. "Deal!" He quickly reached for his schedule."Want to pick a day now?"


MAillie looked down again, thoughtful.


"Maybe in a week. Two at the most. I should be ready'by then."


That was enough time to recover i things went the way she expected.


"Okay, I'll see you soon," the hair dresser said as Millie got up to leave.


Smiling, she gave a small nod.


With her new haircut, she made her way to the downtown area and wandered into the luxury mall.


Designer logos lined the storefronts.


She glanced down at her soft, delicate outfit and letout a quiet, mocking smile.


This sweet and docile style was what Brandon liked.It was a way of showing she was submissive. But it had never truly been her.


She walked through several stores, choosing a few pieces before catching a taxi home.


She stepped into her new house, carrying the bags in one hand.


The space around her was still unfamiliar and empty.She looked around without any clear expression. Not happy. Not sad.


She changed out of the pastel dress and into something bolder-Valentino, sharp in the details.The canvas tote was set aside for a sleek Chanel chain bag.


The wedge sandals came off with one soft kick,replaced by a pair of pointed Dior heels.


Gazing at her reflection, Millie muttered, "Welcome to your new beginning."But the mirror didn't return her smile.



She tried, half-heartedly, to lift the corners of her lips, but it didn't feel real. Not even enough to fool herself.



Seven years.


She could still feel the ache.


And if the smile wouldn't come, she wouldn't force it.


With a long breath, she turned away from the mirror and began to get ready for the next day.


She had made up her mind to start over-and if that was truly what she wanted, she would do it properly.


Tomorrow, she would go to the hospital first. After that, she needed to finalize the music show arrangements.







Morning came faster than expected.


Millie drove to the hospital for her appointment. Shehad already booked everything in advance.


But just before she pulled into the parking lot, her phone buzzed. It was a call from Charles Evans.


He was the CEO of Evans Entertainment, the biggest name in Crobert's music industry and a core part of the Evans empire, which stood on equal ground with the Watson Group.


As the third son of the Evans family, Charles was in charge of the entertainment division.


Millie's songs were released by his company.


After she married Brandon, he had asked her to look after his grandfather, Derek, whose health was beginning to fail. So she immediately stepped out of the spotlight.


Charles, who respected her talent, quietly encouraged her to keep writing songs and releasing them anonymously or under an alias. That way, she could stay connected to the industry without being seen and return whenever she was ready.Millie had agreed to the arrangement and signed a confidentiality agreement with Evans Entertainment.They came up with an alias for her-Eva, and Charles had taken care of everything else himself. Only he knew that Eva was Millie.



At the time, Millie had been too caught up in the joy of being Brandon's wife to think much of it.


Now, she was thankful that Charles had left the door open for her.


She pulled her car to the side of the road and picked up his call.


"Mr. Evans?" she said,surprised.


Their meeting wasn't until later in the afternoon.


"Eva, can you come to the office now?" Charles asked gingerly.


Millie blinked, sensing something was amiss.


Charles rarely called her by that name in private conversations."Is everything fine?" she asked, hesitant to rearrange her schedule. The doctor's appointment was important.



"There's been an offer on your new song," Charles said, pausing for a second. "I'd like to discuss it with you in person."


Millie scowled, puzzled. "You usually handle that.Can't you decide?"



It wasn't like him to bother her with these things. As CEO, he had bigger concerns, and she had always trusted his judgment on routine matters.


"This one's a little... different," Charles said. Then,after a pause, he added, "Vivian Simpson wants to buy it."



Vivian?



Millie froze.



That didn't make sense. Vivian was a floral designer.

What did she need a song for?Before she could ask, Charles continued, "It's quite complicated. I said no at first, but she showed up at the office. She wasn't alone. Brandon came with her.And they both insisted on buying the rights."
###Chapter 8 Another Dying Wish





Brandon had gotten involved too.


"Do they know it's me?" Millie asked, her voice calm but probing.


She didn't explain, but Charles understood. Millie.meant to ask if Vivian knew that "Eva" was actually her.



"No," Charles replied right away. "I'm sure of it."


Millie didn't speak.


Cars rolled by on the road nearby. She stared at the sky as clouds moved lazily across it. Then, with a quiet sigh, she made her choice.


She called the hospital first and pushed her appointment to later in the day. Then she let Charles know she was on her way.


"Come quickly," he said.After ending the call, Millie turned the car around.She stopped to pick up a few things, and then drove straight to Evans Entertainment.


She parked, pulled on a hat, slipped on large dark sunglasses, and covered the rest of her face with a mask.



The elevator chimed as the doors opened.



Wearing her Dior heels, she stepped out and walked into Charles' office.



Charles saw her first. "Eva, you're here."


His eyes lingered briefly on her new look, brows raised, but he said nothing. He just gestured for her to take a seat at the other end of the long table.


Across from her sat Brandon and Vivian.


The moment Millie entered, Vivian rose to her feet.


"Eva, hello, I'm Vivian. You may know me." She smiled softly, her voice weak and her body looking fragile."I truly love your song," she said. "I'm hoping you'll agree to sell it to me."


Millie didn't reply. Her eyes flicked to Brandon.


He didn't look at her. His full attention was on Vivian.


Before Millie could speak, Charles stepped in.


"Miss Simpson, Eva has no plans to sell this particular song. I believe l've already explained that to you,"he said.


Vivian ignored him. Her eyes filled with tears as she turned to Millie.



"But Eva, I love it so much," she said, her face tightening slightly as if from pain.


Brandon shifted beside her, his concern obvious.


Still, Vivian straightened and continued, her eyes on Millie, "I only have six months left. I'm asking you,please-help me fulfill this one last wish."


Millie let out a short laugh.Another dying wish,huh?


When Brandon first asked for a divorce, it was because Vivian'sdying wish was to marry him.


Now, this was another.


Millie didn't take the idea of death lightly. She understood how serious it was. But somehow, she always ended up being the one asked to give something up.


And she couldn't bring herself to honor the wishes of someone who had crossed a line in her marriage.


That Millie wasn't dying didn't mean her feelings didn't matter.


"What if I say no?" she asked, her voice low and rough.


Vivian looked stunned.



"I've heard about your situation, Miss Simpson,"Millie continued calmly. "Your illness has drawn a lot of attention. But whether I sell my song is mydecision. I'm not required to grant your dying wish.And frankly, I don't even understand what you plan to do with it."



She paused, and then added, "Is it for one of your livestreams? Or... for your funeral?"


"You..." Vivian gasped, bursting into a fit of coughs.


Brandon reached for her, patting her back gently.Then he glared at Millie.



It was the first time he had looked at her since she walked into the room.



"Don't you think that was too harsh?" he asked sharply.


His brows were drawn tight, eyes cold. His lips pressed together, his wwhole face carrying anger.


Millie looked at him.


He had changed clothes. Not the outfit from yesterday.


She remembered pairing his suit jackets withmatching shirts and ties in the large wardrobe in their home. And he was wearing one of the sets.


He must have gone back home. He must have seen that she had moved out. Yet nothing in his expression showed that he cared.


So be it.



Millie sat up, her head tilted down behind the dark lenses of her sunglasses. She didn't look at him again.


"I think what's really harsh is trying to force someone into selling something they've refused to part with,"she said quietly. "If you choose to do that,then you should expect that not everyone will respond politely."


Brandon scowled even more, the displeasure in his face thickening.


Before he could respond, Vivian leaned in, her voice gentle. "Brandon, it's okay. Let me speak for myself."


The lights in the room cast a soft golden glow, butVivian's crisp white Celine suit made her look even paler.


"Eva, I truly love this song," she began, her eyes drifting toward Brandon. "It reflects so much of what I've been feeling. It's full of passion, love that hides beneath the surface, and a kind of fear-fear of losing, fear of holding on too tightly. It speaks about giving everything, about the happiness that comes with that,and..."


Vivian paused. "And the sorrow that comes from knowing the end is near. That kind of sorrow eats at you, slowly. It keeps you up at night, makes you question everything. But what moved me the most was the way the song lets go at the end. That release. That peace. It feels like what I'm going through now-accepting what is, letting go of everything else, and just living what little time I have left."



Her voice swayed between barely holding it together and sounding perfectly at peace, as if she had faced something so heavy that even her calm was fragile.Brandon, sitting beside her, watched her with concern, his expression soft in a way Millie had never seen before.



Seven years of being with him, and she had never seen that look. Not once.



Millie felt like an outsider looking in on a couple weathering a storm together.


But she wasn't an outsider. She was,his wife.And somehow, none of it moved her.


What a shame!



"Eva, this song tells so much of my story. I really understand what you were trying to say when you wrote it. And wouldn't it be nice to sell it to someone who actually feels it the way you meant it?" Vivian continued, her voice still soft.


She spoke as if that should be enough to convince anyone.


It made perfect sense-if you were going to sell a song, it might as well go to someone whounderstood it.


But Millie wanted to laugh.


Because the song was never about romance-it was about choosing the wrong person, about trusting someone who didn't deserve it.



It was the story of falling for Brandon, of how happy she'd once been to become his wife, only to uncover the betrayal, endure the heartbreak, and then, finally,find the strength to walk away.


And now Vivian, with her sad smile and soft voice,was trying to twist that pain into her own love story.To use what had broken Millie as a plea for sympathy.


The irony of it all made Millie laugh loudly.


Brandon scowled, his eyes narrowing.


"Eva, if Vivian even saw this song, it means you put it up for sale," he said, his tone flat and steady, the way he always sounded when handling deals-no emotion, just business. "Now you've changed your mind. That either means you don't like the buyer-orthe price."


He looked straight at her, but her sunglasses gave nothing away.


"A songwriter of your level can easily command over a million," Brandon continued. "With royalties, the value climbs even higher. Ten million. I believe that is a good price for you to sell at."


Millie laughed even harder.


Ten million? That was generous.


She knew full well that a songwriter like herself would be lucky to get a few hundred thousand from selling a song.


He wasn't making that offer for the song. He was doing it for Vivian.


Millie laughed until her sides hurt. She could barely breathe.



Vivian looked confused, and then offended.


"Eva," she said, trying to stay calm, "that's already avery generous offer. I'm planning to use this track for a show called Heavenly Melody. You've probably heard of it. I want this to be my signature performance..."


She kept talking, but Charles had heard enough.


He slammed his palm against the table and stood."She already said she doesn't want to sell it,Brandon. Stop pushing her."


Brandon didn't move. He stayed seated, his eyes cold and blank. Even seated, he looked intimidating.


Millie wiped the corners of her eyes, still smiling. She reached for Charles' sleeve.


"It's alright. I'll sell it," she said.


Heavenly Melody was the very show she planned to be on.
###Chapter 9 She's Talented





Surprise flickered across Charles' face, though he quickly masked it.


Deep down, this was the exact outcome he'd been hoping for.


Millie's presence today was no accident; he'd invited her with a specific purpose in mind.


His position as the Evans family's third son contrasted sharply with Brandon's role as head of the Watson Group.



Avoiding direct confrontation with someone as influential as Brandon was always preferable, if possible.


Still, Millie's easy agreement caught him off guard.


Convincing her in private was something he'd actually prepared for.
Brows knitted in thought, Charles studied Millie's expression, searching for any clue about her true feelings.


Oversized sunglasses shielded every hint of her emotion, leaving him no closer to an answer.


A single, clear sentence broke the silence. "Let's get the paperwork underway," Millie said.


She had no plans to explain herself with Brandon and Vivian standing there, so she kept her eyes on the polished wooden desk in the office, its fine grain etched with delicate patterns. Even so, her heart stayed steady and calm.


Her voice rang with quiet resolve. "Evans Entertainment will represent me. We'll handle everything according to the usual process." A pointed glance at Charles made her intent unmistak<able.



No hesitation from him-he quickly motioned to the staff, signaling them to assist Vivian with the arrangements.A flash of scorn crossed Vivian's eyes as she looked Millie up and down.


"Well, that's quite the turnaround," said Vivian, her tone laced with quiet sarcasm as she threw shade at Millie for backing down after standing her ground on not selling the song.


Millie answered with nothing more than a calm smile.She rose from her seat and headed out of the office without a word.


As she made her way through the corridor, she paused to pour herself a cup of coffee.


Not long after,Charles caught up to her.


"Millie," he said, his voice cutting through the quiet.


She turned and gave him a small nod. "Mr. Evans."


His face shifted with emotion, unreadable at first.Then, after a moment of silence, he finally asked,"Why?"


The only answer Millie offered was a knowing smile.A searching look settled on Charles as Millie spoke."Didn't you hear her? Vivian's planning to compete on 'Heavenly Melody.'"


Puzzlement flickered in his gaze, but he nodded,sharing what he knew. "From what l've heard,Vivian's not really entering as a contestant-she'll be more of a guest judge, there to shower praise."


That deepened Millie's smile, a glint of amusement.lighting her eyes.


Coffee set gently aside, she leaned forward. "Tell me,Mr. Evans-doesn't this whole thing strike you as just a bit entertaining?"


His confusion lingered, but he listened.


Millie explained everything in a calm, measured tone,"Brandon and I have already filed for divorce. It'll be finalized in thirty days. He told me Vivian's the reason-he wants to marry her. And now she's using my song as her big breakthrough. Sooner or later,people are going to find out I'm the one who wrote it.Funny,isn't it?"Recognition dawned on Charles, a flicker of understanding brightening his face.


A small, secretive smile touched Millie's lips. "I'm looking forward to their faces when the truth comes out."



Curiosity tugged at him. "So this is your way of getting even?"


Rather than answer right away, Millie wrapped her hands around the coffee cup.


Bitterness rose with the steam, swirling quietly inside her.


Her voice, when it camne, was soft but clear. "No, not at all."



Peace was all she wanted-just a clean. break. "My only wish was to sever all ties, start over, and focus on what I love," she said, gaze drifting toward the trees swaying in the wind outside. "But they've insisted on playing games. I that's the case, I might as well play along."A thoughtful silence settled between them, and Charles' features grew more complicated with every word.



Once, the Bennett family had been the toast of Crobert, and these rich kids-Charles and Millie included-ran in the same circles.


Their friendship had roots stretching all the way back to childhood.



In those days, Millie was the dazzling heiress, the unreachable dream for half the city's eligible bachelors.



Fortunes changed swiftly, though, and after the Bennett family's downfall, most people had all but forgotten Millie ever existed.


Society never promised fairness.


Reminders of the past often slipped into Charles'thoughts. He turned away, making sure Millie could not read his expression.


He finally broke the silence, saying, "Sometimes adivorce is the best outcome."


A quiet look of relief appeared in Millie's eyes as she faced him. "I appreciate your honesty, and everything else."



Charles answered with a knowing smile, "It works out for both sides."



Those words rang true.


Power struggles had become the Evans family's daily routine. All three Evans brothers set their sights on the Evans Group, each one determined to seize control.


Only the one with the sharpest edge would claim victory in the end.


Their conversation drifted on a little longer. Charles promised he would keep Millie and Brandon's soon-to-be divorce a secret, and then he excused himself to return to his business calls.


They would discuss details of her joining the show Heavenly Melody in another time.For a while, Millie stayed behind. The warmth of her coffee lingered in her hands as she watched the wind dance through the leaves outside.


Time slipped by until she heard footsteps drawing near.



First came the familiar outline. Brandon's presence seemed to fill the room even before he spoke.


She recognized him instantly, so she slipped her mask back on and turned away, hoping to shield herself.



"Why did you go through with this?" Brandon's voice broke the quiet before she could step away. His tone carried an unmistakable weight-the sort of confidence built through years of influence.


His cologne, Tom Ford Oud Wood, drifted over to her,mingling with a hint of smoke.


It was a scent she had come to associate with him alone.


He continued, "You have a gift for writing music. Your
songs reveal real depth. Why put up obstacles for someone who's running out of time?"


A hint of sadness welled up inside Millie when she heard his words.



With deliberate slowness, Millie faced Brandon.She noticed the subtle crease between his brows as he watched her.


A small question lingered on her lips. "You think I have talent?" She searched his eyes, barely above a whisper.


An uncertain look flickered in Brandon's gaze.


"Of course you do," said Brandon.


No one could argue with that.


Yet a soft laugh escaped Millie.


Talent? Was that what he saw in her?



Memories of their wedding night surfaced.


That evening, Brandon had struck a match, lit a
cigarette, and let the smoke drift through their fresh,unfamiliar new house.



"Millie, I'm worried about Grandpa," he said. "Your little hobby of songwriting will have to wait. Right now, I want you to help take care of my grandparents."


His words had floated in the air, detached and light,much like the cigarette smoke curling toward the ceiling.


She had offered a compromise. Balancing family and work seemed possible.


Brandon had only frowned. "You don't need to keep working where everyone can see you."


She eventually gave in to his wishes.


Convincing herself that Derek's declining health truly required her attention, she tried to set aside her doubts.



Even so, a nagging thought stayed with her.Was Brandon trying to keep her away from the public eye now that she was married? Or had he never believed in her abilities at all?


Any explanation, if there was one, remained unspoken between them, no matter how close they'd once been.


Brandon's attention returned to the woman standing before him.


There was always something about her that felt oddly familiar to him, like a face he couldn't quite place but was certain he'd seen before.


Yet, when he took in her glossy hair, the sharp lines of her designer outfit, and the heels that made her legs stand out, he struggled to find any genuine connection.



Irritation crept in. A strange notion settled in his mind -this woman reminded him of Millie, though he couldn't explain why.
###Chapter 10 Medication Became An Option





There was a trace of perfume in the air that he didn't recognize. Brandon blinked, pulling himself back from his thoughts.



For a brief moment, Millie's face from the day before came to mind-soft-spoken, clear-eyed, like a fresh lily.


The woman sitting across from him now felt like something else entirely.


Still, he told himself the similarity made sense. Being musician must have shaped them in similar ways.


With that in mind, Brandon felt more at ease.


"Vivian's already bought the song at a satisfactory price," he said, voice firm. "I trust you won't make this difficult for her."Millie gave a calm smile.


"You don't need to worry," she said. "The song's all hers now."



"Good." Brandon nodded, giving her a firm look.

"Don't forget you said that."


Millie just smiled again.


Brandon turned and strode off, leaving the room as·abruptly as he had entered.


Millie watched him make his way down the hallway,saw the way he reached Vivian and gently held her arm, as if touching a fragile work of art.


Together,they went out.


A few minutes later, Millie's phone buzzed.


She glanced down. It was a message from Brandon."I told my grandfather yesterday you weren't feeling well, so you couldn'tcome. This weekend, you'll be going with me to visit them."


This was a command.Millie scoffed.



She didn't reply. Instead, she turned and walked off in the opposite direction.







Brandon had already helped Vivian intothe car.


He fastened her seatbelt with care, but he didn't start the engine right away. Instead, he checked his phone.


Millie still hadn't responded.


Vivian noticed his uneasiness.



Her eyes dampened, and she looked down, voice low. "Brandon... will you be upset with me for all this?"



Brandon turned his head toward her, brows tightening."Why would you say that?"


Vivian gave a small, sad smile. "Wasn't Millie a songwriter before? I thought maybe it bothers you..."He didn't answer. He just looked at her.


The truth was, it bothered him, even just a little.


But Vivian didn't have time-not much of it. If these last six months were all she had, he would let her have what she wanted.



Vivian noticed his silence, so she lowered her face and let herself look remorseful.


For a while, the car was silent. Only the slow tapping of Brandon's left fingers on the steering wheel filled the quiet.


After a moment, Vivian spoke again. "I just want to feel what she felt. To know what it's like to be loved like that."



She looked up at Brandon, her eyes glassy. "I want you to love me the way you loved her."


Brandon's fingers stilled. He closed his eyes and let out a long breath.


"Don't think like that," he said. "The divorce hasalready been filed. We're just waiting out the legal process. I'm with you now, Vivian."


Vivian nodded and gave him a faint smile.


"Let's head home," Brandon said, pocketing his phone and starting the car.


Vivian lowered her head again, but this time, there was a spark in her eyes-a flicker of satisfaction.


She had made up her mind.


The timing was right. Sympathy was on her side. The public believed her story. Now, it was time to push Millie completely out of the picture.


She wanted everything. Brandon. And Millie's career.


That was why she had insisted on joining the show Heavenly Melody.


Vivian wanted Millie crushed and broken enough to leave town completely. She wanted to replace Millie-to walk into her life and claim everything that used to be hers.And right now, it felt like the universe was on her side.





Vivian pushed back the grin creeping onto her face.She leaned against the seat, closed her eyes, and put on her usual act of weakness.







Meanwhile,Millie had already signed the agreement with Charles.



Evans Entertainment, one of the backers of "Heavenly Melody," was a key investor in the show,and Charles had enough influence to move things behind the scenes.



Knowing Vivian would be participating, he set up a confidentiality agreement just for Millie.


She would compete under a new identity, Serena Ellsworth, wearing a mask throughout the show. At the right time, when the impact would be greatest,she'd remove the mask and reveal herself.


Until then, only Charles would know who "SerenaEllsworth" really was.


The show focused on songwriting, vocals, and performance, so the mask was just another hook to draw viewers in. Other labels were doing their own stunts too. No one questioned it.


The name "Serena" was carefully chosen,symbolizing her inner peace. She really liked it. It felt like a small kind of rebirth.


With everything in place, she left for the hospital.


Her appointment with the doctor had been pushed to the afternoon. The timing now felt just right.


After a quick lunch, she headed to the clinic.


She knocked softly on the door and waited as the doctor glance towards her direction.


With a small nod, she stepped inside and pulled the door shut behind her.



Rita Carpenter looked up from her notes. She gave Millie a warm smile. "You look a little different today,"she said. "How have you been feeling?"


Rita had been Millie's therapist since her depression diagnosis.


Millie had lived through both joy and heartbreak.There had been bright days. But there had been many more shadowed ones.


For the first twenty years of her life, she had been.able to hold on, thanks to the people around her.Then Vivian showed up.


Millie had already felt that something wasn't right,even before the anonymous messages were sent to her phone.



She'd shown Brandon the provoking texts, hoping for clarity. Instead, he accused her of trying to frame Vivian.



That was the day she walked into the psychiatry department for the first time.


The diagnosis had been moderate depressionRita had recommended medication, but Millie had wanted a baby-so she chose therapy instead.


Brandon hadn't taken her mental health seriously. He hadn't even known she was seeing someone.


"I'm doing better than I was," Millie answered. "I've decided to let go of a few things. I think that might help."


Rita nodded,relieved.


"How's everything else? Day-to-day life?" Rita asked.


She had been following the media storm too. Vivian's livestreams, her cancer, the headlines-it was all too public to miss.


Even though she appeared relieved that Millie mentioned she was doing better, she didn't really feel hopeful about her situation. And it was because she understood how much Brandon had meant to Millie.


Millie looked at the desk in front of her. She didn't speak for a few seconds. Then, quietly, she smiled."Actually, not great."Saying that, she felt a lump in her throat but restrained from breaking down.


"Dr. Carpenter," she said, "I've decided to take medication."


For a long time, she had hoped that things with Brandon could improve and that they would have a child together. That hope had kept her from taking medication. But now, she didn't want him or a child.with him. Andso, medication became an option.


Rita studied Millie for a moment, a look of worry on her face. Millie looked so much thinner. Being a professional, Rita began to wonder if she should reach out to the patient's family at this point, which-in this case-was Brandon.
###Chapter 11 Come With Me





If anyone had to be contacted in MAillie's family,Brandon-still legally her husband-would be the first name on that list. But Rita set the thought aside, just for now.


"Medication will help," she said gently. "But you'll still'need regular sessions with me."


Millie nodded, already aware of that.


"Let's try hypnosis today," Rita said.


Hypnosis...


Millie paused, considering it. Then she gave a quiet nod.


She followed Rita over to the couch and slowly lay down, closing her eyes.


The moment her eyelids shut and her mind drifted away, everything turned dark and scattered.
At last, her mind cleared, and she found herself standing in the dim light of a grey, overcast day.


It didn't take long before Millie realized exactly where she was.



The fluorescent lights were cold and sharp. The stillness around her was heavy, like a thick fog.


In front of her was her father's corpse, wrapped.tightly in white cloth.


She remembered this day-years ago, when she had been called in to identify him.


Her mother had been sobbing uncontrollably beside her, but Millie could barely move. She had just stood there, eyes locked on her father's pale, battered face.



That year, he had jumped from a high-rise building.After that, their family had collapsed.


The memory morphed. Suddenly, she was standing in front of the Bennett Group building.
Her father's blood and brain matter were splattered across the pavement-red mixed with white.


She stood still, unable to move, staring into her father's eyes-eyes that refused to rest in peace.


All around her was chaos-loud voices, arguments,screams from her mother that tore through the noise.And people-so many people-circling them like vultures, ready to tear off whatever remained.


Unable to fight them off, Millie was shoved, falling straight into her father's blood.


Everywhere,teeth and claws.


And then-shoes. A pair of polished shoes appeared in front of her.



"The Watson family will protect Millie from now on."She knew that voice.


She looked up. There he was. Young Brandon. Still a teenager, but already standing like a man who knew how to lead.He wore his school uniform neatly, and his eyes-calm and unwavering-felt like magic.


"If anything happens," he said, "come to me."


At his signal, people behind him sprang into action.Everything that had felt out of control suddenly fell into place.


The crowd backed off.


He crouched beside her, pulled out a handkerchief,and gently wiped her bloodstained cheek.


"Come with me," he said, holding out his hand.



She took it. It was warm and steady.







Back in the present, a tear slid down the cheek of the 25-year-old Millie.



She opened her eyes slowly.



So much had happened since then.Brandon had stepped in. He had taken her and her mother away from the disaster, using his family's power to settle the mess.


The Bennett family still crumbled. The title of a rich heiress disappeared. The life of comfort and wealth vanished. But she and her mother had survived.



How could she not have loved him after that?


And yet-letting go had happened all at once.


Millie closed her eyes again. Her brows drew together as pain pressed into her chest and reached her fingertips.


Rita had been watching quietly. She exhaled slowly."It doesn't seem like you've really let go of him," she said softly.


Millie didn't answer right away. She sat up,taking her time.



Then, with the edge of her hand, she wiped away the tear.When her eyes met Rita's again, they were clear.Steady. "I have," she whispered.


What was behind her would stay there. Now was now.


Millie knew she had to face the mess left behind by the Bennett family on her own.


Brandon had chosen Vivian. That decision had shattered her, but it was also the、closure she needed. There was nothing left for her to hold on to.


Just like when her mother remarried-everyone had their own path, and this time, Millie was choosing hers.


She had made up her mind to let go. Slowly but surely, she was moving on.


Rita listened carefully and nodded, absorbing every word.


Her clinic wasn't part of any hospital. It was a private,upscale facility that offered peace, discretion, and full medical services-designed for wealthy clientsRecords were kept in-house only, never entered into public hospital databases. That was why Millie had picked this place in the first place.


She didn't want anyone to know what she was going through.


Not even Alexia, her best friend, knew about it.


After their session, Rita wrote her a prescription.


Millie accepted the small bottle of pills, tucked it in her bag, and walked back to her car.


The dosage was printed clearly on the label.


She had a bottle of water right there in the cup holder. She could take the first tablet now.



But she paused.


Her eyes dropped to her belly.


Not yet. She would wait until the pregnancy was terminated. A few more days wouldn't changeanything.


Millie placed the bottle back in her bag.


Just then, her phone buzzed-


Dozens of notifications lighting up her screen on the show Heavenly Melody.


She tapped into them, her brow furrowing as she saw the trending topics.


#VivianMusicShow


#VivianHeavenlyMelody


#VivianPureAngel


One of the links was a new video from Vivian's social media channel.


Vivian appeared in frame-delicate as ever, her body slightly hunched but her smile unwavering.


She looked soft, pale, and graceful.


"Yes, the producers of Heavenly Melody invited me,"she said, smiling gently. "I looked into the show'sconcept and really liked it, so l accepted. I'll be a guest judge during the first live broadcast of the show in a few days. I hope you'll watch. And because it's a music show," she added, "I've also prepared an original song."


Her eyes were red, her face almost translucent under the lighting, like a porcelain doll placed in the middle of her flower studio.



"Knowing I don't have much time left," she continued, "I've reflected on love, hurt,despair...and all the pieces of my life. That's where the song came from. It'll be released on streaming platforms at the same time as the live show. I hope it brings strength to anyone going through something painful."


The camera panned slightly to show her bowing amid a lush spread of blossoms inside her studio.


Beneath the video, an entertainment page had already published commentary. "Sources say Vivian's original song is breathtaking. She composed, wrote, and performed it herself. Many people in the recording studio reportedly cried whenthey heard it. It turns out Vivian's not only a top-tier florist-she's a talented songwriter too."


The comments kept rolling in.


A short 25-second instrumental clip of Vivian's "original" song had been leaked and was already taking over the Internet.


It didn't take long before content creators began using the audio as background music for their videos -and each one went viral.



Comment sections overflowed.


"| can't believe Vivian is this good at songwriting. I've been playing those 25 seconds on loop and looking forward to the full song!"


"She's so talented. Beautiful, successful, now writing songs-and she's dying? Only six months to live. It's too sad."



"Millie spent her whole life trying to make a name,and now she's been overshadowed by Vivian's 25seconds."
###Chapter 12 She's Pregnant





Word of Millie quickly spread after that first viral mention. Soon, the Internet was overflowing with heated opinions.


"Didn't Millie say she was some kind of songwriter?She's been around forever, but has she even had one song make it big?"


"| can't say for certain, but what I've heard is that Millie stepped away from the spotlight after she married Brandon. Word is, she's been enjoying a quiet, comnfortable domestic life as a housewife ever since."


"Can someone please tell me what Brandon sees in Millie? Vivian is on another level entirely!"


"Absolutely. Sometimes fate just isn't fair. Vivian's got all that talent, but only half a year left. It's so cruel.""In songwriting, nobody holds a candle to Vivian.She's the real deal-pure and kind."


"Millie should really just step aside already!"


"Let's be honest, if Millie had any dignity left, she'd let go of Brandon and stop hanging onto him like that."


"I'll always support Vivian with Brandon. They just make sense together."


"Brandon belongs with Vivian, not Millie!"






With every passing hour, the cheers for Vivian and the judgment against MAillie only got louder.


Millie barely had time to gather her thoughts before her phone rang.


After a pause, she saw Charles' name and finally answered.


Charles' voice erupted with frustration as soon as she picked up. "Vivian's got some nerve! Did you seethe short video she posted? Seriously?! They paid ten million for usage rights, not ownership. Now she's acting like your song is her masterpiece.Copyright belongs to you, Millie. If anyone should claim that song, it's you. You ought to sue!"


A soft, thankful smile tugged at Millie's lips while she listened to him.


She did her best to settle him down. "Mr. Evans,please try to calm yourself."


"Calm myself? How can l?" said Charles, his anger rising. "You need to stay away from those comments right now. Vivian is stirring things up, and the crowd online is taking her side! Their praise for her is just ridiculous and disgusting."


Hearing Charles stand up for her made Millie's chest feel a little lighter, the warmth of his support settling over her.



"You need to hear me out, Charles." Millie tried to put his mind at ease. "Right now, all Vivian is doing is making claims. If the song eventually comes out withcredit going to 'Eva' or 'Evans Entertainment,' then her words will all just be empty noise. Suing her would drag Evans Entertainment and Eva into court as the plaintiffs, and that would mean we'd have to reveal the fact that I am Eva. Honestly, I'm just not ready for that yet."


Gradually, Charles' anger started to fade as Millie explained her thinking.


Her logic made sense, even if he didn't like it.


Nothing was set in stone until the official release anyway.


Somehow, the sound of his own name coming from Millie grounded him.


"I just hate seeing those awful comments online,"said Charles, letting out a sigh. "Vivian's taking advantage of you."


Millie's eyes wandered to the bustling city outside the window, a quiet laugh escaping her.


People on the outside didn't have the slightest ideawho she really was.


Even Brandon, of all people, never truly saw her potential.


They called her the Bennett family's pampered princess, nothing more.


No one seemed to believe she was anything but spoiled.


After everything that happened with the Bennetts,had anyone ever considered she might try to bring the family glory back?


No one had taken her seriously, and all along,they had been looking right past what she was truly capable of.


Few words left Millie's lips, but her thoughts stayed sharp.


Despite everything, the vicious gossip online did get under her skin.


She was used to criticism, but some things still hurt.Also, Brandon's opinion lingered at the back of her mind. Did he really believe all the stories about Vivian?



Or worse, was he the one pulling the strings behind the scenes?



···


At that moment, Brandon focused on handling the.company's latest projects.


The Watson Group had grown into a powerhouse,leading breakthroughs in global tech, financial ventures, product design, and entertainment.


Years back, most people only knew Watson Group as an old-school, conventional business.


Transforming the company's future, Brandon introduced bold strategies and pushed for innovation on every front.


Competitors gradually lost their edge as Brandon subtly,yet consistently, kept them in check.His reputation for brilliance was now well established.


Although Brandon stood alone as the Watson family's only successor, he was a match for any of the city's elite clans.



A string of back-to-back meetings finally ended.Brandon leaned back in his chair at the very top of the tower, rubbing his forehead to clear the tension.


From the executive office, he could see the city of Crobert stretching out beyond the glass walls.


In the heart of Crobert, the Watson building dominated the skyline, with busy streets weaving below. Many dreamed of standing where Brandon did.



A subtle vibration from his phone broke the silence of his office.



Vivian's message flashed across the screen. "When you wrap up at the office, want to leave together?"
Elsewhere, Vivian lounged on her studio sofa,scrolling through the online chatter with a satisfied grin.


"Nicely done," she remarked, speaking to someone over the phone. "Keep the pressure on Millie.I want my name trending everywhere before the big broadcast. Make sure everyone's talking about me."


Once the call ended, Vivian faced her caregiver,impatience flickering in her eyes.


"Out with it," Vivian said sharply, not one for small talk.



The caregiver shifted awkwardly, wrestling with her conscience.


"Are you sure about this, Miss Simpson?" the caregiver asked. "If Evans Entertainment decides to take legal action over copyright, what happens then?"



A dismissive laugh left Vivian's lips. "Isn't ten million enough for them? What more do they want?"
"But it still feels risky..." Concern lingered in the caregiver's voice.


Across the room, Vivian tapped her screen, her attention half-occupied by her phone as she waited for Brandon to respond.


With a hint of amusement, she explained, "Evans Entertainment helped fund Heavenly Melody. The more attention this stirs up, the better it is for their.share of the profits when the show's òn. They have every reason to turn a blind eye to my methods.Besides, their musicians stand to benefit from the extra publicity. If things get tricky, I can always promise to help promote their people, to0."


The unexpected logic left the caregiver momentarily speechless.


Seeing the shock on her face gave Vivian a rush of satisfaction.



"Most things can be negotiated, you know." Feeling self-satisfied, Vivian decided to impart a little unsolicited wisdom.Her tone turned almost boastful. "Take my studio for example. It started as nothing. Can you even guess how I built it into what it is now?"


The caregiver only shook her head, unable to answer.


Pride sparkled in Vivian's eyes, a sly grin tugging at her lips.


No straightforward explanation came from her.Instead, she teased, "Why don't you try and figure that out for yourself? Let's see how much you can actually grasp."


Her success story, though, was hardly a mystery. The "Luxury Villa Floral Display" had put her name on the map.


Every important client came through Brandon in one way or another-whether it was him directly, his network of friends, or people hoping to curry favor with him.



For that reason, Brandon was the one person she refusedto let slip away.Left puzzling over the conversation, the caregiver kept her questions to herself.


Vivian's attention drifted back to her phone.


Online chatter about Millie caught her eye, and one comment in particular stood out. "Millie spent her whole life trying to make a name, and now she's been overshadowed by Vivian's 25 seconds."


That line drew a loud, satisfied laugh from Vivian.


"You really thought you could compete?" Vivian sneered. "Millie, you're nothing special."


Suddenly,her phone buzzed with a new notification.


A quick glance at the screen made Vivian's expression darken.


The message was blunt. "Found out why Millie went to the hospital. She's been pregnant for over a month."
###Chapter 13 Car Crash




Within the walls of the recording studio, Millie was rehearsing her performance for the show Heavenly Melody.


No matter how many times she ran through her part,the spark just wasn't there.


A shift in scenery sounded appealing, so she slipped out of her current outfit and wandered next door to the dance studio, hoping that a bit of movement might shake things loose.


Choreography, even if simple, might add some much-needed flair-even if Heavenly Melody mainly focused on music itself.


Sprawling across several floors, this practice complex featured everything from dance halls and vocal booths to a makeup suite, cafe, and even a storage wing-all under the Evans Entertainment banner.Everyone in Crobert knew the Evans name. Their empire stretched into countless industries, and the building's state-of-the-art setup was the envy of many.


A wide range of idols and musicians, including those with no ties to Evans Entertainment, often showed up to rehearse or book the space for their own use.


After tying the knot with Brandon, Millie's routine.centered around three main priorities.


Her mornings often began with Brandon's grandparents, tending to their needs and keeping them company.


Managing Brandon's calendar and dealing with Watson Group's confidential paperwork had also become second nature, sometimes in tandem with the office secretaries.



When the Bennett family fortunes collapsed,Watson Group swept in and assumed full control, even setting up a dedicated division to handle all remaining affairs.Things had changed-the faces were different and procedures had shifted-but Millie adapted with ease.


Visiting the Evans Entertainment practice center was another regular part of her life. On paper, she chalked it up to her dedication to music.


Behind the scenes, she spent these visits recording new demos under Eva's name.


People barely blinked when they saw Millie at the building. She came and went so often that her presence felt almost routine.


Getting ready for a dance session, she pulled her hair into a ponytail and changed into the same workout clothes she always wore.


Unbeknownst to her, someone stood quietly outside,eyes following her every move through the glass.


Running through one dance after another, she still couldn't find a groove that satisfied her.


Something about today refused to click-nothingabout the music or her choreography felt right.


An uneasy feeling settled in, prickling beneath her skin as if she was waiting for the other shoe to drop.


Anxiety crept in, stealing her focus and clouding her mind.


A slow inhale steadied Millie's nerves as she forced her eyes shut, seeking a moment of stillness.


No amount of effort brought the breakthrough she craved, and finally she abandoned her practice for the night.


A glance at her phone revealed the hour, it was already pushing 9 PM.


Fatigue weighed her down. Millie dabbed at her brow,shrugged off the sweat, and decided to call it quits,hoping tomorrow would be better.


The endless demands of the day had drained her.Without bothering to swap out her clothes or even change her shoes, she tossed a jacket over her shoulders and made her way toward the exit.
April's warmth had settled over Crobert, making the city buzz even after dark.


By 9 PM, the streets below were coming alive,brimming with neon lights and the thrum of nightlife.


City lights flashed past the building's windows, their glow a mix of exhaustion and restless energy.


Millie rode the elevator down, each second making.her more eager to get home.


Crossing through the dim parking garage, she felt a wave of unease roll over her, cold and sudden.


An unfamiliar rhythm hammered in her chest, every beat loud in her ears.


Without warning, instinct kicked in-her legs propelled her straight into the nearest flower bed dirt scattering beneath her feet.


Almost immediately, a car shot past the spot where she'd been standing, the rush of air from its speed tossing her coat.A chill prickled her skin as realization hit-she'd barely dodged disaster.


If she'd been even a second slower, the impact would have been unavoidable.



Before the shock fully set in, the black vehicle screeched to a halt, and then began circling back,headlights blazing toward her hiding place.


A low wall ringed the flower bed, just high enough to force the car to slow down, but not enough to block its determined approach. Whoever was behind the wheel wasn't simply passing by.


Dread wormed its way through Millie's thoughts.


Was she being targeted?


What could possibly motivate someone to do this?


Should she try to run, or stay hidden and hope for help?


Had this person been tracking her movements since earlier, watching from the studio's shadows? Ormaybe she was up against more than one set of eyes -one waiting outside, another lurking within the building, both lying in wait for the perfect moment to strike?



A thousand questions raced through her mind, but Millie forced herself to focus.



She needed a plan, and fast.


Rather than freeze, she watched the black car barrel closer, and at the last possible second, she dove sideways out of its path.


Metal collided with concrete as the car plowed into the flower bed, its engine howling in frustration.


Wasting no time, Millie sprinted toward her own car,adrenaline propelling her forward.


Doubling back into the building seemed like a trap;there was no telling if someone waited for her inside.



The open plaza nearby offered little safety, and crossing that distance could leave her exposed.Escape meant getting behind the wheel and reaching help-heading straight for the nearest police station was her best shot.



Thank goodness, her car was only steps away.


Pure survival instinct took over. She covered the ground in seconds and yanked the driver's door open.


No sooner had she slammed the door shut than a violent impact rocked the vehicle, the black car ramming into her with brute force. Dizziness crept in.A wave of nausea rolled through her, leaving her stunned.



A low groan slipped out. "Ugh..."


The other car pulled back, engine revving for another attack.


Gritting her teeth, Millie fought to clear her head,jamming the keys into the ignition and slamming her foot down on the gas.


"Bang!"Tires screeched as her car shot forward, while the black sedan spun out and smashed into another parked vehicle.


There was no time to look back. Millie veered onto the main road.


Once she saw the headlights in her rearview mirror,panic surged again. She fumbled for her phone,pressed 911, and prayed someone would answer before the car caught up.


A dispatcher answered almost instantly, her voice sharp and alert in Millie's ear.


"Hello, there's a black car with the license plate AB1234 tailing me. The driver just tried to crash into my vehicle. I'm heading down First Avenue toward the East City Police Station and need immediate assistance!" Millie explained the situation clearly prompting the operator to quickly relay the call to the appropriate station.


The road blurred past as Millie pressed harder on the accelerator, nerves stretched to the breaking point.Chaos had swept in so fast, she could barely keep up.





Inside her head, a storm of questions and possibilities spun out of control.


Who would go this far?


Names and faces flashed by, including Brandon,Vivian and everyone connected to the Watson or.Bennett families, but no clear suspect emerged.


A quick glance in the rearview mirror showed the threat still lingering, her heart pounding every time she checked.



Suddenly, the black car changed tactics, swerving off onto a quiet side street as if realizing the chase was over.


Seeing it disappear, Millie finally let herself exhale,lungs burning from the tension.


The connection to the emergency service stayed open,their steady guidance keeping her focused.She followed every direction, refusing to slow down until the stone arch of the East City Police Station appeared ahead and uniformed officers waved her in.


Relief crashed over her as she pulled into the designated parking space, hands trembling on the wheel.


With the danger finally behind her, Millie loosened her grip, shoulders sagging for the first time since、the whole nightmare began.


Sudden nausea swept through her, stronger now that the adrenaline faded.


A low groan slipped out, and pain twisted in her stomach, forcing her to lean forward as she tried to recover.
###Chapter 14 Did She Say Anything To You About It
A policewoman gently knocked on the window, her eyes full of concern as she looked at Millie.


Millie gripped her stomach, feeling sweat break out across her skin.


"Ma'am, are you alright?" asked the officer, anxiety clear in her voice as she beckoned the bystanders to come and help.


Millie realized the pain had something to do with the baby.


The symptoms were unmistakably those of a miscarriage.


Earlier, she had jumped and sprinted away from a car speeding through the parkinglot, only to be struck afterward by the same black vehicle while she was in her own car.Could her baby really be slipping away from her?


She had indeed decided to terminate the pregnancy,but...




Panic and sorrow flooded her mind without warning.


The thought of losing her child suddenly terrified Millie.




"Ma'am, please answer me. Open your door!" the policewoman screamed.


Millie's eyes clouded over, and though the pain was sharp and unrelenting, she still managed to push the car door open just before everything went black.







At the same time, lights flooded every floor of the Watson Group building, casting a glow that reached out into the night.


Brandon reviewed a proposal, exhausted from attending endless meetings throughout the day.


He had to make several crucial decisions before theday ended.


He had been working non-stop since the afternoon,his expression growing increasingly stern.


Everyone in the expansive conference room sat silently, unwilling to draw his attention.


Brandon lightly tapped the table with his left hand as he studied the report.


"Who's responsible for this project?" Brandon's tone was calm, yet his authority made everyone uneasy.


"It's me, Mr. Watson," answered a middle-aged man,standing up nervously as he wiped sweat from his forehead.



Brandon glanced at him, lips parting slightly as he instructed coldly, "Explain."


The middle-aged man wiped his forehead again.


"Well, it's... uh..." he stammered, failing to give a clear explanation and rambling through various excuses.He knew deep down he had botched the project.


"Enough," Brandon interjected,cutting him short.


Fear filled the man's eyes as he started trembling.


"Mr. Watson, please give me another chance," he begged. "I promise P'll fix it!"


Brandon frowned, prompting his secretary, Eugene Barnes, to step forward.


"When you proposed the project, you made grand promises," Eugene said firmly. "Now, who's responsible for this mess?"


"I was just-" The man, well into middle age, began to speak again, hoping to make himself understood.


"No more excuses," Eugene chimed in harshly. "The Watson Group fully backed this project, yet despite all the resources, you failed miserably. You do know why,don't you?"


The man opened his mouth to argue, but Brandon threw a document down in front of him."Corruption in such a small project is outrageous,"Brandon remarked sharply.


The middle-aged man turned pale as he read the document.



He tried to respond, his body trembling, but Eugene gave a signal.


The doors swung open, and the company's internal.inspection team entered,escorting him'out.


"Mr. Watson, I'm sorry. Please forgive me!" The middle-aged man's desperate voice faded into silence as he was led away,leaving the room eerily quiet.



Brandon cast a cold glance around the room, making sure everyone understood the consequences.


"Meeting adjourned," Brandon announced, standing and walking swiftly from the room.


Eugene accompanied Brandon back to the CEO's office.Noticing Brandon sink into the executive chair and rub his forehead tiredly, Eugene instructed an assistant to bring coffee immediately.



Brandon massaged his temples, briefly closing his eyes.





Exhaustion weighed heavily on him.


He knew perfection was unattainable, especially.within a massive corporation like Watson Group,where internal problems naturally arose.



He understood that clearly.


But recently, he couldn't pinpoint why the fatigue felt deeper than usual.


He heard footsteps approaching, followed by a gentle sound of a cup touching the desk.



"Brandon, drink some water. You've been working too late lately, and you need to take care of yourself.I've added that special essence you like." Oddly enough, the voice seemed familiar to Brandon.When Brandon opened his eyes, however, he saw Eugene standing there.


Looking down, he found only a steaming cup of coffee on the desk.


A faint tension pulled at Brandon's lips as he pressed them together in silence.


"Mr. Watson, do you not want coffee?" Eugene asked,noticing Brandon's mood.


Brandon's brow creased slightly, unsure about his own complicated feelngs.


"I know it's normally Mrs. Watson who gets your water ready," said Eugene, his voice apologetic. "couldn't find whatever essence she adds, and you looked exhausted, so I just went ahead and brought you coffee."


Yes, it had always been Millie beside him while he was working late.


Brandon closed his eyes again, feeling his headache grow stronger."Should I give Mrs. Watson a call and check with her?" Eugene asked carefully.


"That won't be necessary," Brandon answered.


Eugene gave a small nod, and the office slipped back into stillness.


The quiet that followed felt strange, almost unnatural.





Brandon couldn't remember the space ever feeling this hushed.



The silence began to grate on him, stirring a wave of frustration.



"What exactly is happening this month?" he asked,cutting through the quiet.


"Do you mean in terms of work, Mr. Watson?"Eugene asked in return.


"That's right."


"Well, back then, Mrs. Watson usually took care of smaller problems first, like what happened today withthe manager. You only got involved when something really needed your attention, so..."


Brandon opened his eyes and cast a look in Eugene's direction.



Catching the unspoken message, Eugene shifted uncomfortably and said, "Mr. Watson, I take full responsibility. I should have handled it better."


Brandon didn't come down hard on him. He simply gave a slight shake of his head. "Where's the contract for the new partnership?"


Eugene lowered his gaze even more. "I'm sorry, Mr.Watson. The team hasn't sorted it out yet."


Brandon let out a slow sigh and motioned for him to go.


Eugene, clearly relieved, turned and left the room without delay.


As Brandon stared at the shut office door, he couldn't ignore the truth. He had ended things with Millie so suddenly that many of the responsibilities
 she used to manage had fallen through the cracks.


The office sat in a hush, broken only by the soft ticking of the clock on the wall.


A sharp scent of coffee lingered in the air, its bitterness cutting through the stillness.


Steam curled up from the mug on his desk, and with it, Brandon's frown grew more pronounced.


He reached for his phone and read over the message he had sent Millie, where he asked her to come back with him to visit his grandparents on the weekend.


There was still no reply.


He could clearly recall the way she had firmly turned him down over the phone.


Was she still holding onto that anger?


As his eyes stayed fixed on the screen, a sudden knock at the door broke his focus.


He glanced up and saw Vivian standing in the doorway with a bright smile."Brandon," Vivian said as she walked in, her voice light. "I thought I'd drop by and keep you company."


Brandon slid his phone out of sight and gave her a small nod.


Vivian's eyes drifted toward Brandon's phone, but her face remained unreadable.


After a brief pause, she sat down slowly, her movements uncertain.


Brandon caught the shift in her demeanor and asked,"Is something bothering you?"


"Brandon, did Millie get in touch with you today?"Vivian asked, her voice measured.


He turned to her, arching his brows to urge her to go on.



"This afternoon, I posted a short video about joining Heavenly Melody. I only meant to follow the same path she once walked. I didn't expect the backlash online.." Vivian explained, watching his face for any hint of reaction.
She paused, and then asked carefully, "Did she say anything to you about it?"


Brandon's brow tightened. This afternoon? He had spent the entire day locked in meetings and hadn't kept up with anything online.


A glance at the clock told him it was already fifteen minutes past nine in the evening.



"There's something else I need to mention..." Vivian hesitated before adding, "When I left the studio at a quarter to nine, something felt off. It wasn't until l parked downstairs just now that I realized I'd been followed by paparazzi the entire way."


She looked genuinely regretful as she pulled out her phone and handed it to Brandon.


On the screen were a series of photos, showing her from the doors of Vivian Floral Design all the way to the Watson Group building. The headline above the images read, "Vivian spotted entering Watson Group late at night-rumored to be meeting Brandon."Just beneath the photos, the comment section was already buzzing with harsh remarks, many of them ridiculing Millie and speculating about her divorce.


"Brandon, I'm really sorry. I should have been more careful," said Vivian, her voice shaking slightly as her eyes began to well up.


Brandon gave a casual wave of his hand, brushing it off as nothing worth worrying about.


He had already made up his mind to make things official with Vivian once his divorce case was finalized.


But then there was Millie...


Just as the thought crossed his mind, his phone buzzed against the desk.


The clock had just struck twenty minutes past nine.


He reached for his phone, and there it was-Millie's name lit up on the screen.
###Chapter 15 She Was Hit By A Car
Brandon's brow creased without him realizing.


Standing nearby, Vivian caught a glimpse of Millie's name flashing on his phone screen. Her expression flickered-first with confusion, and then with something harder to name.


"Brandon?" she said gently, catching his pause.


He blinked, pulled back into the moment.


Just minutes earlier, Vivian had shown him the trending headlines about her supposed late-night visit. And now Millie was calling.


Was she calling to confront him? To throw those stories in his face?


With a small frown, Brandon hit decline. But barely a few seconds passed before the screen lit up again.


Still Millie.
The persistence irritated him.


"Are you not going to pick up?" Vivian asked, voice soft.




He declined the call once more and then switched his phone to Do Not Disturb.


"No need," he said, with finality.


Vivian opened her mouth like she might protest, but then thought better of it.


She nodded slowly, her face a careful blend of concern and restraint. But as she lowered her eyes,the briefest spark of satisfaction flashed through them.



She had planned this.


She'd walked him through the gossip, showed him the video clips, and repeated just enough of Millie's possible reactions to make sure he wouldn't answer.


"Let's go. It's getting late," Brandon said, reaching for his coat and helping her to her feet.
They stepped into the private elevator reserved for Watson Group's top floor.


Paparazzi cameras clicked as the doors closed behind them. And far from them, across the city,Millie was being wheeled out of an ambulance.


Blood seeped from her forehead, streaking acroSS the stretcher sheet. Her body was limp.


The hospital corridor spun in and out of her vision-the harsh ceiling lights flashing by.


The sounds around her blurred together, mixed with the tense voice of a woman in uniform calling out."I've called her husband twice and he's not answering. What should we do? Keep calling? What if he still doesn't pick?"


Another voice spoke. "Did you see that door? The whole thing's crushed. It's not just a bump to her head. We don't know what else is going on inside.Prioritize treatment.Keep trying him!"


"Got it!"There was more noise, louder this time, and Millie drifted again.


The sharp hospital scent filled her nose. She floated between alertness and fog, catching snatches of conversation she couldn't piece together. Then, a voice she recognized-Alexia's.


Alexia's voice was raised and frantic as she was taken into the emergency room. But then the world tilted again, and Millie blacked out.







Alexia was furious.



She had seen blood on Millie's face,soaked into her hair, as they wheeled her into the ER. It made her stomach twist.



By sheer luck, Millie had been brought to Crobert Hospital. Alexia had been working overtime that night, passing through when she noticed the flashing lights and noise. Something had told her to stop and check.The medical team had been unsure of Millie's condition, unaware that she was pregnant.


Thankfully, Alexia was already aware of Millie's situation, and being the daughter of the hospital's director-all of it helped.


Without that, Millie might not have gotten the care she needed in time.



Alexia walked over to one of the officers who was holding Millie's phone. The officer seemed unsure of who to call next.


She introduced herself as a doctor and said she was a friend of Millie's. When she overheard the officer trying to reach Millie's family, she quietly reached for the phone and took over.


The screen showed multiple missed calls. None of them answered.



Then her own phone began to buzz.


She glanced at the screen. A headline popped up.

"Brandon Watson and Vivian Simpson spottedleaving Watson Group together."


Alexia's stomach turned. So this was why Brandon wasn't answering-he was with Vivian.


Without hesitation, she tapped his number.


The first call went unanswered.


The second connected just as the final ring buzzed.


"What is it?" came Brandon's voice, clipped and cold.





"What is it?" Alexia snapped. "Why haven't you been answering Millie's calls?"


Behind the wheel of his Aston Martin, Brandon's eyes narrowed.


"Did Millie tell you to call me?" His voice dropped lower,even colder.


"No," Alexia said. "I called you myself!"


At a red light, Brandon slowed to a stop. He glanced at the call log-dozens of missed calls from Millie.Of course.



She must have turned to Alexia for help. That was just like her.


The traffic light blinked green. Brandon eased his foot onto the pedal, and the Aston Martin glided forward,matching the quiet steadiness in his mood.


Millie had started calling the moment Vivian walked.into the Watson Group building.


He didn't need to ask why.


"You need to come to Crobert Hospital now," Alexia said.



"I'm not going," Brandon said flatly.


Millie must have gone crying to Alexia again.


That had become her pattern-complain, exaggerate,bring others into their private matters.


Ever since he asked for the divorce, she'd been unbearable."She was hit by a car," Alexia said, her voice suddenly hard and cold, stripped of emotion."If you still have any conscience left, get over here."


Brandon slammed the brakes. The tires screeched against the asphalt, and the car came to a stop.


A horn blared behind him, followed by a string of angry curses. But Brandon barely heard them. His grip on the steering wheel tightened as Alexia's call.cut off.


Beside him, Vivian had heard everything. She said nothing at first. Then her phone buzzed.


She glanced down, and then slowly tucked it away.She turned to Brandon, eyes wide with worry.


"Brandon...could somnething really have happened to her? We should go-now." Her voice trembled, full of concern. "This doesn't sound small. It looks serious.Thank God she was brought to Crobert Hospital.And Alexia's there-her best friend. She'll be in good hands, but... Brandon, we should hurry. Millie called you so many times-it must've been important."She looked like she might cry. But when she turned her face away, there was a gleam in her eyes that didn't match her tone.



A car accident was serious, yes. But now Millie had landed at a hospital where her best friend works and was run by her best friend's father.


And those missed calls could all look like something carefully planned. Could she really be calling him nonstop if she was really seriously injured?


Vivian wouldn't say it out loud, but her words suggested enough. Millie and Alexia, teaming up again.


Still,Vivian kept her mask on.


Tears rolled down her cheeks. "Brandon, I know you're with me now. But if something happened to her, and we didn't even go... I'd carry that guilt forever."



She turned away suddenly and coughed into her hand.When she looked up again, there was blood atthe corner of her mouth.


Seeing Brandon's eyes flicked toward her. Vivian quickly slipped the tiny blood capsule into her purse."I'm fine," she said, her voice shaking. "Don't worry about me. Just... get us to the hospital."


Brandon didn't say a word.


He restarted the car, and the Aston Martin turned,heading for Crobert Hospital.
###Chapter 16 Rare Blood Type
Inside Crobert Hospital, Alexia moved restlessly,pacing the floor with worry etched across her face.


Millie had Rh-negative blood, and back when she spoke about ending the pregnancy, Alexia had started to arrange for blood supply for the procedure in advance, just to be safe.


It hadn't been long since that moment, and the blood reserves still hadn't been restocked.


What if something went wrong and Millie needed a transfusion right away?


Alexia and Millie's friendship began before either of them could walk. Side by side, they were rarely seen apart, even as children.


A legacy of medicine surrounded Alexia from birth,her home brimming with tales of healing and textbooks that lined every shelf. Yet, much of her
knowledge was secondhand-gleaned from stories,not true emergencies.


Everything changed the day she and Millie slipped away for a secret adventure.


An itch for excitement led Alexia to swipe her brother's motorcycle and convince Millie to join her for a wild ride.


Wind whipped past as the two raced down back roads, Millie's striking looks only adding to Alexia's feeling of reckless freedom.


Speed kept building, until a sudden swerve sent them crashing to the ground.


Alexia counted herself lucky, escaping with just a few scrapes. Millie, however, was hurled across the gravel, her leg slamming into a rock and splitting open in a deep, ugly wound.


Blood spilled faster than Alexia had ever seen, and panic seized her as she fumbled to dial for help.


Every minute felt endless; the remote location meantthe ambulance took far too long.


By the time paramedics finally arrived, Millie was already ghostly pale from blood loss.


That terrifying experience was the first time Alexia realized just how serious Millie's rare Rh-negative blood type truly was.


No reserves existed at the small clinic, not even a single matching bag.


Watching her friend slip into shock, Alexia sobbed desperately, calling her father for help as the doctors scrambled to save Millie's life.


A miracle pulled Millie back from the brink that day,and Alexia knew she would never forget it.


Time passed, but the faded scar on Millie's leg never disappeared-no matter how many doctors tried, the mark refused to heal completely.


Determined to transform guilt into something meaningful, Millie invited Alexia to a tattoo studio,where they both chose matching designs tocelebrate the survival etched into their skin.


Memories like that lingered as Alexia grabbed her phone and began reaching out to every contact she could think of.


"Alexia speaking," she said to the first responder, her voice steady. "There's an accident-my friend is pregnant, and she could need Rh-negative blood at any moment."


Her next call connected to the Blood Donor Network."Yes, this is Alexia. I need support for a potential urgent case."


"Send as many donors as possible-even if we don't need them right away, I'd rather be prepared," she insisted.



A soft thank-you escaped her as she realized help was lining up.


Relief crept in only after she confirmed everyone was on alert and ready to act.


Still, uncertainty gnawed at her-no one could tell herfor sure how Millie was holding up.


In hopes of steadying her nerves, she turned back to the policewoman to get the full story.


What she learned left her rattled. "You mean someone actually tried to kill Millie?"


Thoughts tumbled through Alexia's head, each scenario darker than the last.



Perhaps some old rival of the Bennett family finally decided to settle a score.



Trouble often found Millie by association, especially now that she was tied to Brandon and the powerful Watson Group.



Public outrage had reached a fever pitch since Vivian's cancer began trending; Alexia knew how quickly online anger could turn into real-world danger.



Professional jealousies, everyday arguments, and unseen grudges only widened the pool of suspects.Anyone could have held a motive; the possibilities stretched endlessly in every direction.







Meanwhile, on the other side of the hospital doors,Millie drifted through a haze, her senses dulled and scattered.


Faint impressions of gloved hands and watchful eyes drifted in as unfamiliar doctors checked her condition.



The room pulsed with the sharp ring of metal and the steady hum of machines.


Voices floated through the haze, their words jumbled and distant, just out of reach.


All she managed to catch were bits and pieces-words like "pregnant" and "bleeding" floated past her in scattered whispers.


Her baby-she remembered now.


With effort that seemed to drain her last reserves,
she managed to whisper, "Please... save... my baby."


Regret twisted in her chest, sharp and sudden.


Back at the police station, just before she lost consciousness, fear had nearly swallowed her whole.


For so long, Millie had imagined a child would keep her tied to Brandon, something real to bind their unraveling love.


Eventually, both hopes had slipped away-she'd given up on Brandon, and with him, the idea of motherhood.



As days passed after finding out about her pregnancy and life quietly grew inside her, that certainty began to crumble, replaced by doubt and longing.


Now, as danger pressed closer, the thought of losing the child filled her with a sorrow she could hardly name.



The thought was unbearable.
That was her child, the extension of her own life.


That child had nothing to do with Brandon.


It was hers and hers alone.


Keeping the baby was all she wanted now.






Brandon pressed hard on the accelerator.


Tension radiated from the passenger seat, where Vivian gripped her seatbelt so tightly her knuck<les turned pale.


Not a word escaped her lips; silence was her safest choice after the show she'd put on earlier.


Still, Brandon's mood hovered over the car like a storm cloud.


She risked a sidelong glance at his profile, searching for any sign of weakness.


His expression was cold as ever, but the rigid jaw and clenched hands betrayed a swirling storm inside.
Millie still held a piece of his heart-that much was obvious, and Vivian seethed at the realization.


Dropping her gaze, Vivian slumped back, masking her calculations with a display of fragile exhaustion.


Crobert Hospital loomed into view much faster than she expected.


As soon as they stopped, Brandon threw his door open, barely pausing as he strode into the night.


Vivian scrambled out behind him, but halfway onto the pavement, she doubled over and spat a splash of "blood."



"Don't worry about me," she remnarked, dabbing at her lips and painting her words with practiced weakness. "I'm not long for this world anyway. Go on,Millie needs you."


Worry flickered across Brandon's face, his gaze torn between duty and compassion.


Without waiting for a reply, Vivian gently nudged him forward, playing up her own supposed sacrifice.
He didn't argue, only nodded, the lines of his mouth drawn tight. "I'll see how she's doing. You look after yourself."


"Alright," Vivian answered softly, eyes tracking him as he disappeared inside.


No sooner was he out of sight than her mask dropped-she whipped out her phone, scrolling for updates.


Brandon's steps echoed through the hospital lobby picking up speed with every stride until he was nearly running.


It dawned on him just how much fear still gripped him.





A nurse pointed him down the hall, and he rushed toward Millie's room, only to find his path blocked by Alexia's determined stance.



Tension spiked in his brow, eyes narrowed.


"How is she? Tell me the truth," he asked, voice low.
Alexia took her time answering, sizing him up with caution.


"What's going on here?" Brandon snapped, trying and failing to keep his temper in check.


Details from the policewoman's story replayed in Alexia's mind-doubts swirling, suspicions growing.Maybe Brandon had orchestrated everything just to get rid of Millie so he could finally be with Vivian?


That would likely explained his failure to answer any of the frantic calls from Millie's phone.


Words caught in Alexia's throat, unsure where to begin.




Watching Brandon grow more restless by the second, Alexia hesitated before speaking. "Brandon,is marrying Vivian so urgent that even waiting a single day feels like too much?"


Brandon turned to face her, a hint of confusion in his eyes. "What are you trying to say?" he asked.


Alexia hesitated, caught between distrust and worry.
While she stood there wavering, Brandon's impatience finally boiled over. "Get out of the way!"
###Chapter 17 Let Me See Her!
Alexia felt powerless, her hands clenching at her sides as she struggled to intervene. After wrestling with how to break the silence, she finally blurted out,"Did you have anything to do with what happened to Millie?"



Brandon shot her a look, suspicion flickering in his eyes. "What are you suggesting? You asked me to come here, didn't you?"


He sounded cold, as if something had just clicked for him. "Stop avoiding it. Tell me, how exactly is Millie doing?"


Frustration burned through Alexia, and she grabbed his arm, dragging him away from the others. "Listen,someone went after her on purpose-"


Suddenly, a voice interrupted her.


Vivian appeared in the hallway, breathless as she
hurried over.


The streaks of blood on her skin were gone, erased in case Alexia, a professional who knew her way around injuries, noticed anything odd.


Urgency colored Vivian's expression. "Is Millie okay?"


Alexia caught sight of Vivian and her irritation spiked.


"You brought her here, Brandon?" Alexia's finger jabbed toward Vivian, her tone sharp. "Did you think bringing her along would help Millie feel better?"


Not wanting a scene outside Millie's room, Alexia herded both of them toward the emergency exit.


Vivian shrank back, almost hiding behind Brandon,her voice small. "Dr. Hussain, you've got it wrong.I was just with Brandon when you called. Parking was a nightmare, and he didn't want to waste any time getting to Millie, so we just rushed in together."


Alexia scoffed inwardly at the explanation.


It was no secret that Millie loathed Vivian,
considering her nothing more than a shameless interloper. Even so, Vivian had tagged along, acting as if her presence was necessary.


There was nothing stopping her from waiting in the car or wandering off for a bit.


The whole thing was so absurd, Alexia let out a sharp, disbelieving laugh.


"Oh, that's right. I almost forgot. The two of you were spotted leaving the Watson Group together tonight in the same car, practically side by side." Alexia's voice dripped with sarcasm. "It's all over the Internet."


"You!" Vivian's eyes glistened, her face twisting with wounded outrage.


Brandon blocked her from Alexia's reach by the emergency exit, an act that made Alexia's skin crawl.


Their affection was no secret, splashed across gossip sites and social feeds, and now they brought the spectacle to the hospital halls.


Alexia wondered if Brandon had ever truly cared
about Millie, or if this was all just a show for Vivian's sake.


She blurted out, "If you two want to parade your relationship, do it somewhere else. I don't care for your drama."


Vivian only stared at the floor, silent and trying to look as though she'd been hurt.


Irritation clouded Brandon's face, and he spoke sharply. "That's enough. Why are you accusing her?What are you really getting at?"


"Millie was targeted on purpose. Someone hit her with a car," said Alexia, refusing to soften her words."I wouldn't put it past you to arrange it, just so you could move on with Vivian sooner."


Before Brandon could reply, Vivian slipped in between them. "Dr. Hussain, do you hear yourself?That's a heavy accusation."


Brushing off Alexia's suspicion, Vivian asked,"Accidents happen, and Millie could have been hit by
anyone. How can you turn on Brandon without proof?"





She sounded completely convinced of her own innocence as she continued, "It was you who asked Brandon to come. We've been here for a while now,but you're still keeping us from seeing Millie. What's the real reason? Is she perfectly fine, and you're just making things up?"


That was all it took for Alexia's anger to reach its limit. She could still picture Millie as she was wheeled in,pale and fragile.


The memory of the risks Millie faced haunted Alexia.


With Millie's rare Rh-negative blood type, even a minor injury could become deadly, never mind being pregnant with Brandon's child.


Vivian's attempt to twist the truth was beyond infuriating.


Alexia raised her voice. "Are you trying to pin this on everyone else, Vivian, because you're the one behindthe wheel?"


"You!" For a moment, Vivian's bravado faltered, her eyes flashing with fear before she put on that hurt look again.


Brandon stood in front of Vivian, his tone icy as he spoke. "Starting at 8:45 PM, paparazzi have been following Vivian after she walked out of her studio.Her every move has been plastered all over the Internet. And she's been with me the entire time since she arrived at the Watson Group."


Alexia's jaw tightened. "That doesn't prove anything.She could've sent someone else to do her dirty work."



Frustration carved lines into Brandon's face. "You're crossing a line, Alexia," he snapped, anger sparking in his eyes.







Deep inside the hospital room, Millie found herself swallowed by pitch-black silence.That emptiness wrapped around her like cold fog,pulling her under.


Something vital had slipped from her memory.


Fear coiled in her chest as she reached for a lifeline she couldn't grasp.


Her body felt like lead, and she couldn't will it to move.





Time stretched endlessly-until a faint glow appeared ahead.



Summoning what little energy remained, she inched toward it.



The light revealed a peaceful family moment inside a modest villa, with a soft white wool carpet beneath their feet and a sleek black grand piano standing proudly at the center.


A little girl sat at the piano bench, pressing keys in irregular rhythm.


The melody floating from the piano was "For Alice."Curtains fluttered in the breeze through an old-fashioned window frame.



Warm yellow sunlight spilled into the room,illuminating its timeless pastoral decor.


Everything in that moment seemed stunning and serene.



After awkwardly repeating the piece a few times, the.girl pounded the keys in frustration.


Right at that moment, a kind-faced, attractive man walked over to her.



He spoke in a voice that seemed to carry comfort from another era. "Millie, remember to be patient whenever you try something new."


The young girl stuck out her lower lip, and sadness filled her wide eyes.


With a dramatic frown, she said, "Dad, I have been practicing for more than a week, but I still can't play it the right way. It's really difficult for me."A gentle smile spread across the man's face. He reached out to softly mess up her hair, and then took a seat on the piano bench beside his daughter,playing a piece for her to hear.


It was "For Alice."



He kept his gaze on her while playing, and then said,"Millie, look. Your dad can play it, right? Since you are my daughter, I know you can do it to0."


Her eyes lit up with awe. "Wow, Dad! When did you learn how to play this?"


With a light laugh, he took her hand in his own. He patiently guided her fingers to the keys, and at first her hands stumbled, but soon enough, the melody started to come together as they played together.


"I just picked it up not long ago," he said with encouragement. "Because you are learning the piano, I wanted to learn it as well."


She focused on the keys, her face serious, and spoke with real admiration. "Dad, you're incredible!"He shook his head and grinned. "You're the real star,Millie." He slowly let go of her hand and watched her continue to play smoothly, even though she didn't notice he was no longer helping. "All you need is a little faith in yourself."


When his hand slipped away completely, he said,"You're my only child, and everything I have belongs to you. Ever since you were born, I knewv you would someday become the next leader of the Bennett family."


She looked up at him, her voice filled with doubt."Dad, is that something I can really do?"


He answered with a warm smile, "You definitely can."


The sound of the piano drifted through the air, gentle as a soft breeze, while the man's eyes shone with pride and affection for his daughter.


He looked at her and said, "Look at you now-you've made it,haven't you?"
###Chapter 18 Looks Like You're Perfectly Fine
Wonder swept across the girl's face as she stared at her hands, her fingers gliding over the keys and filling the room with sweet music.



A bright smile appeared on her face. "Dad, I actually did it!" she said, joy ringing in her voice.


He answered with a proud nod and a gentle smile.After that, he turned his attention to the woman who leaned gracefully against the grand piano, her chin resting in her palm as she watched father and daughter with a look full of warmth.


Her beauty was impossible to ignore. She wore a bold red dress, and her long curls tumbled over her shoulders in lazy waves, giving her a captivating presence.


A soft pat on the girl's shoulder signaled the man'snext move. He strode over to the woman.



With one hand tucked behind his back and his body bent in a polite bow, he extended his hand, inviting her to join him. "Would you dance with me,sweetheart?"



Her eyes sparkled as she slipped her hand into his."I'd love to," she replied, her voice gentle and bright.


Music from the piano filled the space, rising with energy as the man spun the woman around. Her red dress fanned out, the moment captured like a painting in memory.


Meanwhile, the little girl continued playing, each note chosen with care and happiness.



Another breeze swept through, and she glanced up,watching the light curtain billow softly in the moving air.



Beyond the glass, she spotted a young boy on the balcony of the neighboring villa, dressed in a cream polo,quietly observing the scene inside.His hair was tousled across his forehead, and his eyes, deep and steady, held a keen sharpness.


Moments slipped away, and Millie watched the boy's youthful features fade, gradually blending into the more serious and composed look of Brandon as an adult-someone marked by quiet strength and hidden edges.


A shrill sound broke the spell. "Beep, beep, beep...".


Millie's eyes snapped open inside the hospital room.


Everything swirled before her, and the white ceiling spun above her head.


A wave of nausea roled over her, sudden and strong.


The sharp smell of antiseptic filled her nose, and pain throbbed along her temples.


Millie realized she was lying in a hospital bed, the sensation so unsteady it felt like she was adrift at sea.


The images from her dream flickered in her mind.She saw her parents sharing a dance from years past.





Young Brandon's steady gaze also kept appearing,as if he lived inside her memories.



Without making a sound, tears slipped down Millie's cheeks. She could not tell if it was the pain in her body or the weight of old memories that brought them on.



Someone from the hallway shouted, "So now you're desperate to shift the blame because you were the one who hit her?"



Another voice rang out. "Alexia, that's enough.Don't push it."



Raised voices drifted in from the hallway, making Millie knit her brow in discomfort.


She could easily tell it was Alexia and Brandon arguing.





A fight had broken out between them.Confusion filled her thoughts.


Millie tried to push herself upright, but her head kept spinning.


She pressed her palms to the mattress and peered at the sign next to her hospital bed.


Only at that moment did she understand that she was suffering from a concussion.


Her hand went to the bandage on her forehead.That brought back the memory of how she had gotten hurt.



Right away, she moved her hand to her stomach.


There was still a dull ache lingering there.


She wondered if her baby was safe.


No answer came to her.



A voice outside spoke again. "So you're really going to pick a fight with me for her sake?"


The argument grew even louder in the hallway.Alexia's voice sounded shrill, as if she was the one being wronged.


Forcing herself to sit up, Millie slipped her feet into a pair of flat slippers, and then leaned on the wall as she slowly shuffled toward the door.


When she stepped outside, she saw three people standing close to the emergency exit-Brandon,Alexia, and Vivian.


Brandon wore the same clothes from that morning,while Vivian had changed into a cream suit that looked expensive.


The two of them appeared caught up in something with Alexia, who had on a white lab coat, but Millie could not make sense of what was going on.


Afraid that Alexia might be picked on, Millie spoke up right away. "What are you doing!"


"Millie!" Alexia reacted the quickest, rushing forward to steady Millie.


Standing with Vivian,Brandon narrowed his eyes ashe studied Millie from head to toe, stopping to focus on the bandage across her forehead.


Millie wasted no time asking, "What happened?"


Before Alexia could answer, Brandon interrupted, his tone cold and sharp.


His words were edged with sarcasm as he addressed Millie. "Looks like you're perfectly fine."


Millie's pale face and the simple bandage over her forehead wound only fueled Brandon's anger.


He wondered if the whole situation had been staged by Millie and Alexia.


Did Millie fake the accident just to make him leave Vivian and come here?


He could still hear the phone ringing in the car,remember how Vivian had coughed up blood with a look full of guilt. Those memories only made Brandon's anger burn hotter.


Now it made sense why Alexia had tried so hard to
keep him from seeing Millie ever since he arrived.


He told himself he never should have trusted Alexia's story.


Frustration showed on his face as the veins in his neck stood out, and he turned away.


All the worry and care he had felt seemed pointless now.



Millie was confused by his words; she had just come to her senses, and the fog from her concussion left her feeling sick.


Alexia spoke up, her voice rising. "Fine? Can't you see Millie's got a head injury? Did you just ignore everything I told you before?"


Vivian responded sharply, "It's just a little bandage,isn't it?"


Alexia exclaimed, "Vivian!"


Vivian straightened, standing her ground for Brandon. "Millie, you kept calling Brandon again andagain while he was still driving, and then you told Alexia to call and chew him out, demanding that he come here, all for something so minor? Are you even aware how dangerous it was, how busy the roads were? Alexia, your call made me think Millie was dying! Listen, I may not have much time left, but I'm not going to let you two make things harder for Brandon!"


Vivian spoke with a voice that carried strength and unwavering resolve. She stepped away from Brandon, her body shaking a little, but she stood tall and fearless, as if she would take on anyone to defend him.


Brandon stayed silent, his gaze hard and unyielding as he looked at Millie. The impatience and contempt in his eyes were impossible to miss.


Alexia finally lost her patience. "Vivian, you're talking nonsense! I won't let you get away with this!" She charged forward, aiming a slap at Vivian's mouth.


Vivian made no move to avoid it, ready to strike back if she had to.
Brandon threw out his arm to break them apart, and Millie, lost and unsure, quickly grabbed Alexia, afraid things would spiral out of control.


The area just outside the emergency exit dissolved into complete chaos.



Alexia and Vivian became the heart of the fight.Alexia was wild with anger, while Vivian looked ready for battle, her eyes darting over to Millie every so often.



Both of them fought with everything they had.


Alexia shouted, "Vivian, how dare you pinch me!"


A loud slap rang out in the hallway.


Vivian cried out, "Alexia, you actually hit me in the face!"



Millie and Brandon did everything they could to separate them, but it became impossible to tell whose arms or hands belonged to whom as all four became tangled together.
The scuffle spilled from the emergency exit and into the stairwell, their shouting and cries echoing through the walls.


Suddenly, a sharp look flickered in Vivian's eyes.


In one swift move, she slammed her forehead into Alexia's, all while pretending to accidentally shove Brandon's hand aside.


Without warning, Millie, who was still holding onto Alexia, felt a powerful force pressing into her waist.


A split second later, she realized she was no longer behind the others but right at the side of the stairs.


Her mind raced. She was still pregnant, and standing at the top of the stairs, she knew a fall could be dangerous.


No-she could not let that happen.


Before she knew it, Millie twisted her body,forcing herself to grab the railing and steady herself as quickly as she could.
###Chapter 19 The Sadness Inside Grew So Heavy

The fall happened so quickly, Millie barely had time to react. Her nails scraped along the wooden railings,leaving deep marks before she finally lost her grip and tumbled down the stairs.


Both arms wrapped tightly around her stomach, she did all she could to protect her baby.


The entire accident unfolded in just a heartbeat.


At the stairway landing, Vivian and Alexia collided,their heads knocking together before they both crashed to the floor.


Brandon's hands moved through the chaos. He felt like he had pushed something and in the next moment, he saw Millie tumbling down the stairs.


He tried to grab her, but his fingers closed around nothing but air.
The stairwell was poorly lit, and once there was no movement, the sensor lights clicked off, leaving only the greenish glow of the "Emergency Exit" sign to light up the scene.


With effort, Millie pushed herself up and lifted her head,catching sight of Brandon's outstretched hand.


It dawned on her-he was the one who pushed her.


Alexia's voice broke the silence, trembling with fear.


"Millie!" she cried out, which brought the sensor lights flickering back on.


Pushing Vivian out of the way, Alexia hurried down to where Millie had fallen.


Her hands shook as she helped Millie up. "Millie, are you hurt?" she asked, her voice thick with tears.


Sweat poured down Millie's face, and her body throbbed with pain-her head, hands, and feet all aching from the fall.


Yet all those bruises faded in comparison to the painburning in her lower belly, a pain so sharp she almost blacked out.



"Millie..." Alexia called her name again, panic rising in her voice. She understood just how serious Millie's condition was.


Earlier, when Millie had been wheeled out of surgery,a doctor had pulled Alexia aside and explained the injuries. "She hit her head during the car crash,which left her with scrapes and a mild concussion.There's some vaginal bleeding. The baby hasn't been lost yet, but this is very risky. She'll have to stay on bed rest if she wants to keep the pregnancy."


The doctor also shared that Millie kept begging them to save the baby while she was being treated.


Now Millie had fallen down an entire flight of stairs-just to stop her from fighting Vivian.


Guilt crashed over Alexia, and tears poured down her cheeks.


With shaky hands, Alexia fumbled for her phone andpunched in a number.


"Millie, I'm calling for help. Please hold on," she pleaded.





Pain robbed Millie of her voice, leaving her unable to say a word.


She could feel something precious slipping away, a sense of loss deep inside her.


Despite the pain, Millie lifted her head and saw Brandon moving toward Vivian to help her up.


She parted her lips, hoping to call out to him,but not a single sound escaped.


All she could do was watch as Brandon wrapped his arms around Vivian, his touch gentle and full of care.


The sensor lights were off again, and only the dim glow from the hallway beyond the doors sketched the outline of Brandon and Vivian standing side by side.


Tears streamed down Millie's face, her heart gripped
by a pain she could not control.


"Brandon..." Millie finally managed to whisper as he was guiding Vivian away from the exit.


He hesitated, pausing for a moment, but never turned to look at her. His eyes remained fixed on the white hallway beyond the doors.


Night had already fallen, and the hallway was empty,、filled with silence.



Brandon's heart was anything but calm.


Back when chaos broke out, he had seen Millie go down the stairs. What haunted him now was the thought that he might have been the one who had pushed her.


His fists clenched so tightly that his nails dug into his palms, his whole body shaking from how hard he was gripping them.


Right beside him, Vivian spoke his name in a gentle voice. "Brandon," she said softly.
He glanced down and took in the sight of Vivian's face, her cheek swollen and bruised, a fresh bump rising on her forehead from their earlier fight.


A moment passed as he shut his eyes.


Once he opened them, he spoke in an even tone."That's it, Millie."


Without another word, he took Vivian by the hand and guided her through the emergency exit.


A cry rang out behind them, Alexia's voice raw with pain."Brandon!"


He kept moving and never looked back.


Inside the stairwell, Millie could only watch as Brandon walked away.


As they walked through the doors, Vivian shot a look over her shoulder, her eyes glinting with victory and a hint of mockery.


Unable to bear it, Millie closed her eyes and let the tears fall.
The truth was, she had lost everything a long time ago.


Why had she called for him again?


She should have already seen this coming.


Was it because she couldn't let go? Or was it because he was the father of her baby?


She had promised herself she would never let her heart waver again. So why couldn't she keep that promise?


Tears continued to stream down her cheeks, and the pain in her stomach grew worse.


The sadness inside her grew so heavy, it felt as if it might swallow her whole.


A single word escaped her lips, quiet and desperate."Alexia..." Millie did not know what else to do, only that she needed Alexia near.


Alexia was already sobbing, her hands busy wiping at Millie's face, but her tears kept falling, making itimpossible to dry them all.


"Millie, this is all because of me," Alexia cried out,pulling Millie into a tight embrace. "I'm so sorry,Millie. I really am... so sorry."


Millie's pain was so intense that her thoughts began to blur and fade.



Images from her dream seemed to flash in front of her, her father twirling her mother in a bright red dress, the younger face of Brandon watching everything from his balcony.


She could hardly bear it and silently begged in her heart. "Dad, Mom,what should I do now?"


Her body shook with sobs until there was nothing left to give.


As she slipped toward unconsciousness, her hand reached out, tryingto hold on to something. But in the end, her fingers only grasped at empty air.


"Millie!" Alexia screamed, her voice breaking as she watched Millie's hand slip from view.Suddenly, the lights in the stairwell grew brighter,shining down on a wide pool of blood spreading beneath Millie, soaking both her clothes and Alexia's white lab coat.


Alexia was paralyzed by fear, unable to do anything except call out for the doctors again and again,begging them to hurry.


Doctors rushed in a moment later, gently moving.Millie onto a gurney and carrying her quickly toward the emergency room.


"She's going to be okay. We'll get her through this,"said a colleague who often got along with Alexia,giving her shoulder a gentle pat for comfort before rushing off.


Alexia remained still, her eyes fixed in a daze on the bloodstained ground.


She did not move until the cleaners arrived and began to tidy the area. That was when she wiped her tears away and hurried after the doctors toward the emergency room.
Elsewhere, Brandon slipped into the car with Vivian.


The door clicked shut and he buckled his seatbelt,but his hand hovered over the ignition. He did not start the engine.


Images of Millie's eyes as she fell down the stairs kept replaying in his mind.


From the passenger seat, Vivian's voice broke the silence. "Brandon, if you're still worried about her,you can go back. We're parked in the hospital lot,and if you just go upstairs, you'll find her. I don't mind going home by myself."


He said nothing, fingers gripping the steering wheel so tightly his knuckles went pale.


Vivian dropped her gaze and rummaged in her bag for a wet wipe. Carefully, she cleaned her lips, wiping away both her lipstick and the smudge of fresh blood left behind by Alexia's slap.


She left the stained wipe right in Brandon's line of
sight, letting him see the red and pink marks as she sighed. "I shouldn't have lost control and gotten into a fight with Dr. Hussain here at the hospital. I never touched Millie, but somehow she did fall during our fight..."


Vivian leaned closer and wrapped her hand around Brandon's, tears glistening in her eyes. "I'm sorry,Brandon. I only wanted to protect you."


Brandon's gaze dropped to the hand Vivian had placed over his.


A strange feeling swept through him as an old memory surfaced-years ago, when he was overwhelmed by worry and pain during his grandfather's illness, it was Millie who took his hand like this and softly comforted him.
###Chapter 20 You Never Stood A Chance,Millie!
Brandon could still picture that day-him kneeling on one knee, his head pressed to Millie's shoulder.The always composed Brandon Watson had fallen apart,tears slipping down his cheeks and soaking her shirt.


Millie's hand moved gently through his hair, and she softly patted his back, offering quiet comfort as he broke down.



That day, she whispered words meant to calm him,"Brandon, don't be scared. Your family thinks that our marriage could lift Derek's spirits and maybe help him feel better. I'll go home with you. Even if Derek... Brandon, you're not alone. I'll be here."


Her unique scent seemed to linger with him even now, the only brightness during such a dark time in his life.He kept hearing her say his name-sometimes happy,sometimes sad, sometimes gentle or shy. That voice seemed to echo again and again in his mind.


The very last time was only a moment ago, when she called out to him from the bottom of the stairs.


Suddenly, a cold worry twisted inside him, making his brow tighten.


Just then, Vivian's voice broke through his thoughts.She squeezed his hand and asked, "Brandon, what's wrong?"



Brandon glanced up and saw Vivian looking pale and fragile, sitting right beside him.


That snappedhim back to reality.


He turned away, eyes closing for a moment to steady himself.


"It's nothing," he finally answered, pulling his hand from hers and starting the car. "Alexia's with Millie at the hospital. She'll take care of her."With a calm face, he focused on the road ahead and skillfully drove the Aston Martin out of the lot and onto the main road. "I'll get you home."


She offered a faint smile. "Alright."






Meanwhile, the hospital corridor outside the emergency room buzzed with doctors and nurses.hurrying in and out.


Alexia stood just outside, nerves stretched tight as she waited for news.



Even though she was a gynecologist and had performed countless surgeries, her emotions overwhelmed her now, leaving her unable to step inside.



Thankfully, she had made sure that blood supplies would be available ahead of time.


Still, Alexia could not be certain about Millie's condition right now.With the fall and so much blood lost, she wondered if there was any hope left for the baby.


Her thoughts spun in circles, and she realized she could not even trust her own judgment at the moment. All she could do was wait and hope for good news.


The sound of hurried footsteps drew near, making Alexia look up. Her brother, Giffard Hussain,appeared in the hallway.


The sight of him made Alexia run straight into his arms. "Giffard!" she cried, letting her newly steadied nerves crumble again.


She wept openly in his embrace. "Giffard, I've put Millie in danger. What am I supposed to do?"


He let out a soft sigh and gently patted her back. "I heard what happened while I was on my way here.Don't worry. Let me go in and take a look. If you can't trust anyone else, you know you can count on me,right?"The Hussain family were a well-known family in the medical world, and Giffard, as the family's firstborn,had built a reputation as a talented doctor.


Even though gynecology was not his specialty, he was skilled in a wide range of medical fields.


"Alright, alright," Alexia said quickly, scrambling to her feet and drying her eyes. "Please hurry, Giffard!"


He smiled gently, brushing away the last of her tears before changing into scrubs and carefully disinfecting his hands, and then heading into the emergency room.


No sooner had he stepped inside than alarms began to ring out from the monitors.


"Her heart rate is falling fast-get the defibrillator ready! Find out if her family is outside-we need a signature on the critical care consent form!"


A wave of panic swept through the emergency room.Meanwhile, the Aston Martin glided to a stop at the entrance of Vivian's apartment complex.


Inside the car, Vivian quietly studied Brandon's face,watching him out of the corner of her eye.


Brandon always knew how to keep his feelings hidden, never revealing any hint of happiness or frustration.


In the world of business, even his toughest competitors, backed by the best teams, struggled to guess what he was thinking.


When Watson Group faced its most challenging period, Brandon stepped up and made evey major decision.



He drove the company to pivot from its traditional business model and pushed it into the tech industry,leading Watson Group all the way to the top and making it a leader in the field. Brandon's talent had always been proven by action, not just words.


Vivian never believed she could have completecontrol over Brandon. She only wanted to outshine Millie, and that would be enough.


Right now, that seemed possible. Millie was still at the hospital, and Vivian sat in the passenger seat of Brandon's luxury car. She believed that was a win already.


When Brandon tapped his fingers lightly against the steering wheel and didn't move to get out, Vivian.spoke up. "We're here."


"Alright," Brandon answered, but he still made no move to leave the car.


Vivian hesitated for a moment before asking, her voice soft and unsure, "Brandon, aren't you going to walk me upstairs?"


Her invitation was clear.



She was asking him into her home, no extra words needed.


He stopped drumming his fingers and looked straight at Vivian.For a moment, he just studied her face without saying a word.


Vivian's heart began to beat faster.


After a few seconds, Brandon replied,"I'm a little tired tonight."


Vivian gave a gentle nod, choosing not to push further.





An awkward silence stretched between them.



Brandon finally spoke. "Go inside and get some rest."


"Alright," Vivian remarked, her voice quiet.


At last, Brandon walked Vivian to the elevator.


The doors closed and the elevator carried her up to her floor.



Once she arrived, she stood by the window, watching as Brandon made his way back to his car. The hint of victory in her eyes was unmistakable.


Her thoughts drifted back to what she had doneearlier when she first learned about Millie's pregnancy.


Four hours earlier, at eight in the evening, Vivian was inside her studio.



She stood up so suddenly upon reading the message that she startled the caregiver nearby, who could not figure out why Vivian, who had been so pleased with herself seconds ago, was suddenly so unsettled.


The caregiver dared not speak, simply watched as Vivian, deep in thought, took out her phone and made a call.



Her voice was steady as she spoke. "Yes, it's me,Vivian. I need a favor. Don't ask me why. If you care about me, just do as I say. Yes, I'm with Brandon now.Does that really matter? You told me you loved me,didn't you? If that's true, prove it. Help me with this."


Vivian ended the call, and her eyes burned with cold resolve.


She knew that Brandon had always loved children. All this time together had taught her as much.


Brandon and Milliewere nearly finished with their divorce, just a few more steps to go.


If Brandon found out about Millie's pregnancy,he might call the whole thing off.


Vivian had done everything she could to bring things to this point. She could not allow anything to ruin it now.



Her phone vibrated just then.



Two new messages appeared on her screen.


One was from the person she just called. "Alright, I promise. I'll take care of it for you."


The other message came from Brandon,replying to her earlier text about meeting him after work. All he said was a simple, "Okay."


At exactly 8:45 PM, she walked out of her studio, and the paparazzi she had secretly tipped off were already snapping photos of her every move.Every headline and every social media post that followed was carefully planned by her.


As the Aston Martin disappeared from sight, Vivian let out a quiet laugh and whispered to herself, "You really think you can keep him with a baby? I won't let that happen. Three days from now, when the premiere for Heavenly Melody goes live, it will be the start of your downfall. Everything you have will slip away, and I will take your place. You never stood a chance,Millie!"






At Crobert Hospital, Alexia continued to wait in the hallway outside the emergency room, time dragging by.


Finally, she heard movement on the other side of the doors. The moment they swung open, Alexia sprang to her feet.
 ###Chapter 21 Let Go Of Millie





Behind the wheel, Brandon drove through the night,listening to the wind rattle the trees outside his window.



Earlier that evening, the weather forecast had warned of strong gusts.


Shadows from the trees twisted beneath the faint glow of the streetlights, making the road look strange and unfamiliar.


The digital clock on the dashboard ticked from 11:59to midnight.


All at once, Brandon slammed on the brakes.


He paused for just a second, and then spun the car around and sped back toward the hospital.


The highway was nearly deserted in the early hours,and his Aston Martin tore down the lane, the engineroaring.


Finally, he hit the brakes again, pulling to a stop right under the hospital's bright lights.


Brandon glanced up at the windows glowing against the darkness, his mouth drawn tight with worry.



Pulling out his phone, he searched for Millie's number and pressed call.


"Beep beep,beep beep..."


No one picked up.


He called again, still nothing.


Switching tactics, Brandon decided to call Alexia instead, his thumb hovering over the screen.


That was when he saw the missed call from Alexia while he was driving Vivian home-one he had ignored at the time.


With a furrowed brow, he pressed the call button for Alexia.The phone rang, but once again, no one picked up.


He stared at the screen for a long moment, trying to put together a message to send.



But...



As he typed, Brandon faltered.


How could he find the right words?


Just then, someone tapped on the car window.


Startled, Brandon looked up to see Giffard standing there, dressed in his white lab coat.


Brandon pressed the window button, a faint frown settling on his face.



Giffard stood outside, holding up a phone. "If you really want to know how Millie is, go upstairs and see for yourself. Stop blowing up our phones."


Brandon's gaze narrowed. "I'm her husband."



A smirk played across Giffard's lips."So you finally remember you're her husband." He paused, and then added, "But from what Alexia told me, that won't be true for much longer."


Brandon's grip on the steering wheel tightened, his eyes fixed on Giffard's taunting expression. "That has nothing to do with you."


"It has everything to do with me now." Giffard leaned closer to the open window, his words teasing but.with a sharp edge. "Alexia said since her fight led to you pushing Millie down the stairs and now she's injured, I'm supposed to make it up to Millie on the family's behalf."


He gave a short laugh. "I think that's only fair."


A vein pulsed in Brandon's clenched fist. "Giffard!"


Giffard stood there in silence, simply watching him.


After several moments, Brandon asked, "Did Millie send you here to say all this?"


Had Millie given up on Alexia and now sent Giffard to play her next hand?Was this all part of her latest scheme?


Giffard's smile faded, and his cold stare bore into Brandon. "Does that make you mad? You ought to know, Brandon, Crobert isn't a place where you're the only man around. I've watched Millie grow up.I know how captivating she is, probably better than you do. If you're set on being with Vivian, then stay with her. What happens to Millie is no longer your concern."



His voice stayed even and calm.


"Brandon," Giffard continued, slow and measured.

"The only real choice you have now is to let her go."


Back when the crisis struck and they needed a signature for the critical care consent form, a nurse went searching for Millie's family outside the ER-but only Alexia had been waiting there.


Millie's father had passed away, and her mother had.long since drifted out of her life. That meant the only person they could track down was her husband,Brandon. Yet, Brandon was the very one who hadpushed Millie down the stairs and walked out with another woman.



Even knowing this, Alexia still tried calling him, but he never picked up.


In the end, Alexia explained the seriousness of the situation and, using her influence as the hospital director's daughter, signed the critical care consent form herself, planning to get the proper paperwork later.



Giffard saw the frustration tighten Brandon's features, and a hint of a sneer tugged at his lips.


He had already given Brandon a chance.


If Brandon had come into the hospital to ask about Millie, Giffard might havé thought there was some decency left in him.


But Brandon stayed away.


That actually made everything simple and clear.


Giffard watched as Brandon rolled up his window anddrove off without looking back, his own expression giving nothing away.


The midnight breeze tugged at the edge of Giffard's white coat as he watched the Aston Martin vanish around the corner. He shook his head and let out a quiet sigh.







When Millie finally opened her eyes, morning sunlight spilled into the room.


Soft rays of gold streamed through the window,bathing everything in gentle light.


"Millie, you're awake!" Alexia called out.


Still groggy, Millie saw Alexia and Charles by her bedside, both wearing anxious expressions. The ache in her body brought every painful memory rushing back.



She tried to speak, but only managed a single word."1....The pain, along with the memory of all that blood before she passed out, filled her with dread.


Alexia reached out and gently helped Millie sit up, her own eyes full of sorrow. "Millie, the baby didn't make it," she said softly.


Millie parted her lips to respond, but then stopped,saying nothing at all.


After half a minute of silence, she bowed her head and finally whispered, "Okay."


Her voice was flat. No anger, no tears, not even surprise.



Just a quiet acceptance.



Alexia and Charles shared a look of concern. At last,Charles stepped closer to Millie and spoke. "Millie,you need to give yourself time to heal. It's fortunate that you didn't break any bones when you fell, but you still have soft tissue injuries, and your concussion isn't better yet-not to mention the miscarriage..."His voice turned gentle, as though he feared speaking too sharply might cause Millie to slip away entirely.


He continued, "I'll sign you off for the show Heavenly Melody for now, and after you recover-"


Millie interrupted before he could finish. "I want to be on the show."


Under the blanket, her hands balled into fists,fingernails pressing so hard into her palms that they drew blood.


That pain was sharp, but it reminded her she was still alive.



With her back against the headboard, Millie kept her face blank and unreadablé.


She lifted her eyes to Charles. "I can handle it."


Charles hesitated. "But the first live show is in just three days," he said. "Your health-"


"I can handle it," Millie remarked again, her tone as calm as ever, no sign of emotion in her voice.


Her hands shook beneath the covers from how tightly she held them.


Charles looked at Alexia, who gave a tiny nod.


After a moment's pause, he gave in. "Alright, Millie."


Those words made Millie drop her gaze and loosen her fists at last.



"Thank you," she murmured.


Charles gave a quiet shake of his head. "There's no need to thank me. Your presence at the show benefits us both."



He knew that if Millie performed anywhere near her usual level, she would be more than capable of handling everything.


Since the first live broadcast was only an introductory show, MAillie's participation wouldn't cause any problems. Contestants would not be eliminated until the next round. Charles' real concern was for her well-being.



Millie lifted her chin and tried to smile.



That smile was meant to reassure them that she was fine. But everyone in the room saw right through it.


Knowing she could not maintain that facade, MAillie spoke up again. "Charles, I might not be able to get my costumes or find a makeup artist on my own right now. Could you handle that for me?"


Charles answered with a nod, "That's actually part of what the company does."


"Could you start making arrangements right away?"she asked again.


For a moment, Charles hesitated, searching for the right words.


Millie shifted her gaze to Alexia. "Alexia, I'm feeling a little hungry. Would you mind getting me something to eat?"



Alexia parted her lips as if to speak, but only managed a sad look in Millie's direction.


Millie offered them both another small smile."Please?"





Her voice softened with a trace of longing.


Charles and Alexia exchanged another look and silently agreed.


Together, they left the room, quietly closing the door.behind them.



As soon as they were gone, silence took over.


Millie's smile disappeared, the forced curve of her lips slipping away until her face was expressionless.


April's lingering chill made her shiver, and she slid beneath the covers, searching for warmth and a bit of comfort.


Millie pulled the covers over herself, craving the shelter and comfort they offered against the harshness of the world outside.


Unable to hold back any longer, she sank into quiet sobs, pressing her fists to her mouth and biting down until the pain drew blood.
###Chapter 22 Now He Was Alone




Tears streamed down Millie's cheeks in an endless cascade, each drop carrying the weight of her shattered dreams.


Why did everything she desperately wanted to protect always slip through her grasp?


Her father, her husband, the Bennett family legacy,and now... her precious baby had been torn away too.


Nothing remained within her reach, no matter how fiercely she fought to keep it close.


She had exhausted every possible method to preserve what mattered most, but like fine sand escaping through her clenched fingers, everything dissolved into nothingness despite her desperate grip.


The overwhelming sense of powerlessness crushed her spirit.

Millie pressed her palm against her empty belly, her hand slowly curling into a determined fist.


She realized with bitter clarity that she remained too weak,too vulnerable.


She couldn't linger beside anyone as a temporary comfort, nor could she depend on another soul to become her salvation.



The path forward demanded everything she had left to give.


Her career beckoned-she needed to seize control of it with unwavering determination.


The Bennett family legacy-she had to breathe new life into its crumbling foundation.


The mysterious circumstances surrounding her father's death-she needed to drag every hidden truth into the light.


And her relationship with her mother...


She had to pour every ounce of her being into this

fight, so the crushing pain would finally lose its grip on her heart.


Millie wept until her tears ran dry, until her body had nothing left to give.


The sharp edges of her anguish seemed to dissolve,leaving behind a strange, hollow numbness that settled over her like a protective shield.


No overwhelming joy, no crushing despair-perhaps this emotional void wasn't such a terrible thing after all.



This realization sparked something resembling hope within her chest, convincing her that moving forward was still possible.


When Alexia and Charles pushed through the door,Millie had already gathered the scattered pieces of herself back together, her mask firmly in place.


"Here, Millie, I brought you some nourishing chicken soup," Alexia said, her voice carrying genuine warmth as she twisted open the thermos cap. "Please try it
and tell me what you think."


Millie accepted the container, breathing in the rich,comforting aroma that rose from the steaming contents.


Under Alexia's hopeful gaze, she lifted the spoon to her lips and savored the first taste, allowing the flavors to dance across her tongue.


"This tastes absolutely wonderful," Millie murmured,surprised by the genuine appreciation in her voice.


"If the flavor pleases you, please have as much as you want," Alexia responded, studying Millie's pallid complexion with concerned eyes. "Focus on getting your strength back."


Millie nodded with newfound resolve blazing in her eyes.


Recovery was no longer a distant dream-it was her immediate mission.


Charles settled into his chair and began sharing the crucial information he had just uncovered during his
conversations with his team.



As their conversation flowed naturally between the three of them, on the other side of the city...


Brandon's eyes fluttered open as he lay sprawled across the leather sofa, his body stiff from an uncomfortable night.


His suit jacket served as his makeshift blanket, while the glass ashtray on the coffee table overflowed with the remnants of countless cigarettes.


This sterile apartment near his company headquarters had become his refuge during particularly demanding work periods, though after exchanging vows with Millie, he had rarely needed this temporary sanctuary.,


The pounding headache that greeted his consciousness made him wince as he struggled to focus, his hand instinctively reaching for the phone that lay beside him on the cushions.


He scrolled through the endless stream of messages
cluttering his phone screen, his thumb moving with practiced efficiency as he bypassed countless notifications until his eyes locked onto Millie's chat thread.



The digital exchange remained painfully one-sided,displaying only his earlier curt message. "I told my grandfather yesterday you weren't feeling well, so you couldn't come. This weekend, you'll be going with me to visit them."



A shadow of irritation crossed his features as he cast the device aside with casual indiffeence.


Brandon pushed himself upright, his fingers working small circles against his throbbing temples before he rose to his feet, the cool hardwood floor meeting his bare soles as he padded toward the bathroom.


The chrome faucet responded to his touch with a rush of icy water, which he cupped in his palms and splashed against his face in desperate attempts to banish the fog clouding his thoughts.


Yet without warning, his consciousness betrayed him
by conjuring memories from years past, when he had endured similar sleepless marathons during the company's most challenging periods, his body wracked with identical bone-deep fatigue.


During those grueling times, Millie had remained steadfast at his side, weathering every storm alongside him, her hands equally stained with the ink of contracts and her eyes equally strained from endless strategy sessions as they witnessed the company's remarkable metamorphosis together.


One particular morning surfaced in his consciousness with startling clarity-he had stood in this exact position, splashing frigid water against his weary face while Millie lingered nearby, a pristine towel folded neatly in her caring hands.


When he had turned to face her, she had approached with the gentle care one might show a beloved pet dabbing away the water droplets with tender precision before playfully ruffling his dampened hair.


His instinctive frown had prompted him to reach for the towel, but she had intercepted his movement, her
fingertips beginning a soothing massage against his aching temples.


"Does this bring you some relief?" Her voice had carried the softness of silk as it drifted through the air.



The melodic quality of her words had possessed an almost magical ability to ease the tension that had coiled like a spring within his chest.


"Today should finally yield the results we've been working toward, shouldn't it?" She had continued with unwavering optimism. "Brandon, what would you like to eat tonight? I'll prepare whatever your heart desires."



Despite having sampled the most exquisite cuisines from renowned establishments across the globe during business dinners and social obligations,nothing had ever compared to the simple,unpretentious meals she had crafted in their modest kitchen-each dish infused with warmth that no expensive delicacy could ever provide.
That particular day, before he could voice his culinary preference, the shrill ring of his phone had shattered the intimate moment between them.


The news that followed had exceeded his wildest expectations, surpassing even the most optimistic scenarios he had dared to imagine.


He had ended the call with trembling hands, spun around to face her, and swept her into his arms.before lifting her off the floor in a spontaneous celebration dance right there beside the running sink.



His sudden burst of euphoria had caught her completely off guard, leaving her with wide,startled eyes when he had finally lowered her back to the tile floor.



Her expression of pure surprise had been absolutely enchanting.


A low chuckle had escaped his throat as he had leaned down to capture her lips in a kiss that tasted of triumph and promise.

The water had continued its steady cascade from the faucet, creating a rhythmic soundtrack to their moment of triumph.


Now, years later, Brandon raised his head to confront his reflection in the unforgiving mirror.


Water clung to his skin in stubborn droplets, while his hair hung in damp strands that framed his face.


His eyes bore the unmistakable marks of countless sleepless nights, their depths reflecting a weariness that seemed to have settled into his very bones.


Now, standing beside the porcelain sink, Brandon found himself in complete solitude, in the silence that seemed to echo with memories of happier times.


His jaw tightened with frustration as he twisted the faucet handle, cutting off the water's steady flow before retrieving a pristine towel from the cabinet to pat his skin dry.


The damp towel landed in the wicker laundry basket with a soft thud as he strode toward the mahogany
wardrobe, his movements sharp and purposeful.


Brandon's hands moved with practiced efficiency as he selected his daily uniform-crisp white shirt,charcoal trousers, and his signature tailored suit jacket-but when his fingers reached for a tie, his movements froze mid-motion.


This sterile apartment contained no spare neckties, a glaring oversight that would never have occurred during the years when Millie had been part of his daily routine.


Brandon's jaw clenched as his teeth pressed against his compressed lips.


The memory of the previous night crashed through his defenses like a rogue wave-Millie's eyes widening with disbelief and raw pain as gravity claimed her body and sent her tumbling down the unforgiving stairs.


"Ding-dong!"


The apartment's doorbell shattered his troubled


thoughts with its cheerful chime.


Brandon pulled the door open to reveal Vivian standing in the hallway, her delicate frame silhouetted against the morning light.


Vivian's smile bloomed across her pale features,sweet yet tinged with an underlying fragility as she gazed up at him. "Good morning, Brandon. I've brought you fresh flowers to brighten your day-.aren't they lovely?"


She stepped closer, cradling a carefully arranged bouquet that she had assembled with her own hands during the early morning hours, their perfume dancing through the air and creating an aura of vulnerable beauty around her that stirred his protective instincts.


However, his mind immediately conjured Giffard's cutting words from their dawn encounter, delivered with the bite of arctic wind-"If you're set on being with Vivian, then stay with her. What happens to Millie is no longer your concern. Brandon, the only real choice you have now is to let her go."

Brandon's jaw muscles contracted with renewed tension.





Giffard's patronizing and self-righteous attitude had ignited a fire of revulsion within his chest.


Could Millie possibly be orchestrating this elaborate manipulation to force his hand into submission?


Was she resorting to petty theatrics and calculated performances-perhaps even attempting to provoke his jealousy by cultivating a relationship with Giffard?


The sensation of losing control over the situation filled him with a consuming rage that threatened to devour his rationality.


"Is something troubling you, Brandon? Does this particular arrangement not appeal to your taste?"Vivian inquired with genuine concern, her soft voice cutting through his internal turmoil.


His scattered thoughts snapped back to the present moment, and Brandon extended his hand to accept the fragrant offering.

"Not at all," he replied, his voice carrying a deliberate steadiness.



If Millie intended to manipulate him through such transparent tactics, he would demonstrate that Brandon Watson could not be easily bent to anyone's will.



"I find them absolutely enchanting," Brandon assured Vivian, his words carefully chosen to convey appreciation.


Vivian possessed only six precious months remaining in this world.



Her terminal illness bore the weight of his partial responsibility, which meant caring for her had transformed from a chpice into an inescapable obligation-a debt that honor demanded he repay.



"That brings me such joy to hear." Vivian's smile bloomed once more, brightening her entire countenance.



The pair departed the building together shortly
afterward, their figures cutting through the morning bustle of the city.


Persistent paparazzi shadowed their every step, their cameras capturing each moment with ruthless precision.


Within hours, a sensational headline had conquered the trending topics across every major platform -"Brandon and Vivian emerge from apartment.together. The perpetually impeccablè Mr. Watson appeared without his signature tie-was this an oversight or something far more intimate?"


The explosive post featured crystal-clear photographs of Vivian's morning flower delivery and the couple's synchronized departure from the luxury building.


The images ignited a wildfire of speculation and ravenous curiosity among netizens across the digital landscape.


Digital discussions erupted into a frenzy of theories and debates, but this time, Millie chose to break her
customary silence by issuing an official public response.
###Chapter 23 Prepare For Divorce





By late afternoon, Millie's public statement had already made its way online.


Her long-dormant account suddenly sprang to life as she posted.


What she wrote was simple and direct. "Rumors about Brandon, Vivian, and me have gotten out of hand. Brandon and I are still legally married. I hope this nonsense stops now. The rest will become clear when the time is right."


The backlash was almost instant, with negativity flooding the comments section.


"Nonsense,' she said? Why not just leave Brandon already?"


"Seriously! Vivian's on her deathbed-can't you at least show some decency and ask for a divorce so they could be together?"
"This whole post is revolting. Are you here to mark your territory as his wife and throw shade at Vivian?If you can't hold onto your husband, maybe look at yourself first!"


"Why bother pointing out you're still legally married?We all know what you're trying to do."


"I can't handle people who dance around the truth.Vivian confessed her feelings for Brandon out in the open!"


"Exactly. And Vivian and Brandon never crossed any lines. She just gave him a ride to work. Journalists even confirmed with timelines and photos that Vivian was there only a few minutes-unless Brandon broke some Olympic record in bed..."


"Stop talking nonsense! Mr. Watson's not that type of person..."







Comment after comment, criticism continued to pour in. Inside the quiet hospital room, Charles gave Millie
a look filled with concern and confusion.


He said, "All you really did was hand them a chance to let out everything they were holding back."


Millie set her phone aside, unfazed. "Whether it's my post or someone else's, they'll always find a place to unload. It makes no difference."


A crease formed on Charles's forehead. "But why make it so understated? You didn't even bring in a lawyer. What's the point of a statement like this?"


Looking him in the eye, Millie explained, "That's exactly what I wanted. This isn't about changing minds. It's just proof that I said something-nothing more."


Still puzzled, Charles could only trust her judgment.Millie carried herself with quiet certainty, and he was sure her decision wouldn't harm the company.


No connection tied Millie to the employment contracts signed by "Eva" or "Serena" after all.


Pushing her phone aside, she turned her energy

toward preparing for her Heavenly Melody's debut performance.


Charles never learned that Millie had a much deeper motive behind her public statement.


To begin with, she wanted it known she had witnessed the flood of nasty gossip about her,Brandon, and Vivian.


Posting her thoughts also sent a subtle message-a reminder to Brandon and Vivian that their behavior had not escaped her notice.



Beyond that, every harsh comment collected beneath her words would later serve as proof of the emotional distress she suffered, helping to demonstrate that her marriage with Brandon had truly unraveled.


Smooth divorce proceedings were the outcome she desperately hoped for.


In case things grew complicated, Millie was more than willing to take the initiative and apply for a trial
on her own.


There was no way she would cling to Brandon any longer.









Elsewhere, in the Watson Group's corporate tower,a knock sounded against the office door.


Brandon's eyes lifted to see Eugene entering.


"What's going on?" he asked.


Crossing the room, Eugene handed over a tablet."Mrs. Watson just released a statement on her social account."


The news left Brandon with a trace of irritation.


Back when they married, Brandon had insisted that any posts made under her name should get his approval, because she was no longer just Millie-she was his wife. Yet today...


Checking his own phone, Brandon found no message from her at all.


She had moved ahead without consulting him.


He took the tablet from Eugene and scanned the statement for himself.


Swiping to the comment section, he saw the backlash firsthand.


Usually, Brandon let the company's PR experts deal with online chaos, rarely bothering to check these things himself. This time, though, he read every word from the public, taking it in for the very first time.


One thought came to him immediately-since she managed to post, her injuries from the fall couldn't be serious.



A fresh wave of realization hit Brandon-Millie was definitely stirring the pot.


Choosing not to send him a message, she instead made her point using the one platform she knew would catch his eye, firmly reminding everyone of their marriage.


Familiar with his habits, she understood that any


update from that account would never go unnoticed by him.


From across the room, Eugene asked, "Should I get in touch with Mrs. Watson and bring in PR?"


Brandon let the tablet rest on his desk, brushing the idea aside. "Leave it alone."


Retrieving the tablet, Eugene gave a small nod."And what about Miss Simpson?"


With a gentle drumming of his fingertips against the polished wood, Brandon replied, "That's something I'll deal with myself."


A moment of silence hung in the air before Brandon asked, "What's Macauley up to these days?"


Caught off guard, Eugene needed a second to recall,his voice dropping to a whisper. "He's gone back to his hometown. Your orders have kept him far from Crobert."


A sideways glance at Brandon told Eugene all he needed to know. "You made it clear-he'll have a hard time fitting in anywhere for now."


Brandon acknowledged this with the barest nod.


As Eugene exited, tablet in hand, Brandon let his gaze wander out the floor-to-ceiling windows.


From his office at the summit of the Watson Group tower, the city's wind still managed to make its presence felt.


Gusts swept over Crobert with unrelenting force.


Nothing had slowed this wind, which moved like an invisible tide across the whole country.


Below, the city buzzed with energy, its people rushing through their daily routines.


Business carried on, no matter how the weather roared outside.


Newly bloomed April flowers scattered their petals into the currents, leaving the air heavy with a bittersweet, romantic feeling that bordered on lonely.


Eventually, even that relentless wind faded away.


Three days slipped by in a blur.


Though Millie's body remained fragile, her recovery had come along-especially the spells of dizziness left from her concussion.



During those days, she poured her efforts into preparing for her debut performance. She rehearsed her song, coordinated her outfit, and picked out the right makeup.


Following her miscarriage, she was still weak and had to avoid exposure to wind, cold water, and any foods that might sap her strength. Spring's warmth had started to return, but she still dressed in long sleeves and pants, protecting herself until she was ready to face the world again.


Bedridden for three days, Millie still managed to give her statement to the police between moments of rest.



Each piece of information she offered carried the hope that investigators would wrap up the case soon.
Day by day, life began to feel alittle brighter-like the city warming after a fierce storm.


Recovery was within reach.


When the morning of Heavenly Melody's live debut arrived, Millie rose, washed, and lingered a moment before her reflection.


A striking red dress waited on the rack nearby, every rose-layered detail vivid as fire, its artistry evoking petals blooming from embers.


Set just beside the dress, her mask sat in pristine condition,ready to complete the look.


Thick rose appliques curled along the mask's surface, lending it an air of wild beauty and danger.


All this fiery glamour clashed with the pale, reed-thin woman standing quietly beside it.


A mere handful of days had cost her ten pounds.


Already slight, she now seemed as delicate as a breath of wind.
She slipoped into the scarlet dress, hooked the oversized rose tassel earrings, and finally reached for the mask.


No hint of hesitation showed as she pressed the mask to her face.


The fit was seamless, her features now hidden from the world.


A new figure stared back from the mirror-a vision transformed.



Serena.


###Chapter 24 A Miscarriage





"Yes, I'm with her now. I'll take her over myself."Charles' voice came just before his footsteps reached the door. He gave a quick knock and stepped inside.



The moment he caught sight of Millie, he stopped.


"Wait... are you-Millie?" His voice held hesitation,like he wasn't sure if he was seeing correctly.


It wasn't his fault. Millie had changed. She was thinner now, wore a mask, and had dressed with such quiet intensity that her beauty looked almost unreal-so striking that even Alexia might not recognize her at a glance.


Millie caught the look on his face and gave a small.nod,almost apologetic.


"It's me," she said simply. "Let's go."
Charles nodded slowly, like his brain hadn't caught up with his heartbeat.


Millie had always been beautiful. But this was different.





Before, her beauty was soft, something that blended gently into the room. Now, it was sharp and bold.


Without saying anything, Charles picked up along coat and carefully draped it over her shoulders.


Then he helped her outside, guiding her toward a sleek SUV waiting by the curb.


Inside, a stylist was already set up, ready with tools,nail polish, and heels lined up in a row. They began the finishing touches while the driver pulled onto the road, heading straight for the live broadcast of Heavenly Melody.


At the same time, another car was making its way there. And this one carrying Vivian.


In the backseat, Vivian sat as the makeup artist worked carefully around her eyes, building the image


she wanted-soft, delicate, almost fragile-while she called Brandon.


"Brandon, it's me-Vivian," she said sweetly. "Yes,today's the first live taping. You have to come.I saved a seat just for you. They're only letting me in because of you, Brandon. I'm really grateful for everything. I'll give it my best, I promise."


After she hung up, she sent a quick text. "Brandon.will be attending today. Make sure the follow-up steps are ready."


When a simple "OK" came back, Vivian leaned back and smiled, satisfied.






Backstage at Heavenly Melody, Millie stood among the other contestants.


A stir moved through the room. Millie looked up to see Vivian walking in, her assistant following behind.


Most of the contestants were from smaller labels or were fresh faces just getting their start. They had already been told-"Don't cross Vivian Simpson."


So as soon as she entered, one by one, they stood to greet her.


"Miss Simpson!"


"Pleasure to meet you, Miss Simpson!"


"Hello, Miss Simpson!"


Millie stayed where she was, silent in the background, her eyes steady.


She had learned the rules of the industry long ago.


Vivian had Brandon's support now-the entire Watson Group was behind her. That alone was enough to make people treat her like royalty.


But Millie had no interest in playing along.


She turned quietly and walked away, without a word.


Vivian, warm and friendly with the others, took note of the silent figure slipping out. Her eyes paused for a moment. She had read up on all twelve contestants.She knew eleven well. Only one name, Serena Ellsworth, had no clear profile.


The others had background info, pictures, past work.But Serena's details were sealed.


Even with the Watson Group's name behind her,Vivian couldn't get past the block.


The staff only told her Serena was under Charles'personal management, and that all records were kept within Evans Entertainment.



Vivian just met Serena backstage, but nothing about her sparked no memory.


Confident, cool, slightly distant-maybe she was Charles' girlfriend?


It didn't matter. Vivian had already dealt with Brandon's wife. Charles' mystery lover wouldn't be harder.



With that, she put the thought aside.
Elsewhere, Millie stood beside the stage, quietly reviewing the setup.


The show had twelve contestants, three judges, and a five-round competition format, each round spaced a week apart.


The show aired live first, with a shorter, polished version uploaded later for viewers who preferred quick highlights.


Today's live broadcast was the first of the season-a soft opening, mainly to introduce the performers,meet the judges, and split everyone into teams.


Twelve contestants, three teams-each led by a judge.





Vivian was one of the judges. The other two were well-known singers with solid reputations in the industry.


Millie stepped onto the stage, choosing her spot with care.



She hadn't joined the earlier rehearsals in person.
Back then, she was still recovering and had only watched and helped coordinate remotely.


That absence had stirred whispers. Some said she was difficult. Said she thought too highly of herself.Charles had handled it behind the scenes. He sent out a medical report-her name carefully removed-confirming that Serena had been through a serious accident just ten days before.


Now, with her standing here under the stage lights,people could see the faint bruises along her arms,even with makeup doing its best to hide them.


The rumors died quickly. The truth was visible enough.





Millie noticed some of, the staff watching her curiously. She didn't know why and didn't care to guess.She kept her attention on the setup.


A stir rippled through the venue. She looked up instinctively.


Brandon had arrived. She heard the whispers behind
her.


"Wait... that's Mr. Watson, right?"


"What's he doing here? Didn't he usually avoid public events like this?"


"You know who's on the guest list."


"Oh, right. He's here for Vivian."


"Of course. The Watson Group has some investments in entertainment, but it's mostly tech.The only person here who could bring Brandon to a set like this is Vivian."



"So those rumors are true?"


"Looks like it."



"Doesn't he have a wife though?"


"This is common among the rich. And Vivian's sick.His wife probably lets it go. I think Vivian's a better match. At least she's strong enough to deal with it.The wife probably clings to the Watson name and looks the other way."


"If my boyfriend ever pulled something like that, I'd walk out. No hesitation. A woman who tolerates that kind of thing deserves what she gets."


Charles' voice came in, cold and sharp. "That's enough.You know better than to gossip here."


The room fell silent immediately.


He walked up to Millie, his eyes scanning her face for、any reaction.


He couldn't say much with people around, but his concern was clear.


Millie caught his look and gave him a small smnile,followed by a slight shake of her head.


She wasn't bothered. She had already made her peace with letting Brandon go. So what if people talked?



"I've arranged for someone to go through the program with you backstage," Charles said. "Let's head there."


Millie nodded and walked with him toward the side of the stage.


Meanwhile, Vivian had reached Brandon.


"Brandon," she greeted warmly with a smile.


"Mm." He gave her a nod, his eyes already drifting past her. He caught a glimpse of a woman in a long coat walking beside Charles.


Vivian noticed. "That's Serena Ellsworth," she said casually. "The one I told you about. She's probably Charles' secret girlfriend."


Brandon raised an eyebrow.


"She missed rehearsals," Vivian went on. "People said she was acting like a diva. But then Charles submitted a medical report-said she'd been in an accident ten days ago, so she couldn't make it."Vivian leaned in slightly, voice lowered, but her smile wide. "I didn't think much of it-until I heard something more private."


She paused. "The accident involved a miscarriage."
###Chapter 25 Glimmer Of Love





A sense of mystery hung over the situation.


Only a handful of people knew the truth, and Vivian had been forced to rely on Brandon's influence just to dig up the details. Within the company, the matter was locked down as highly confidential.


Most employees had simply heard that Serena's injuries were serious enough to keep her bedridden.


Charles had been the one to champion Serena's rise.Even though he was just the third Evans son, the Evans family's reach and power were legendary.


He held the reins as CEO of Evans Entertainment, a major branch of the Evans Group and one of Crobert's top three entertainment empires.


Rumors circled about his personal life. He had never married or publicly dated anyone. Whenever he lavished attention on a woman, most assumed she


was someone special, maybe even a secret lover.


Brandon listened to Vivian's theory without showing any opinion.


He normally paid little attention to other people's affairs, yet something about that shadowy figure beside Charles he glimpsed earlier managed to stir his curiosity.


Still, he convinced himself it meant nothing.






Meanwhile, the dressing room backstage buzzed with activity as Millie finalized last-minute details with staff.


With so much happening behind the scenes, Charles had been pulled away to handle urgent matters. He might be the company's CEO, but he couldn't stay glued to Millie all night. To help out, he had assigned her an assistant.


Barbara Myers, all sharp eyes behind thick glasses and a practical air beneath her cuteness, was a whirlwind of efficiency as she helped Millie prepare.



A flurry of notes filled her clipboard as she murmured, "Stage is set. Lineup confirmed. Serena you're third to go on stage."



A slight nod from Millie acknowledged the update.


Unexpectedly, she felt the weight of someone's gaze.





Lifting her eyes, she spotted Vivian at the far end of the room.


Vivian offered a polite smile and a small nod.


With a blank look, Millie simply regarded her, refusing to engage further.


Barbara leaned in and whispered, "Mr. Evans asked me to pass on a warning. Vivian has a powerful,secretive team backing her-not the Watsons. Every move she makes, every word she says, is planned out by her people. Best to steer clear of her unless there's no choice." Which, in other words, meant that if confrontation was unavoidable, she'd have to be ready.


Turning away, Millie gave a silent nod, showing she understood.


Vivian looked away too, but the moment her eyes shifted, the smile slipped right off her face.


Such boldness for someone who was supposedly nothing more than a man's secret lover!


Yet beneath Vivian's gentle expression, a calculating glimmer flashed.


Even if Serena's position was merely that of a kept woman, Vivian saw potential for her own advantage.






The broadcast kicked off, signaling the start of the live show.



Three judges took the stage in quick succession.


First came two established names in music, both delivering polished introductions and impressive acts.



When it was Vivian's turn, the energy in the room subtly shifted.


All eyes were drawn to her as she entered beneath the bright stage lights, her white gown shimmering with an almost ethereal glow.



Facing the audience, she remarked with confidence,"Good evening, I'm Vivian Simpson, and by trade, I'm a floral designer. It's an honor to be here tonight.Some of you may be wondering what brought a floral designer to this stage. Many have accused me of chasing publicity. Well, they're not wrong-Iam!"


Her words, punctuated with a fearless smile, rang out with refreshing honesty.'



She directed her gaze straight into the camera, her tone steady. "I want the world to see me-see the ways I'm searching for a new direction, see how it's possible to shine even when you're backed into a corner."


There was something about the way her delicate smile paired with her message that tugged at the hearts of those watching, drawing tears from more than a few in the audience.



From her seat backstage, Millie reclined in the lounge, fighting the aches in her body as she quietly took in Vivian's performance.



What exactly was it that drew Brandon to Vivian?


Could it be this determined spirit, or was there something about her boldness that echoed who he once was?



People often found themselves moved by others who mirrored the vulnerable versions of their past.


That sense of care, that impulse to help, was sometimes really about soothing a wound in themselves rather than in another.


For men however, these tangled feelings of sympathy could easily become something deeper.


Vivian faced the audience with composure. "I'd like


to share a song called 'Glimmer of Love.' It captures the journey l've taken lately. Maybe it will bring hope to anyone else out there who's had to push through pain to stay strong."


After a deep, respectful bow, she disappeared as the lights faded to black.


A hint of surprise flickered across Millie's face."Glimmer of Love?"


She remembered titling it "Glimmer of Light" in her original draft.


Her intent had been for the song to reflect moving on from the past and searching for new possibilities,with the breaking dawn as its central image.


But if Vivian wanted a different name, so be it. Their agreement allowed for artistic changes.


Now the real question was whether the final release would credit both "Eva" and Evans Entertainment as promised.


The backstage area split into two distinct sections.
One space, designed like a small hall, let contestants and judges mingle and chat.


Beyond that, individual private lounges gave each performer a place to retreat and prepare.


Most people didn't have time to watch an entire live show, so the producers planned to create a snappier,edited version for online viewers.



Reactions from various contestants and judges would be needed to round out the final cut.



Screens and recording gear dotted both the public hall and private lounges, allowing for both viewing and feedback recording.


None of this, however, would go out unedited-production would stitch together the best moments according to their plan.


Recording devices weren't standard in the dressing rooms, unless someone broke the rule and took it upon themselves to set something up.


Right now, Millie relaxed in her private lounge,


Barbara never far from her side.


A large wall-mounted screen showed Vivian's performance as it played live on stage.


Along the screen's edge, a flurry of comments appeared.


"That opening is gorgeous! This whole performance is breathtaking!"


"Why am I already crying? Even those first few seconds leaked online made me tear up-now | can't stop!"


"My heart feels too full. I don't even know which ex I'm supposed to be thinking about right now sobbing."



"Can anyone spare a boyfriend for me?"


"Let's start a waiting list for boyfriend sharing!"


"Count me in. I wouldn't mind two, if we're being honest."
"Those 25 seconds have been everywhere lately-background music for every trending video. I thought I'd be sick of it by now, but hearing the full version here makes me cry all over again."


"Millie, are you glued to the broadcast right now? Still refusing to bow out with a little grace and file for divorce?"


"I'll say it again! Millie's twenty-five years mean nothing next to Vivian's twenty-five seconds!"






While online chatter reached a fever pitch, Millie sat comfortably in her private lounge, scrolling through her phone and browsing music apps.


Vivian had promised the world that "Glimmer of Love" would drop on every major platform the moment she performed it. Verifying the song's credits would only take a glance. There was no need to dig deep.


The moment Millie opened the first app, the song
popped up in a full-screen ad, paired with a sleek photo of Vivian looking perfectly put together.


Millie tapped the screen and read it line by line."Glimmer of Love. Singer: Vivian Simpson. Lyrics:Vivian Simpson.Composer:Vivian Simpson."
###Chapter 26 It's Millie Who's Blocking Your Way
App after app, Millie methodically scrolled through the music platforms on her phone.


Her curiosity led her to the search engine, where she discovered a dedicated Wikipedia page for the new release.


Vivian's name showed up in every spot. She was listed as the lyricist, the composer, and the performer.


A quiet laugh escaped Millie as she set her phone aside.



Vivian wasn't afraid to take risks and didn't try to hide it.



If there had been recent negotiations with Evans Entertainment, Charles would have found out immediately. He followed these things closely, and so did Millie.


Reality, however, told a different story. Vivian had never reached out.


With Charles' notoriously short temper and his zero tolerance for unfairness, there was no way he would have let this go unnoticed.


Had Vivian truly missed that point?


Maybe she just didn't care about Evans Entertainment's stance.


Perhaps she believed Brandon could fix anything that might come up.


Or, given that her days were numbered, she simply had nothing left to lose.


Lost in these questions, Millie suddenly heard a quiet sniffle beside her.


Turning, she caught sight of Barbara hastily dabbing at her cheeks with a tissue.


The moment Barbara noticed Millie looking, she explained, her voice breaking, "Gosh, I couldn't help it. This song just hit me so hard. Sorry, I didn't mean to compliment the competition so much... oh, right,Vivian's not a contestant. She's a guest judge. I'm all mixed up."


Crying had left the poor assistant flustered and a little embarrassed.



Millie couldn't help but find her adorable, so she offered another tissue, her voice gentle. "Don't worry about it. Honestly, I think the song is beautiful too."


After all, the music was her own creation to begin with.





A sense of relief washed over Barbara.


Onstage, Vivian's performance reached its end.Tears streaked her face as the cameras lingered,capturing a portrait of both vulnerability and strength.


A quick camera sweep brought the audience's attention straight to Brandon.
His seat had been carefully chosen, providing him with both an excellent view and a sense of seclusion.



Few people in the crowd had actually spotted him,despite the persistent rumors swirling about his attendance.



Yet the moment the broadcast panned away from the stage, Brandon's presence was impossible to miss.


A close-up filled the screen, capturing him in crisp detail.


Every part of him looked composed. His tailored suit showed off his slim frame, and not one movement gave away a hint of nerves. He carried himself with calm confidence and a kind of ease that didn't need any show.


Though his hands rested with casual ease, anyone watching closely might have caught a faint redness around his eyes, which could have been the lights or something more.


The reaction online was explosive, with messages and squeals filling the comments.


"Oh my god, it's really Mr.Watson!"


"There's something about Mr. Watson today/. He looks more striking than usual."


"He never goes to these things! He's only here because of Vivian-if that's not love, what is?"


"Those red eyes say it all! Vivian's performance must have touched him deeply."


"I'm obsessed! Their romance is the stuff of dreams!"





"Millie, you can't hide anymore. Come and deal with this!"









A graceful bow from Vivian drew the audience's gaze back to the stage.


She brushed the tears away from her eyes, her features softening into something gentle and beautiful.
"Thank you all-especially that special someone in my life," Vivian whispered, her words directed both to the audience and to a certain someone she never named, her smile gentle but secretive.


"No matter how short my days may be, or how hard the road ahead gets, your presence makes me fearless," she remarked as the stage lights lifted,filling the space with a sense of hope.


Still wiping at his own tears, the host returned to center stage. "Vivian, that performance was incredible. The entire audience is moved! Can you tell us-who is that special someone you mentioned?"


Vivian's response was only a smile, her silence more telling than words, and the cameras lingered for a moment before cutting back to Brandon, letting the mystery linger in the air.


A few light words were exchanged before Vivian left the stage.


The spotlight soon shifted as contestants prepared for their performances.
 With the first singer wrapping up, a call came for Millie to get ready.


Down the backstage hallway, Millie made her way forward and unexpectedly crossed paths with Vivian,who had just come from a conversation with Brandon in the audience and was heading backstage.


Their steps slowed as they neared one another.


"Serena," Vivian then called out, catching Millie's attention.


Millie's steps faltered for a brief moment as she glanced toward Vivian.



A bright smile played across Vivian's lips. "Did yoLI enjoy it? My performance, I mean."


Soft laughter escaped Millie. "The song was wonderful."





Vivian's smile grew wider. "I believe my song should prove my talent to you."


Only a silent laugh came from Millie.
Words kept flowing from Vivian. "Later on, when teams are formed, would you consider joining mine?"


The day marked the premiere of the show, which introduced both contestants and judges to the audience and included a segment for forming teams.


Four contestants would be chosen by each of the three judges, with mutual selection taking place.


A question lingered on Millie's lips. "I have not even performed yet, and you are already offering? What if I ruin your team's chances?"


Vivian responded with confidence, "I expect you to pick me, since we share a common adversary." She stepped in, closing the space between them.


Her voice dropped as she leaned in and whispered,"Serena,have you ever wondered why you cannot be Charles' official girlfriend?"


A puzzled lift of Millie's brow revealed her confusion at Vivian's words.



Those words-"Charles' girlfriend"?
Was Vivian really talking about her?


Pleased with Millie's reaction, Vivian leaned back."There is someone standing in your way."


A question came without hesitation. "Who?" Millie wanted to know what game Vivian was playing.


Vivian's smile grew wider as she slowly opened her mouth and said, "It's Millie Bennett. She's the one、standing in your way."


Confusion filled Millie's eyes as she stared at Vivian,lost for words.



A quick adjustment of posture followed from Vivian."You may doubt it now, but one day you will see that l am telling the truth."


As she prepared to leave, Vivian's gaze dropped pointedly to Millie's stomach and she spoke again."It must be agony to lose a child, am I right?"


Vivian left those words hanging in the air and walked away,her silence cutting deeper than anything else.


Down the hall, staff members called out for Millie,urging her to hurry along, so she moved on without a backward glance.


A few paces later, Vivian glanced over her shoulder,her expression one of triumph as she watched Millie walk away.


Every bit of her timing was intentional.


She had carefully picked this very moment to reveal this "secret" to Serena.


The first goal was clear. Vivian wanted to cloud Serena's thoughts and make her falter on stage.


There had been no rehearsal attendance from Serena. Vivian could not judge the girl's talent, nor had she sent anyone to test her. Most likely, Serena did not even know the competition's rules.


The night was meant to be Vivian's triumph, and she was determined to shine brighter than anyone else.


A second reason burned beneath the surface.Vivian aimed to plant resentment for Millie in the heart of Serena, the woman Charles kept at his side but never made official.


Pain must have been lingered from losing a child for Charles, only to remain unrecognized by him.Surely Serena must harbor suspicions or feel bitterness.



If any anger existed, Vivian wanted it aimed squarely at Millie.



Her goal was to use this woman as a weapon against Millie.



Thinking through each step, Vivian found no fault in her plan. A sense of satisfaction washed over her as she turned away and moved backstage.


At the end of the corridor, Millie paused, her eyes following Vivian's fading figure.


She kept silent.


Elsewhere, in a dimly lit monitoring room, two people listened intently as the recording from the "Backstage Corridor" device played, their eyes round with shock. A whisper broke the silence. "Do you think we should tell someone about this?"
###Chapter 27 Bruises
"Not yet. Feels like something bigger is about to drop,"another replied quickly. "If we reveal it now, it'll kill the impact. Better to wait a little longer."


Vivian still didn't fully grasp the truth about how the showbiz worked.



The number of recording devices publicly listed never matched the real count.


There were always extra cameras, hidden mics, and people recording on the sly.


That was where the big scoops came from-the shadows.





And even then, only a small part of the mess ever reached the public. Most were bought off before it could make headlines.







Backstage, the stage manager leaned over and said,"The second performer's almost done.Serena, get ready."



At the cue, Millie stepped out into the lights.Out in the audience,Brandon stood. He hadn't planned to stay long



Events like this weren't his thing, and he'd only come to see Vivian perform.



Now that she was done, he saw no reason to remain.



But he had barely taken a few steps when the third contestant walked onstage.



He turned instinctively.



"And now, please welcome to the stage-Serena Ellsworth," the host announced. The name caught his attention. Vivian had mentioned Serena before,calling her Charles' secret lover.



He hadn't thought much of it then. But now, for some reason,he paused.



People had been whispering about this woman all day -the contestant in the mask. Now, here she was.



She stepped to the center of the stage,her hands relaxed around the mic. The first few notes left her lips-soft,steady, threaded with something intimate.



The room hushed itself. The crowd, which had been whispering just seconds ago, fell into silence.


Brandon frowned slightly. There was something familiar about the way she sang.


Not the voice exactly. but the tone The vibe was close to Millie's style. But it vasn't a copy



Serena's voice was deeper, more seasoned. There was a quiet sadness in the way she held her notes-like someone who'd walked through fire and didn't need to talk about it.



It wasn't dramatic. But it lingered. Soft, and then sharp.and then gone-like smoke. But it stayed with you.



Brandon's eyes narrowed as he looked closer. The woman on stage was dressed in a rose-red outfit that flared like flames.



Her figure and styling were all wrong for Millie.



She couldn't be Millie.



As the performance moved on, the soft hum grew curling upward into a rising swell until Millie's voice broke through, clear and fierce, shattering the quiet and carrying the song to its peak.



The lights flared. Fire danced around the stage in bursts. Then everything went dark. A single spotlight switched on. Millie stood in its center, holding a violin.



Petals fell from above, drifting around her like snow.Then came the music. Not soft. Not sweet. It tore through the room-aching and beautiful.



She played in her red dress. The spotlight shifted,casting a clearer view of her arms, her collarbone,her shoulders-bruises.



Barely covered with makeup, they revealed themselves under the light.



They ran along her skin, more visible near her joints - rougher patches that told the story of deep Wounds.



Together, the music and the image struck something in the audience.



The flames that surrounded her weren't just for effect.It was a return. She was a woman reborn. A phoenix rising from the ashes.



Millie stood beneath the lights, dressed in deep red,the violin pressed against her shoulder. Each note she drew out carved through the air.



The music built, sharp and unyielding, and not a single gaze turned away.



To those watching, she was now more than a performer-she was someone who had walked through fire and come out shining.



Even after the last note faded and the flames slipped into silence, the audience remained still, held in the weight of what they had just witnessed.



Millie lowered her violin slowly, her gaze lifting just in time to see Brandon nearby



Their eyes met.



Brandon's brow drew in slightly.


His heart thudded harder than it should have. Maybe it was the intensity of the performance. Or maybe it was something else.


There was something about her. Dangerous. Distant.But impossible to look away from.



Then the applause began-loud, rising like a wave.swallowing the silence.


Surrounded by claps and cheers that filled the air,it was Brandon who looked away first, quietly turning his back on her



"Thank you," Millie said softly from the stago,her voice steady, almost too calm for what had just happened



Brandon glanced over at Charles,who looked thrilled



But all Brandon could think about were her bruisos What kind of man let his woman suffer like that and seemed more focused on the song than her pain?


Still,he reminded himself-it was none of his business



She wasn't his woman.



Without another glance, Brandon turned and left.



On stage, Millie gave a deep bow to the audience and followed the staff's cue to exit.



Offstage,Barbara rushed over, nearly bouncing


"Serena, that was incredible! I mean it-I got chills!"she said, clutching Millie's hand.


Millie flinched a little but still gave her a small smile."Thank you."



She had only rested for three days. It wasn't enough.



Before, she remained seated as much as she could.But up there on stage, she hadn't held back.



Now,her body was catching up to her.



"Serena, who did your special effects makeup? These bruises look unbelievably real!" Barbara leaned closer,eyes wide.


"Careful," Charles said, stepping in quickly and pulling Barbara aside. "Those aren't fake."
"What?" Barbara froze. She looked down at her hand.



The makeup had smeared slightly, revealing the raw truth underneath.



"Oh no..."' Barbara covered her mouth, her voice shaking. "I didn't mean to-Serena, I'm so sorry, I didn't know-"



Millie let out a quiet laugh and gave a small shake of her head. Barbara didn't know any better.


Barbara looked like she might cry. Millie leaned against her with a whisper of a grin.



"Could you lend me a hand? I'm really at my limit."



"Of course!" Barbara immediately looped her arm under Millie's.



But they didn't get far. Just a few steps in, V/ivian appeared, blocking the path with a perfectly timed smile.



"Your performance was stunning," she said. "Truly.Congratulations,Serena."



Millie looked at herbut said nothing.



Vivian went on, still smiling. "Remember what I told you earlier? About that person? I wasn't lying. If you want the full story, come to me later."
Around them, applause still echoed faintly through the hall.



Millie let out a light laugh. "No need."



She turned to Charles briefly. He didn't understand what she meant.



Then,without another word, she left with Barbara and Charles beside her.



Vivian stayed behind, watching their backs disappear.



She had come to provoke, to shake her. If anything,Serena had gone out and stolen the entire show.



Right after the performance had started, she had stormed into the control room and used Brandon's name to pressure the staff-asking them to lower Serena's broadcast quality.



To Vivian, Serena was completely oblivious-this was her moment, yet Serena had the nerve to draw all the light to herself.


Vivian's eyes narrowed, calculating. She pulled out her phone and dialed, her mind already spinning with her next move.
###Chapter 28 The Demo



In the private lounge, Charles and Barbara helped Millie into a chair. Her body was clearly worn out.


"Barbara, get Serena some water please," Charles said,waving her off gently.


When the door closed behind her, it was just the two of them left.



Though the lounge was private, the recording equipment was installed, and Charles was Serena's boss. There'd be nothing to feed the rumor mill.


Charles kept his voice casual as he asked, "What was Vivian going on about just now? I didn't quite follow."


Millie gave a quick glance at the nearby recording device, and then quietly pulled out her phone. Using her coat to block the view, she typed something and tilted the screen toward Charles.



He looked down at the words that appeared. "Vivian thinks I'm your secret lover. She came over to drop a warning-said there's someone else in your heart which prevents you from making me and our relationship official."
Charlos blinked at the words, confused.



He wouldn't have minded keeping Millie for himself.Sho would never accopt that though, and he knew it



If she ever thought that was what he was after, she'd disappear from his life without a second thought.


"Think about it. What did you do to make her think that?" Millie said, voice low.


Charles thought for a moment, and then it hit him.


He started to speak, but Millie gently pressed her hand to his arm, stopping him.



He got the message. Instead, he pulled out his phone and typed a reply, keeping it hidden beneath his coat



"When you didn't show up to rehearsal and people started talking, I shared your medical report with the internal team. It was real, but I removed your name and changed the date to ten days ago. The word 'miscarriage' was in there. She must've seen it and thought you were pregnant with my baby."



Millie read the screen and nodded. That explained everything.



She turned to the live feed playing in the corner.



A contestant's voice filled the room. The stage lights flickered across the screen.



Charles watched her for a second, and then said quietly, "He's here. Did you know?"



"Yeah," she answered, like it didn't matter.



Charles hesitated, wanting to say more, but then changed his mind.







Across town, a black Bentley glided through the city streets. Brandon sat in the back seat, his tablet on his lap,reviewing company files like always.


But his eyes drifted. Out the window, roses bloomed along the edge of the road, and for a moment,he saw the woman in the red dress again-bold, graceful,untouchable.



Only one person came to mind when he thought of those words.



Up front, Eugene noticed the shift in his boss 'expression and smiled. "Miss Simpson did well today,didn't she?"he asked.



"She did," Brandon replied, though he still hadn't looked away from the window.



"I figured," Eugene said, tapping on his tablet. "It's all over the Internet. People are saying it's the first time you've ever shown up for a recording like this. Must be because of Miss Simpson."



He kept talking, but Brandon wasn't listening anymore.



It wasn't that he didn't watch variety shows. He just didn't watch them for entertainment. He had only ever watched them for Millie.



The Watson Group had no intention of investing in entertainment, but he had created a media department anyway-just to make room for her.But too bad she had already signed with Evans Entertainment by then.



Millie had grown up around music. Started with piano,moved to violin, picked up guitar, even tried the drums.She had a gift-and the discipline to master it.



Back then, he would often find himself standing on the balcony, watching the Bennett house from a distance.



Brandon quietly watched the rows of red roses blur past outside the car window.



They reminded him of her. Millie, when they were younger-loud,bright, fearless. Maybe influenced by her mother, Millie used to wear red all the time.



That year,MMillie, still the heiress of the Bennett family, had worn a red dress and stood in the garden, violin in hand, surrounded by fallen leaves. Her long, slightly curled hair moved with the wind, the red of her dress blending with the maple trees behind her. All the boys noticed.



He had been one of them.



When did that version of her disappear?



Brandon lowered his eyes slightly.


Maybe it was the collapse of the Bennett family. Or maybe it began with what happened to her mother.



As for the idea of this being some rare exception,Brandon didn't bother defending it.



He had made so many exceptions in his life that the word had lost meaning.







Meanwhile, the live broadcast was still going strong,sending waves through the Internet.


Vivian's performance had drawn the first round of attention. Especially her song-"Glimmer of Love."


It hit fast. Social media was flooded with praise and speculation. One particular comment went viral. "This is heartbreaking. I could feel how much Vivian loves Brandon just from the way she sang it. Even while fighting terminal stomach cancer, her love for him hasn't faded. This song captured her whole life's journey beautifully."


More comments followed,piling into trending threads.


"Yes. Once it all made sense,I was stunned. There's no doubt this song was meant for Vivian."



"Didn't you know? She wrote it herself!"


"The most beautiful three-line poem-Singer: Vivian.Lyricist: Vivian.Composer:Vivian."


"She's incredible. Not even a professional, and yet this performance blew everyone else away."



"Even the two earlier pros didn't match her emotion.I doubt anyone will top her performance today."



"Exactly. Vivian outshone them all."



"Honestly, the only one who can beat V/ivian is Vivian.You guys need to check the hot search right now!"







Curious viewers quickly clicked into the trending topics.#VivianGlimmerOfLove#,#VivianBrandon#,#BrandonExceptionForVivian#. And then a new one beganclimbingtheranks#GlimmerOfLoveRecordingDemo#
The link led to an old demo recording.



It wasn't polished. Not mixed or edited. The sound quality was low, a little fuzzy. But the voice-soft,clear-stopped people in their tracks.


A flood of comments followed as more people listened.





"Oh wow... this is 'Glimmer of Love,' Vivian's song,but it hits so differently in this version."


"Right? I felt more listening to this than I did during the live or official release."



"Same here. The voice-it doesn't sound exactly like the other versions."



"I saw someone say this might be the original recording. And did you notice? The file wasn't even called 'Glimmer of Love,' it was titled 'Glimmer of Light.' Maybe she recorded it casually, before they locked in the final version."



"Same here. Honestly, I think this version's better than the live one. Don't cancel me; I'm just saying."



"Honestly, I get that feeling too, but it makes sense.You heard how fuzzy the recording was, right? She was probably caught up in the moment. She's not a rained singer, so of course the demo and the final version don't sound the same."



"Either way, she's talented. Whether it's the studio.the stage, or a demo-Vivian delivered."



"She's amazing. End of story."



"Only Vivian can top Vivian."



While the Internet buzzed, Vivian stayed silent-likely still busy with the post-performance process.



But the attention around the demo kept growing. And not everyone was content to wait. So someone decided to confront Vivian live on air, ready to ask questions about the demo.
###Chapter 29 A Comparison
The trending topic faded quickly, swallowed by something far more captivating.



The reason behind this sudden shift became crystal clear when the live broadcast of Serena's "Yesterday"began airing, delivering such an electrifying spectacle that it instantly transformed into a viral sensation.



Despite Vivian's instructions for the production team to slash the broadcast's clarity and sound quality to almost nothing, the raw power of the performance still pierced through every technical barrier.



This enigmatic masked singer called Serena Ellsworth remained wrapped in impenetrable mystery, with absolutely no trace of information existing anywhere online.



Speculation about her true identity ran rampant among curious viewers, yet nobody had successfully penetrated the veil of secrecy surrounding her real persona.


The online discussions blazed with passionate intensity.



"Sweet heavens, that performance left me speechless!Who on earth could she be? I refuse to believe she's
some unknown newcomer!"



"I share your sentiment completely. I was convinced Vivian's 'Glimmer of Love' would reign supreme as tonight's undisputed masterpiece, but it turns out we've got some serious hidden talent lurking in the shadows!"



"I'm wagering it's some established superstar experimenting with a completely fresh vocal approach.What other reason would she have for hiding behind that mysterious mask?"



"I stand firmly behind that theory. This guessing game has become absolutely fascinating, and I'm hooked!"



"Both 'Glimmer of Love' and 'Yesterday' represent completely different musical worlds. I'd crown them as the Heavenly Melody's inaugural evening's cherished classic and its most surprising dark horses!"



Within moments, fresh trending topics exploded across social media platforms, including	#GlimmerOfLoveVersusYesterday#       and      #HeavenlyMelodyDarkHorses#



Countless Internet users flooded the discussions with their passionate opinions and detailed analyses.



Some declared their unwavering loyalty to "Glimmer of Love," while others championed "Yesterday" with equal fervor, but the artistic styles differed so dramatically that declaring any clear victor seemed utterly impossible.







Meanwhile, tucked away in a shadowy corner,Vivian's fury reached a boiling point as she hurled her cup against the wall, watching it shatter into countless pieces.


When the trending topic concerning the leaked demo of "Glimmer of Love" finally began to fade from public consciousness, relief had washed over her like a cool wave.



Her team had discovered in advance that someone planned to challenge her about the controversial demo,which had given her the perfect opportunity to intercept and neutralize those risks beforehand and polish the situation until it gleamed.



But what twisted fate had brought "Yesterday"crashing into her carefully laid plans?



Vivian had applied crushing pressure on the team to demolish the broadcast's quality, yet somehow this devastating outcome had still emerged!



"Vivian, please don't allow this setback to consume you," one of her PR team members offered while his fingers danced frantically through data streams. "The online conversations are indicating that 'Glimmer of Love' and 'Yesterday' are locked in a dead heat, which means we haven't suffered a crushing defeat."



Vivian's gaze cut through him like a blade forged from arctic ice.



Her voice carried the deadly chill of arctic winds. "|demand nothing less than absolute and complete victory, do you comprehend my expectations?"


The team member's shirt became drenched with cold perspiration as his mind raced desperately for viable solutions. "Perhaps we could implement this strategic approach? We can emphasize how you're not a professionally trained vocalist, yet still achieved such remarkable success in your debut performance.Highlighting this incredible contrast would ensure you tower above every other competitor!"


Vivian offered a curt nod, though her eyes continued to burn with dangerous intensity.



The man dabbed at his perspiration, feeling momentary relief wash over him.



Yet Vivian's satisfaction remained frustratingly incomplete. As she watched the man deliver instructions to his team, her voice carried deadly precision."Johnny, I've personally guided your team to the position you occupy today. You know precisely what we've all sacrificed to get here." The man, Johnny Holland, felt fresh waves of perspiration breaking across his forehead as he forced a servile smile across his face. "I was absolutely nothing before this; I'm only standing here because we've joined forces. So please, rest easy, Vivian. I understand perfectly that we need each other, and only by helping you win Brandon's hand can we possibly achieve our own dreams of success."



"Excellent." Vivian nodded while her gaze remained locked on the live performance. A cunning plan began weaving itself through her thoughts like silk threads forming a web.



This masked enigma calling herself Serena possessed formidable talent, and since she was very much likely Charles' lover, any direct confrontation would prove foolishly dangerous.


Instead, Vivian would transform her into a weapon.


Why battle with a blade when she could simply grasp its handle and wield it herself?



This realization brought a predatory smile creeping across Vivian's lips. She already possessed complete control over Serena.



As long as Serena harbored any dreams of surviving in the entertainment world, the devastating secret of her miscarriage would serve as perfect leverage. At least throughout the entire "Heavenly Melody"competition, it would keep her dancing like a puppet on invisible strings.



If this devastating scandal were to explode across the media landscape, Serena's fanbase would crumble into dust, and her commercial value would evaporate completely-essentially sealing her professional grave forever.



If threats didn't work, she could resort to tempting Serena with benefits to control her.



Vivian's smile radiated pure satisfaction as she contemplated how helping Serena overthrow Millie and claim her rightful place as Charles' official girlfriend would become the ultimate motivation driving her forward.



With this masterful strategy crystallizing in her mind,Vivian felt her tense muscles finally surrender to relaxation.



She cast her gaze toward Johnny, who was methodically executing her carefully crafted orders,and delivered a pointed reminder. "Today, I must emerge as the undisputed champion of the show."


Johnny's head snapped up, his expression clouded with confusion over Vivian's relentless emphasis on this particular point. She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "When it comes to the marketing strategy for Serena, I've developed an entirely different approach."



Vivian drew even nearer to whisper her secret plan directly into Johnny's ear, and he responded with thoughtful nods as understanding dawned across his features.



They exchanged knowing smiles that spoke volumes about their shared conspiracy.



...


Meanwhile, within the sanctuary of Millie's private lounge, Charles had departed to handle pressing business matters, leaving his trusted assistant Barbara to provide attentive care for Millie's needs.


Barbara's fingers scrolled through endless Internet content, her frown carving deeper lines across her forehead with each passing moment.



"How peculiar!" Barbara whispered under her breath,her voice heavy with bewilderment.



Millie, having enjoyed a restorative rest that had breathed life back into her weary body, lfted her head with renewed curiosity. "What's troubling you?" Barbara extended the tablet toward Millie with obvious concern. "I've been analyzing the online data streams.Everyone's engaged in heated debates about which performance reigns supreme-'Glimmer of Love' or 'Yesterday.' But there's something deeply unsettling about the whole situation."



Barbara navigated to the relevant pages with practiced precision. "Why has the broadcast quality deteriorated to such abysmal levels?"


Millie's eyes swept across the screen,and comprehension struck her like a lightning bolt.


Such underhanded tactics were deplorably common in the cutthroat world of showbiz.



But everyone in the industry understood that Charles stood firmly behind her, and he wasn't someone whose patience could be tested lightly due to his volatile temper and swift retribution.


Under normal circumstances, absolutely no one would dare subject her to such treatment or deliberately provoke Charles' wrath, except for someone like Brandon, whose influence towered even above Charles' considerable power.


Therefore, the only person capable of orchestrating this elaborate sabotage was undoubtedly Vivian. Millie's fingers glided through the online commentary surrounding "Glimmer of Love" and "Yesterday,"finding the entire debate utterly absurd.


How could people seriously debate which performance held superiority when both songs had flowed from her own creative soul?



A soft chuckle escaped her lips as she gently placed the tablet aside with amused resignation.



Barbara reclaimed the device with cautious movements, desperately attempting to decipher Serena's emmotional state, but the mysterious mask concealed everything,leaving her to navigate through pure speculation.



After several moments of careful consideration,Barbara ventured a tentative suggestion. "Should we notify Mr. Evans immediately and allow him to handle this situation with his usual efficiency?"



Millie shook her head with quiet determination,knowing Charles' notoriously impatient nature all too well.


He had probably already discovered the situation and was currently plotting his next strategic countermove with calculated precision.



With that thought taking root in her mind,Milliet reached for her phone and dialed his number.


Charles was likely buried deep in demanding business matters and failed to respond instantly.



Just as Millie began to suspect he wouldn't answer at all, the connection finally crackled to life.


"Serena." Charles's familiar voice flowed through the speaker with unmistakable warmth. "What's happening on your end?"


They had forged their understanding that whenever she donned the mask, she would be acknowledged solely as "Serena."


Millie's gaze remained fixed on the live stream interface with unwavering calm as she spoke. "The time has come to dispatch the legal notice."
###Chapter 30 Bring Millie Back
Once "Glimmer of Love" was officially released, the legal notice was already prepped and ready to go at a moment's notice.


Selling a song only transferred the rights to use it. But now,wvith no credit given to Eva at all, the situation had escalated into something far more serious.


A sly chuckle crackled through the line as Charles spoke from the other end. "Great minds think alike. I'm already on it."


"But," interjected Millie, her eyes lowering just a touch."Don't post it online just yet. Send it to Vivian directly."


"Is there a reason for that?" Charles asked.


Millie remained calm as she answered, "A legal notice is meant to notify and warn. It's simply a procedural step."


"Got it," Charles replied, his laugh carrying an edge of understanding.


Sharp minds didn't need anything spelled out.



Charles was known for his short temper, but despite that-and growing up in a family where internal rivalries ran deep enough that both his older brothers had stepped into adulthood long before he did-he had still managed to seize control of Evans Entertainment. That alone proved he was far from reckless or naive.



Both he and Millie were fully aware that Vivian was currently protected by the public's affection for those who seem to be fading away.



If they chose to speak out now, even while defending what was rightfully theirs, the public would likely view them as the ones causing trouble.


The public would rush to defend the delicate,suffering Vivian, accusing Evans Entertainment of taking advantage of Vivian's situation to chase profit.



In the world of business, perception was just as powerful as numbers. A scandal could easily damage a publicly listed company, sending stock prices tumbling-especially with the weight of the larger Evans Group sitting over their heads.


So they needed to act strategically. They couldn't afford to jump too soon, but neither could they afford to stand by and do nothing.



Sending the legal notice to Vivian wasn't just a formality-it was a key move that marked the timeline and secured a documented trail of action, which was crucial for any future proceedings.


Millie couldn't quite figure out what Vivian's true motives were, but one thing was certain-she was not the type to surrender quietly.


After a few more messages were exchanged, Millie finally set her phone down.


But just as her hand left the screen, it buzzed again.


Her eyes locked onto the display. The name "Brandon's Grandpa" lit up in bold, and she pressed her lips together in silence.


For several days now, Brandon's grandparents had been trying to reach her, but she hadn't returned a single call.


She couldn't bring herself to face them, especially not Derek. His health was already fragile, and the entire marriage had started as a way to lift his spirits.


For now, she chose to avoid what she knew couldn't be avoided forever.


With that, she let the call ring out and disappear once more.


"Knock,knock,knock..."


A light tapping came from the lounge door, followed by a staff member's voice calling out, "Miss Ellsworth,all contestants have finished their performances. It's time to head to the stage for the team selection part."



"Alright, thank you," Millie replied politely.



She was just about to stand when her phone buzzed again.


Something felt off this time.


The message had come through on her secondary SIM card.



She glanced down, her eyes scanning the screen as her thoughts drifted.



Beside her, Barbara noticed the sudden stillness and asked, "Serena? Did something happen?"



Millie gave a small shake of her head and said, "It's nothing." She pushed the thoughts aside, pulling herself back into focus, and stood. "Let's go."


With Barbara by her side, she made her way toward the stage.







Up on the top floor of the Watson Group building,things felt wrong the moment Brandon stepped out of the elevator. The air was heavy with tension, and every assistant kept their head down, not a word spoken.



As Eugene pushed open the door to the CEO's office,Brandon walked in-only to have a cane come swinging straight at him.



He reacted on instinct, stepping aside just in time.



"Stay right where you are, you brat!" yelled a voice he knew all too well. Brandon looked up and saw Derek standing in front of him, eyes blazing.



"Grandpa," he said quickly, moving to steady him as Derek's stance wobbled.



But the moment he got close, Derek struck him hard on the arm with the cane.



"So you still know I'm your grandpa?" Derek's chest rose and fell with fury, his hand trembling as he pointed. "Are you trying to send me to an early grave?Weren't you supposed to be at that show for that Vivian woman's performance? Why are you here now?"


As he spoke, Derek motioned furiously at the screen next to him.



Brandon turned his eyes to the screen, which was airing a live broadcast of Heavenly Melody. The team selection segment was underway, and Vivian was in the middle of choosing contestants for her group. "You're still watching!" Derek's voice rang out again,full of scorn.



Brandon looked away from the screen and murmured,"Grandpa..."


When Derek wouldn't even glance at him, Brandon shifted his gaze toward Norma, hoping for some support. "Grandma..."


"Don't bother calling me," she replied sharply, her tone laced with disappointment as she gently tried to calm Derek. "I've stood beside your grandfather for a lifetime, and not once has he taken up with someone else or treated me with disrespect. I truly believed you,after being raised by us, would turn out a decent man and give Millie the same devotion. But it seems I was wrong."


"Grandma..." Brandon said again, his voice softer this time.



Derek snapped, "You should go find Millie." His fury hung heavy in the air. "You're a married man, yet you went to see another woman perform, and the whole thing was streamed live. The Internet's a mess with speculation. Millie must be beside herself with anger."


He pointed his cane directly at Brandon and screamed,"I don't care what it takes-swear an oath, get down on your knees if you have to-just bring her home!" It all unfolded so quickly that the office door hadn't even been shut yet.



Derek's outburst carried through the open space,echoing across the floor and reaching every ear nearby.


Brandon winced as he gripped his arm, still sore from the cane's blow, his lips drawn into a tight line.


"Did Millie come to you complaining?" he asked quietly.





Hearing that only made Derek more furious. Hle lifted the cane again, clearly ready for another strike.


Norma rushed to steady him, knowing how fragile his condition had become. After two angry swings earlier,his face had turned pale, and his knees nearly gave out.



"Grandpa," Brandon said as he stepped forward to help, but Norma brushed his hand away without hesitation.



She waved Eugene over, and then turned her back to Brandon and said, "Your parents weren't around much when you were a child, and we, as your grandparents,probably didn't know what we were doing either. If this is how you turned out, the blame falls on us."
Her voice remained steady, but every word struck deep.





A wave of unease rose in Brandon's chest.



Without glancing at him again, Norma instructed Eugene to guide Derek into the wheelchair and take him to the elevator.


Brandon took another step toward them, but Norma didn't allow it. "If you're set on pushing your grandfather to his grave, then by all means, follow us,"she said. "But don't come see us again unless Millie is with you."


With that, she stepped into the elevator, leaving Brandon behind in complete silence.



Not a single voice rose across the entire floor.



It was as if everyone had been struck mute, their silence thick with tension.


The entire space felt frozen in stillness, the only sound cutting through the air coming from the broadcast playing on the screen.


There, Vivian stood holding a microphone, her expression poised and full of confidence. "Serena,your talent is undeniable, and I truly admire it. If we become a team,I canpromise you a stage that shines.
I'll give it my all to support your journey. So,will you join me?"



Beside her, the host announced excitedly, "And there you have it, folks! Judge Vivian has officially invited Serena. Now, let's see what Serena decides!"


The camera then shifted to Serena, who was dressed in a blazing rose-red stage outfit. She stepped forward,calm and composed, and reached for the microphone handed to her.
###Chapter 31 You Can't Fool Me
Vivian smiled as she looked at the masked woman in front of her.



There was a sharpness behind her gaze.



Before this part started she had sent a message to Serena. "Even if you don't come to me first, I'll still tell you this-Millie signed with Evans Entertainment a year ago. She's been tied to Charles ever since. You lost a child for him, and still, no one knows you're his girlfriend. That has to sting. Join my team. I won't mention your miscarriage, and with the attention we're getting now, I can help you shine. I'll make Charles see you. And Millie? She'll be seen for what she is-a woman who shifts easily and always needs a man to lean on. This isn't a threat, Serena. It's a sincere offer."



Vivian thought the mix of pressure and promises would be enough to sway Serena.


But Millie stood quietly now, watching her, fully aware of how Vivian liked to play games.


Millie turned to the audience and bowed, holding the mic with a calm grace.
Then she looked at the three judges in front of her.



Leonard Happer was thirty-two, a pop singer whose signature love songs filled playlists and radio charts.



Alex Hayes-twenty-eight, rising fast in the alt-pop scene,leading his own band.


And Vivian-twenty-five, famous not for music but for her delicate looks, her floral design business, and her role in promoting Heavenly Melody.


All three had asked her to join their team.



Millie spoke with quiet clarity. "Thank you all for your kind invitations.



Too bad I can only choose one..." she paused,letting the silence stretch just enough. "Based on my music style, and what I hope to learn here, I've decided..."


The judges' seats were arranged in a half-circle-Vivian in the middle, the others on either side.



Millie walked straight ahead.


Vivian's expression relaxed into a self-assured smile,certain she was about to win.



But just before reaching her,Millie turned. She walked toward Alex. "Mr. Hayes," she said, voice calm and respectful,"may I join your team?"



Alex glanced toward Vivian, catching the subtle change in her expression, and then smiled and stood.



"I'd be honored," he said, shaking her hand.



The camera zoomed in on their handshake-while just behind them, Vivian's smile had frozen in place.



Brandon watched it unfold from the screen, frowning slightly.


He could tell Serena had baited Vivian into thinking she'd won. Then, in one clean pivot, she'd handed the moment to someone else.



Why?







The team selection round had the audience completely hooked-some cheered, others groaned in frustration.



Millie, now seated behind Alex as part of his team, sat quietly.


Vivian kept glancing her way, but Millie never looked back. Taping went on for hours, with commercial breaks built in for everyone to rest and regroup.



During one of those breaks, Millie stepped out to use the restroom.



She was barely halfway down the hallway when Vivian stepped in front of her.



"You didn't see my message?" Vivian asked, eyes narrowed.



"I saw it," Millie said calmly.



Vivian grabbed her collar and yanked her to the side."Then why? Why did you humiliate me like that?"


Millie laughed under her breath and peeled Vivian's hand off her clothes.



"I made a choice," she said. "That's all. Between song style and experience, I think Alex is the better fit.I want to stay in the show and growv as much as I can as a musician. That's all there is to it."



Vivian let out a sharp laugh.



"I really tought you'd get it by now. But you still don't," she said. "Do you even know why you lost to Millie? You've never understood the core of it. This world is about marketing. Do you think this show is  just about who sings best? Wake up! It's never about how well you sing or write. It's about image. Evans Entertainment didn't invest in you because they love your talent. They're counting on your market value.Monetization. Do you get that?"


Her words came fast, biting.



"Style? Experience?" Vivian scoffed. "Serena, don't you think you're being a little too pretentious,too self -important?"



Millie looked at her calmly, unaffected. "I don't get it,"she said. "If you really only have six months left, why are you still clinging to all this? Wouldn't it make more sense to just live your life in peace?”



Vivian's eyes flickered for a second, caught off guard.



But she recovered quickly. She couldn't let the truth slip.




So she changed the subject. "You can still switch," she said, stepping closer. "Join my team. Or we can make another deal."



The space between them shrank, the tension settling like a fog.



"I'll give you time to think it through. We're on the same side. We both want the same thing."
With that, Vivian turned and walked off, leaving Millie standing alone.



Millie watched her leave, quiet, unsure what to make of it.



Vivian already had Brandon. He was right there beside her.





So why the games?


What was she trying to prove?



And why direct it all at her?







The hours passed quickly. The taping stretched from morning to night.


By the time it wrapped up, everyone was running on fumes.



The sky outside had darkened.


Millie walked slowly, supported by Charles. She was too weak to stand on her own.



Charles looked at her and let out a deep sigh.


He had told her to rest, tried to talk her out of pushing herself too far. But Millie had insisted. She wanted to grow stronger. She needed to. It was the only way she could regain control of her life.



As they rounded the corner toward the waiting vehicle,Millie noticed someone standing by the car.



Brandon.


She glanced at Charles, who shook his head-this wasn't something he had arranged.


Brandon spoke first. "Can we talk?"


Charles looked like he was about to say no, but Millie gently pressed his arm. Then she straightened up and gestured for Brandon to follow her into the nearby grove of trees.


Once there, she turned and said, "What do you want to talk about, Mr. Watson?"


The sound of her voice caught Brandon off guard.It stirred something in his memory-too familiar to ignore.


He looked at her more closely.


She wore a long coat over her performance outfit,but her frame was slight, unmistakably so.


Of all the women he had ever known, not one had a body quite like hers.
He searched her masked face, and then asked directly,"Why did you mislead Vivian during the selection earlier?"



Millie let out a dry laugh.


"Mislead her?" she said. "I didn't mislead anyone."


Brandon's brow creased. "Don't pretend. I know what you did. You can't fool me."


Millie pressed her lips together and turned away.



It was the same tone.



The same look he had given her all those years ago -when her stepfather had hit her, and she came to school trying to hide it. He had pulled her aside then and said, "Millie, do you even know what you look like right now? Stop lying. You can't fool me."


But this time, the words came from across a line. Not of care. But of suspicion. He wasn't standing beside her anymore.
###Chapter 32 They Had Spent The Night Together The D...
The wind raced through the trees and carried echoes that felt like old memories refusing to let go.



A handful of leaves drifted down, barely touching the earth.Brandon,growing impatient with Millie's silence,pressed her for an answer. "Come on. I asked you a question."



Millie fixed her eyes on Brandon's shadow stretching out along the ground. "You really ought to ask Vivian about what she said to me."



A hint of doubt crept into Brandon's expression."Vivian has never even met you before."



He meant that she was inventing stories.



Millie raised her head and met his gaze. "Mr. Watson,do you truly put all your faith in her?"


For a moment, Brandon was quiet, but that old,strange feeling stirred in him once again.


She added, "There's nothing for me to gain by going after Vivian. She's important to you, and with your influence in Crobert, someone like me could never match up."



A gentle smile played on her lips. "If nothing really happened, why would I put myself in such a difficult position for no reason at all?"


Brandon's frown grew more pronounced.


He realized her argument actually had weight.


Still, what possible motive would Vivian-a woman facing only six months to live-have for going after a stranger?



Deep down, his loyalty remained with Vivian.


He finally spoke. "Whatever happened between you two, Serena, I just want you to remember one thing.She only has six months left. She joined this program to encourage people who are fighting the same battle."


Millie took in Brandon's furrowed brow, his intense eyes, and the certainty in his voice. Her mind wandered back to Vivian's words from earlier that day.



"This world is about marketing. Do you think this show is just about who sings best? Wake up! It's never about how well you sing or write. It's about image.Evans Entertainment didn't invest in you because they love your talent. They're counting on your market value.Monetization. Do you get that?" Millie could not tell if Vivian was really that good and had managed to fool Brandon, or if he simply wanted to put his trust in her.


She felt lost, and she had no desire to start guessing.



She looked away, her eyes searching for anything else.


"Not everything turns out as perfect as it looks.Sometimes, what you think is wonderful ends up being far from it." Those words were the last advice she chose to give.


Brandon's gaze grew sharper and colder.


She seemed to read him as easily as a book.



From the moment she invited him into the woods,through every question and reply, up to her latest words-she acted as though every bit of his doubt and hesitation was right there in plain view, every thought exposed.



She appeared able to shape the way he thought,even nudging his decisions.


No one but a person who understood him down to the core would be capable of that.


He studied her and said, "Tell me, who are you,really?"


Right then, her mask felt painfully annoying, like it did not belong.


He stretched out his hand, intent on removing it.



Without thinking, Millie moved away, but her high heels dug into the soft ground, making her lose her balance.



Brandon reached out without hesitation and caught her by the arm.


Lightning tore open the sky, and thunder quickly followed,rolling through the trees.


A flash illuminated the groves, and as Millie fought to regain her balance, her long coat slid down her shoulders.


He kept his grip on her slim arm, the sudden light showing fresh bruises on her delicate skin, far worse than what he had noticed on stage.



Thunder came late and loud, the sound crashing through the woods and pounding in Brandon's chest.


Somewhere in his memories, there lingered an image of someone bearing those same painful marks.



It had been Millie, seven years earlier.



Those eyes filled with pain from years ago still appeared clear in his mind, as if time had never moved at all.



"You..." Brandon remarked, but she had already slipped her arm from his grasp.



She pulled her coat up over her shoulders and regained her balance. "Thank you, Mr. Watson."


That formal address jolted him back to the present.


Millie had never called him anything except "Brandon."



Yet, the woman standing before him appeared far more frail than Millie ever had.



Everyone knew she belonged to Charles. Just ten days earlier, she had lost his child.


He recalled how he and Millie had been at the courthouse six days ago. The night before, they had even spent the night together.



That meant it could not be Millie in front of him.



Meanwhile, Charles was already making his way over,clearly sensing that something was off.


Brandon could not hold back any longer. "Charles let you join a reality show even when you're this hurt?"


The words left his mouth before he could stop them.


"That doesn't concern you, Mr. Watson," Millie replied, her tone cold and distant.


Brandon's frown deepened, and he wanted to continue,but Charles stepped in.


Suddenly, dizziness overwhelmed Millie, and she leaned against Charles for support.



"Mil-My God! Serena!" Charles called out, worry filling his voice as he caught her, then threw a glare in Brandon's direction.


Charles seemed ready to confront him, but Millie stopped him with a look.


Brandon pressed his lips together, watching them stand side by side, unable to hide his frustration.


He remarked, "If she's this badly hurt,why would you let her go on working?"



Charles gave him an exasperated look.


He could not believe Brandon would even ask. After all, those injuries had been caused by Brandon in the first place.


Charles remembered how, during his hospital visit,Alexia had filled him in on all the details.


Millie had only received a mild concussion from the car accident. If she had stayed in bed and rested, she
might not have lost the baby.


It had been Brandon who shoved Millie down the stairs later, all because he wanted to shield Vivian.



Now the child was gone, and Millie's body was covered in bruises. In truth, she was fortunate nothing had been broken.



If only Brandon had not insisted on stopping MMillie for a conversation, they might have returned to the car without any trouble.



Who was he to say anything now?



Charles could barely hold back from letting loose on Brandon, ready to show him why he was known as Crobert's most hot-tempered man.



But after noticing how uneasy Millie looked, he just blurted out, "Why don't you mind your own business?!"


He gathered her in his arms and carried her straight back to the waitingg car.



Brandon stood there with a heavy frown, watching as they disappeared. The way Millie'shair draped across Charles' arm sent a sharp pang of jealousy through him.



Wind swept through the area, carrying more leaves to the ground. One floated gently into Brandon's open hand.
He glanced down at the leaf resting in his palm



Millie's words stayed with him, curling in the corers of histhoughts. She had spoken with a calm certainty hinting that what looked promising at first glance offen carried a weight it didn't show


Was she right about that?


While he was still thinking it over, raindrops started falling from the sky.


Drops splashed onto the leaf he held,each one falling like silent tears.

Charles and Millie rode in the car for a while,and then changed vehicles to head to the hospital

Millie, feoling a bit stronger, turned to look out the window


Charles continued to grumble under his breath about Brandon,but Milie could not bring herself to care anymore.


Brandon's place in Crobert was far too powerful. No matter how much Charles wanted to help, they could never challonge him.


So why keep struggling?


She decided to focus on what little she had and to work toward her own goals. That alone would have to be enough.



Her phone started to vibrate once more.



A glance at her screen showed a new message from Brandon.







Rain poured from the sky in thick sheets.


When the show ended, people scattered quickly, each heading home in a different direction.


To keep the broadcast smooth, the audience had not been allowed to bring any electronic devices.


For that reason, nobody could check their phones until the recording had finished.


Throughout the day, Heavenly Melody was trending online, so when the crowd finally checked their phones,they caught up on all the latest buzz.


Most people were only there to see the drama unfold,but a few began to ask questions.



Why did clips of Serena's performance online seemed so mediocre than it actually did during the live performance?
###Chapter 33 His Vows
As more people began sharing videos across social media platforms, a heated debate started brewing beneath the surface.



A user named Seville stepped into the conversation with his own take on the night. "I witnessed it firsthand,and honestly, the standout performance had to be 'Yesterday.' Both the song selection and the singer's polished delivery were absolutely flawless-without question, it became the evening's crowning moment.But now, scrolling through these live stream highlights,it appears surprisingly mediocre. Something feels off."


Another user, Fray, jumped into the conversation with enthusiasm. "I stood right there in that crowd too.When I walked out, I craved nothing more than to experience those magical moments again,but what they uploaded online bore no resemblance to what my eyes actually witnessed. Did the live stream malfunction somehow?"



Seville's curiosity peaked as he responded, "I have no clue. Did anyone else catch this strange discrepancy?"


This simple question ignited a wildfire of discussion in the comment threads that followed. "You two must be absolutely devoted fans of Serena.I believe the most stunning performance belonged to 'Glimmer of Love'!"



"Absolutely right. 'Yesterday' delivered solid entertainment, but it cannot compare to the raw power of 'Glimmer of Love.' Besides, Vivian isn't even a trained professional vocalist, so her performance carries even deeper significance!"


"Exactly my thoughts. Vivian possesses the mind of a true artistic genius!"


"Listen, Seville, I also appreciate the musical style of 'Yesterday,' but there's really no reason to insist it surpassed everything else. Both songs offered their own unique brilliance. Why must 'Yesterday'necessarily eclipse 'Glimmer of Love'?"


Seville felt compelled to clarify his position once more. "I'm not pushing any agenda here-I'm simply making an observation. I genuinely enjoyed both 'Glimmer of Love' and 'Yesterday,' but truthfully,experiencing it live, 'Yesterday' delivered far more emotional impact, especially during that breathtaking final violin solo. It was absolutely mesmerizing, and the highlight reel failedto capture even a fraction of that performance!"

 
"All right,Seville, we understand your position-you're clearly a devoted Serena fan. Stop attempting to manipulate the narrative. Do you honestly believe the entire Internet can't see through this obvious bias? Are you the only person who possesses the real truth?"



At first, Seville had simply posed an honest question,but being confronted so aggressively made him plant his feet firmly and fight back.



He crafted an extensive post, meticulously analyzing every detail-stage design, lighting techniques,sound engineering quality, and numerous other technical aspects-and fired it back into the thread.



After hitting submit, he kept refreshing obsessively,waiting for responses, but nobody seemed to engage with his detailed analysis.


Looking back at the thread, he discovered his comments had vanished completely.


Scrolling frantically through the entire discussion,he realized all his previous contributions had disappeared too.



Content moderation? But he hadn't written anything remotely offensive or inappropriate. He was simply asking legitimate questions! What possible justification could there be for such action?



Seville then navigated to his private messages and reached out to Fray, the other attendee who had shared his concerns about the livestream quality.
He typed carefully. "Hello, I was present at the live show for 'Heavenly Melody.' All my comments have mysteriously disappeared. Did the same thing happen to your posts?"


But the moment he clicked send, a notification flashed across his screen, informing him that he had violated the platform's community guidelines and was now suspended for seven full days.


Visiting Fray's user profile with growing dread, he saw that Fray had also been handed a seven-day suspension.


Previously,Seville had experienced only mild irritation at the situation, but now white-hot rage coursed through his veins.


This represented nothing short of pure intimidation.Wasn't this simply a calculated effort to silence opposing voices?


The widespread silence suddenly made perfect sense -everyone had been effectively muzzled through intimidation.



However,Seville possessed the tenacity of someone who refused to surrender without resistance. He swiftly accessed a secondary account, mobilized his network of contacts, and launched a targeted campaign with the hashtag-#YesterdayLiveSound-
determined to amplify the suppressed voices.


As the digital movement began gathering momentum across social platforms, Millie found herself staring at a message that had materialized on her phone screen from Brandon. "My grandfather's condition has deteriorated significantly. He's requesting to see you."


Millie's fingers tightened around her phone until her knuckles turned white, and Derek's increasingly frail silhouette materialized in her mind's eye.


She recalled with painful clarity that Brandon's original motivation for marrying her had been to lift Derek's spirits during his declining years.


That pivotal day remained etched in her memory-the two of them positioned beside his hospital bed while machines hummed softly in the background. Brandon had clasped her hand with gentle determination and announced, "Grandpa, I've brought Millie to visit you.We're planning to get married soon."


Despite Derek's weakening physical state, he had summoned enough strength to point a trembling finger at Brandon and declare, "If your feelings aren't genuine, don't squander her precious years.I refuse to accept sacrifices made solely for my momentary happiness!"

 
The Watson family's meteoric ascent had originated when Derek first ventured into the business world decades earlier. He had become the unwavering foundation upon which the entire Watson Empire was constructed.



When Derek spoke, every family member and business associate listened with reverent attention.



How could anyone witness such selfless concern without feeling deeply moved?



That sacred day, Brandon had made a solemn vow at Derek's bedside, swearing that his love was authentic and promising to cherish Millie throughout their shared lifetime. But circumstances had shifted dramatically since then.



At last, Millie squeezed her eyes shut and let the weight of reality settle over her shoulders.


Time had proven itself a relentless force of transformation.



Brandon had already initiated divorce proceedings, and they had made their obligatory appearance at the courthouse together just days before.



Concealing the news from Derek represented the maximum extent of protection she could provide.


There existed no additional actions she could take,nor any she possessed the emotional strength to attempt.
With that sobering realization settling over her,Millie closed the chat application with finality.



Across the sprawling city, Brandon remained frozen in the plush leather seat of his midnight-black Bentley,his eyes fixed on the message he had transmitted with mounting desperation.


Three excruciating minutes had elapsed since sending it.





Millie's response remained conspicuously absent from his screen.



Brandon scrolled upward through their conversation history and experienced a jarring realization-the last time she had initiated contact was before their courthouse appointment.



He directed his attention toward the rain cascading down the window glass in intricate patterns.



When had their paths last crossed in the physical realm?



It seemed like approximately three days ago during that tense encounter at the hospital.



Her forehead had been swathed in stark white medical bandages. During the entire agonizing time,she had only spoken three brief things to him.
"What are you doing?!"



"What happened?"



And as he prepared to leave with Vivian, she had called out with unexpected urgency-"Brandon."



Those initial two utterances hadn't even been directed specifically toward him.



For inexplicable reasons, he discovered himself yearning for her presence with unexpected intensity.


The image of her tumbling down those unforgiving stairs replayed in his mind, and he found himself genuinely concerned about her current condition and recovery.



His brow creased with concern as troubling thoughts invaded his mind.



Brandon couldn't comprehend what mysterious force was affecting his usual emotional equilibrium.



Millie had haunted his thoughts with persistent tenacity throughout every waking moment of the day.


A vivid recollection suddenly blazed across his consciousness-the enigmatic masked woman from earlier that evening.



Perhaps she had triggered this emotional upheaval  within him.

Something indefinable about her had evoked memories of the Millie he once cherished-vibrant,passionate, always expressing herself through laughter or tears.



At that precise moment, a series of rhythmic knocks resonated against the car window.



Brandon lifted his gaze and discovered Vivian standing outside in the rain, her silhouette blurred by the water streaming down the glass.


"Hey there, Brandon!" Vivian wrenched open the car door and slipped gracefully into the seat positioned beside him.



Instinctively, Brandon concealed his phone from her penetrating gaze, sliding it away with practiced stealth.


Vivian's eyes tracked the movement briefly, though she appeared to dismiss it as inconsequential, but as she pivoted to close the door behind her, a flicker of resentment darkened her expression.



When she faced him again, her features had transformed into a mask of radiant warmth.



She inquired with gentle concern, "DidI inconvenience you by requesting this ride? Have you been waiting here for long?"
"Not particularly lengthy," Brandon responded with measured neutrality.


"That brings me considerable relief," Vivian replied.her smile never wavering.


The driver engaged the engine, propelling them through the rain-soaked streets of the city.


Vivian began recounting entertaining anecdotes from the recording session, but Brandon's attention drifted like smoke,barely registering her animated storytelling.


His consciousness remained fixated on the masked woman's provocative words, which echoed relentlessly. "You really ought to ask Vivian about what she said to me."



"Brandon? Brandon?" Vivian's voice cut through his mental fog.


Brandon jolted back to the present moment, his focus returning to the car's interior.


He turned toward Vivian, his expression clearly indicating that she should continue with her narrative.


"What thoughts were consuming your attention?"Vivian asked, her tone laced with curious concern."You've appeared completely absorbed in your own world for quite some time now."
Brandon studied Vivian's delicate features-porcelain pale, fragile, and almost heartbreakingly vulnerable.


Finally, he posed the question that had been searing through his mind."What precisely did you say to Serena during the recording?"
###Chapter 34 Did She Take It The Wrong Way
As Brandon questioned Vivian in the Bentley,something else was brewing online-conversations about the live sound quality of "Yesterday" had started trending.


Vivian's team caught it quickly.


Johnny frowned as he read through the comments,uneasy.



He typed a message to Vivian. "We tried flagging the accounts at first, but they knew how to play the system. They just switched to new ones and brought in more people to psh the trend. It's already gained attention. If we start mass-reporting now, it'll only look like we're hiding something. What do you think we should do? I've listed a few options..."



That was how their team usually worked-Johnny came up with the possible moves, and Vivian picked the one that fit her image best.


Not long after, Vivian made her choice.



Elsewhere, Seville scrolled through the trending thread,pleased with how fast it had spread.

It was easy to shut things down when only a few people were talking. But what happened when the numbers kept growing?



He knew this crowd-curious, nosy,always hungry for drama. He was waiting for someone to bring the truth forward.



But then, the conversation began to twist.



"You keep talking, but where's the proof?"


"Exactly. If there's no evidence, it's just noise. Rumors are easily spread these days."


"This is clearly a Serena fan trying to pull Vivian down.They just want 'Yesterday' to outshine 'Glimmer of Love.' It's pathetic."


"| used to like Serena. But if this is how her fans act,she's lost me."



"This feels like a PR stunt. Probably Serena's team stirring things on purpose."



"Vivian came on this show to inspire people who are suffering, to give them hope. And now she's getting attacked for being kind?"



"Whoever's doing this has no conscience. Vivian's not even part of the competition, and still she's being
dragged through the mud. It's just cruel."



Heavenly Melody was alroady a hit show. Add in the emotional weight of Vivian's illnoss, and paopla ward ready to defend hor at all costs.



With everyone fooling for Vivian and no solid footage from the live show to say othorwisa, tho crowd naturally leaned in her favor.



Seville sat back, stunned. This wasn't what he'd expected.





He hadn't even mentioned Vivian when he first questioned the audio quality.


He had just noticed that the online clips didn't sound like what he heard in person. But now? Now he was being labeled Serena's obsessed fan, hell-bent on destroying Vivian's image.



As more voices poured in, the direction of public opinion began to take shape.



Seville was frustrated.



He wanted to explain he'd never even heard the name Serena Ellsworth until today. She was new in the industry and wore a mask throughout the show.



How did he suddenly become her die-hard fan in everyone's story?
And to make things worse, he had always liked Vivian and thought her performance was equally beautiful.He never had anything against her.


"This is insane," he muttered. "I can't let it go. They want proof? Fine. I don't believe for a second that out of all those people at the venue, not one person secretly recorded something."


He stood up,already scrolling through his contacts. He wasn't the type to sit quietly and watch.



He decided to make a call.



He dialed one of his friends who had also been at the event.



After a few moments of small talk, Seville casually asked him about his opinion on the stage performance.



His friend replied, "Honestly? I thought 'Yesterday'sounded amazing live. But when I watched the clips online later, it didn't hit the same."



Once they were sure they were on the same page,Seville shared everything. "Taylor, you know how l am.I can't just let this slide," he said. "What I said online was true, but now they're calling me a Serena obsessed fan trying to attack Vivian. I'm not okay with that. You helped me get in, so l figured  you might have a way. If no one's uploaded footage from the  live event yet, maybe there's a group chat or something? Somewhere people shared clips or talked during the show?"



His friend thought for a moment, and then finally added him to a chat group. "This is my ticket resale group," he warned. "It's full of all kinds of people-some are legit, some aren't. Be careful. Don't say anything that could get the group shut down."


"Thanks, I owe you one," Seville said, already planning his next move.




...


Inside the Bentley, Vivian was caught off guard by Brandon's question.



"I don't understand," she said, eyebrows pulling together.


Brandon looked at her, quiet. The silence made it hard for her to meet his eyes.



Vivian looked down, pausing to think.



"I really don't know what you mean, Brandon," she said,voice soft. "I did speak to her."



She glanced up again, her expression delicate, almnost unsure. "I heard she'd had a miscarriage recently and that she was still recovering. I just wanted to check on her-to see if she needed anything."



She blinked, trying to read his face.



"Did she take it the wrong way?" she said, worriedly trying to remember. "I only mentioned her injuries and her... loss. Brandon, do you think she thought I was the one who told people? That's not what I meant at all."Vivian lifted her hand to her face, looking distressed."I only ever told you. No one else."



Brandon studied her closely. Everything she said made sense.



Her face, her voice-it all fit.



She looked genuinely regretful. Without waiting for him to speak, she pulled out her phone and typed a message to Serena, as if to prove her sincerity.


Maybe it really was a misunderstanding.


"It's fine," Brandon said. "I was just asking."


To him,there was Vivian-the woman he'd once failed and still felt responsible for-and Serena, Charles 'rumored lover who had absolutely nothing to do with him.There was no need to push further.


Rain brushed lightly against the windows. The city outside looked hazy, the damp air making everything feel heavier.
They rode in silence for a while.



Then Vivian broke it. "Brandon," she said softly,"did you think I sang well today?"



She did. But not as well as Serena.



That was his honest thought.



Still, instead of being completely honest, he just gave a short, low hum. "Mm."



Vivian smiled at that. Then her smile trembled just slightly



"With your approval," she said quietly, eyes glistening,"I can leave without regrets."



Brandon's brow tightened.



He turned slightly, and then sighed.


"Don't talk like that," he said. "Vivian, you're already remarkable."



Vivian reached out and took his hand. She didn't say anything more-just held it and smiled gently.


Soon,they pulled up to Vivian Floral Design. Brandon walked her inside, helped her settle in, and returned to the car.
"Mr.Watson,where to next?" Eugene asked.



Brandon didn't answer immediately. He was still watching Vivian through the window. His index finger tapped against the armrest.


Then he said, "Send a message. Tell Macauley to come see me."



"Got it," Eugene replied, pulling out his phone.



The engine hummed back to life, and the car pulled away towards the Watson Group.


But a moment later, his face went pale. Sir-something's wrong. Macauley's missing."


Brandon turned sharply. "Missing? Since when?"


"It was just reported," Eugene said, voice quick and nervous. "They say he disappeared a month ago. The team hid it from us, believing they could track him down before anyone noticed. We only found out because someone asked the right question."



He hesitated and then added, "After everything that happened, Macauley holds a deep grudge. He went back to his hometown, but life hasn't been good for him.If this turns into something serious..."
###Chapter 35 Get A Copy Of The Footage She Filmed
Eugene's anxiety was beginning to show.



He had watched everything unfold,remembering how Macauley, who used to be the head of procurement in the Watson Group, landed in so much trouble after that event.



Holding the position of procurement manager came with plenty of benefits, especially for someone who led the Watson Group's procurement team.


As Eugene mulled it over, he turned to Brandon. "Mr.Watson, do you think we should bring in some bodyguards? And maybe let Miss Simpson know as well?"



Brandon pressed his fingers to his temples and gave a nod, telling Eugene to take care of it.


Just the thought of Macauley brought a dangerous glint to Brandon's eyes.



There was no way Brandon would let Macauley get away with what he had done.

Meanwhile, at the hospital, Millie had taken off her makeup and settled back onto the bed.



Alexia arrived not long after to visit her.



"Millie, you were fantastic tonight!" Alexia grinned as she grabbed Millie's arm. "That performance really blew everyone away!"



"Was it really that much?" Millie asked, watching Alexia's animated face with a small laugh. "I have a feeling you might be biased since you're my best friend."



Alexia scooted closer, refusing to agree. "No, I'm serious! We've known each other since we were kids.I know exactly what you can do. I didn't even bother with those edited clips online; my friend who works on the show streamed it to me live. It's a shame the official recording didn't catch everything, but maybe she managed to save it."



Alexia's excitement kept growing. "When I was just a little girl playing around with my brother, you were already practicing piano and violin every day.Eventually, you picked up all sorts of other instruments too, and all of it just for fun. Mr. Bennett started grooming you early on to take over the family one day. Back then..."



Her words trailed off as she paused.
A small crack appeared in Millie's smile, though her face barely changed.



Thinking of her father's death always struck a nerve and brought all the chaos back to the surface.



"Millie, I'm sorry. I didn't-" Alexia squeezed Millie's hand even tighter.


Millie noticed the worry in her friend's eyes and quickly tried to put her at ease. "You don't have to tiptoe around me. I'm not made of glass, and besides,it's all in the past now. I'm doing well now, don't you think?"



She gave Alexia's hand a reassuring squeeze.



The sincerity in Millie's look finally helped Alexia to relax.





After a brief pause, Alexia spoke up again. "And what about her? How is she these days?"



Millie lifted her gaze and caught the careful way Alexia looked at her.



When the conversation turned so delicate, there could only be one person they meant-Millie's mother.



After her father was gone, a swarm of opportunists had tried to strip away everything Millie and her
mother owned.



Even though Brandon had announced that they were under the Watson family's protection and even let the Watson Group oversee the remaining Bennett family fortune, things never came easy for them.


In her younger days, Millie's mother had turned heads across Crobert with her beauty and grace on the dance floor.


Later on, though, the years caught up with her,and exhaustion replaced her shine.


She went searching for someone to lean on, which eventually led her to marry Millie's stepfather.


Alexia's worried tone broke through the heavy silence."Millie..."


Shifting her focus to the TV, Millie replied, "We haven't really talked lately. The last time I saw her.I gave her some money. I heard she rented a shop and started a small business, so I think she's doing fine."


Deep down, Millie understood that her mother's feelings toward her had only grown more complicated over the years-especially after what happened that year.


Alexia let out a sigh. "Maybe it's best if you both keep your distance for now."
"Maybe you're right," Millie answered in a gentle voice.


A hint of uncertainty lingered.


Turning her eyes back to the television, Millie watched as the weather forecast scrolled across the screen."Attention, everyone! Heavy rain is on the way tonight,so remember to bring your umbrellas if you're heading out..."



Next to her, Alexia began to complain about how hard it would be to get home in the storm.



A laugh escaped Millie. "Why not just stay over tonight? There's no need to rush back in this weather."


They used to share a bed often when they were little girls.



Alexia shot her a playful look. "Forget it. If l accidentally crush you,someone's going to lecture me."


Millie's laughter bubbled up again, though she did not answer,fully aware that Alexia meant Giffard.


Alexia had teased about giving Giffard to her as an apology, but Millie's focus had shifted to more pressing matters.



There was so much waiting for her attention now.


 
Six days earlier, when she Brandon filed for the divorce, she had handed him a property settlement that contained a deliberate loophole.



The document clearly said her belongings would stay with her, and she would take them awvay.



Since Brandon was planning to remarry in half a year and felt provoked that day, he barely bothered to study the agreement carefully.



He missed the detail that, along with several specific items, there was a catchall phrase-"Other assets originally under Millie Bennett's name," which included properties from the Bennett family that the Watson Group had absorbed.



She would not give up her father's legacy, even if nearly all the former Bennett Group employees had moved on.



The vague wording meant it would take negotiation if Brandon chose not to hand it over freely.



After being merged into the Watson Group, the department had always been separate from the company's core. Millie believed that with the right offer,she could get it back.


And if Brandon refused to budge, she was ready to use the contract to fight for her share, determined to win back at least part of what belonged to her. To make this happen, she would need a significant amount of money.



Knowing how sharp Brandon was in business, Millie realized such opportunities might never come again.



That was why staying on the show Heavenly Melody mattered so much to her.



This show's publicity, her musical background, and the songs she presented here would all raise her value in the industry.



New streams of income seemed almost guaranteed if everything went smoothly.



Even if Brandon tried to shut her out, there were still other possibilities to consider, especially since Charles was backing her.



Still, Millie wondered if Brandon would really go that far.



Her eyes fell to the floor. She recalled how guarded Brandon became any timne Vivian was involved.


Because she could not predict his next move,Millie made sure she was prepared for anything.



She understood that Charles had already put everything on the line. His two older brothers had long secured their places at Evans Group,making it harder for Charles to gain a foothold because he was the youngest.



Now that Napier Evans, the current Evans patriarch,was growing older and battling poor health, the three Evans brothers were locked in a fierce fight for power within the company.



If Charles managed to succeed alongside her, the two of them might finally tip the scales and help him rise in the Evans Group.



This thought brought MMillie's focus back to Alexia, who was absentmindedly switching through TV channels.



"Alexia, do you think you can reach out to your friend who streamed the show for you?" she asked.


Alexia kept flipping through, still unimpressed by what she saw. "Sure, what do you need her to do?"



Eyes on the television, Millie answered in a quiet tone,"I'd like to get a copy of the footage she filmed."
###Chapter 36 The Police Came To Learn About Th...
Alexia put down the remote and looked over at Millie,confused. "Why don't you just ask Charles directly?Isn't Evans Entertainment one of the sponsors for the show? I'm sure they have access to the live recordings."


Millie had already tried that-on their way back to the hospital, she'd brought it up with Charles. But the moment she mentioned it, he was fuming.


"I already went after them for that," Charles had snapped from the driver's seat. "I gave them a proper warning, made it clear they crossed the line.They said someone from Brandon's side sent threats. And if that wasn't enough, Oakley started stirring things too.Complete madness."


He slapped his hand hard against the steering wheel."That idiot told our father I've been keeping a woman on the side! Said I'm dragging Evans Group into a fight with Brandon just because of her. I got chewed out like a kid."


In short, Charles' second brother-Oakley Evans-was also knee-deep in it. Like always, Oakley enjoyed causing trouble and watching Charles for a mistake.
It left Charles with no room to act openly. He had to move carefully or Oakley would turn even the smallest thing into a scandal.


After dropping Millie off at the hospital, Charles tried to reassure her. He told her things would settle down,that Evans Entertainment was still under his control.As long as that stayed patient, things would work out eventually.


He just needed time to handle it all quietly.


Now, hearing that someone might've recorded the original live show, Millie was eager to get a copy to spare Charles some trouble.



She told Alexia her plan, and without hesitation,Alexia pulled out her phone to contact her friend.



.··


Time passed quickly, and morning arrived before anyone realized.


The air smelled clean and sharp, washed by the rain from the night before. There was still the scent of wet earth and fresh grass outside.



That morning, Alexia dropped off breakfast for Millie,said a few quick words, and rushed off to work.
Not long after, there was a knock at the door. Millie glanced up, expecting Alexia to have come back with the video. But instead, two police officers stepped inside.



A woman introduced herself as Officer Lynda Owen,with a man beside her who seemed to be her partner on the case.



"Sorry to bother you," Lynda said.


Millie tried to get up from bed, but they quickly motioned for her to stay seated.


"We just wanted to follow up on the statement you gave us earlier. We've made some progress and have a few more questions," Lynda said, her voice calm but serious.



Millie nodded and gave her full attention.



"The black Santana that hit you-we found it," Lynda said. "Turns out, it was a stolen vehicle. The driver was completely covered. Surveillance only picked up a person in disguise. No face, no details." She paused,her tone darkening.



"Whoever it was knew what they were doing. No trace left behind. No slip-ups. They avoided every camera."



Lynda looked at her steadily. "This person could be a professional. We can't rule out the possibility that it was a hired hit."



She looked at Millie and said, "Take a moment and really think-have you ever gotten in someone's way,someone who might still be holding on to it?"


Millie stiffened. A hired hit?



She heard the weight in Lynda's voice and felt her mind drift, quietly pulling up memory after memory.


It was the first time anyone had tried to kill her so directly.


And the timing-it wasn't random. It had to be tied to everything that was happening now.


Her mind immediately went to the divorce.



If that was the trigger, there were two people who came to mind-Brandon and Vivian.


Then she thought about how much the story had changed online.


People were talking about Vivian's illness, her relationship with Brandon. And Millie's name-Brandon's official wife-had resurfaced because of it.



The Internet had quickly dug up her past, including her background as the Bennett family's only heiress.
Once, Brandon had protected her and her mother.But now, with the public fixated on his relationship with Vivian, it was easy to believe that protection was gone.And some people might finally feel free to act.


There was also the matter of Brandon's enemies-people who might target her to get to him. When he took over the reins of Watson Group, he didn't just inherit a powerful company-he inherited resentment.


And then there were other things, smaller on the surface but still strange. Like Macauley Valdez. The former procurement manager had been abruptly fired nearly a year ago.


It was around the time she and Brandon got married,and she remembered the whole thing didn't end up well.



Millie still remembered bumping into Macauley that day. His look had been mysterious-dry amusement mixed with something sharper.


He'd looked Brandon straight in the eye and said,"Brandon, this is your wife?"


The tone was off. Their marriage wasn't private.Everyone at Watson Group knew who she was.


She'd been showing up regularly by Brandon's side for years, especially after graduation. There was no way Macauley, as a department head, didn't know her.Which meant something else was going on.



She'd asked Brandon about it back then. He had shut the conversation down before she could finish her sentence.



Now, sitting across from the police, Millie shared everything she remembered, hoping they'd be able to get to the bottom of it.


After noting everything down, the officers got ready to leave. Just before stepping out, Lynda turned back."By the way, your car's been repaired," she said."You can pick it up when you're feeling better."


Millie nodded. "Thank you, officer."



The moment they returned to the station, the team began sorting through the case.


They placed photos of everyone involved-Brandon,Vivian,Macauley-on a board and jotted down details.


"These are all potential suspects. Do we start questioning them?" one officer asked. "Should we begin with the husband?"



Lynda thought back to the day she had used Millie's phone to call Brandon, and how he hadn't picked up."They're all too close to each other," she said after a moment. "This has to be handled carefully." The officer who had visited the hospital with her nodded. "It's indeed strange. His wife was in a hit-and -run, and instead of checking on her, he was with another woman.Ignored every call."


Another officer passed over a report. "Just came in-Brandon and Millie are getting divorced."


The room went quiet for a moment.


It wasn't the first time they'd handled a case where a man hurt his wife just to be with his lover, or where both the husband and the lover were involved.



After going back and forth, the team leader finally said, "We'll go by the book. At some point,we'll have to talk to Brandon. But we also need to keep our eyes open-he might not be the only one with a reason to want her gone. The connections here are tangled, and the lack of physical evidence makes it harder. We'll need tact-and pressure," he said, turning to Lynda."You'll take the lead. Decide how to approach them,who we speak to first, and how we gather what we need."

Lynda stood up."Got it."


At that moment, across the city, Brandon arrived at the hospital.
His grandfather, Derek, had been admitted the day before.



Brandon had tried visiting a few times, but Norma,furious on Derek's behalf, had sent him away every time.



Now, finally,he'd heard that she'd stepped out to rest at a nearby hotel. This was his chance.


He pushed the door open slowly. Derek lay in bed.fast asleep.



The caregiver was struggling to turn him and clean his back. Despite the movement, Derek didn't stir.



His condition was clearly worsening.


Without warning, Millie's face flashed	across Brandon's mind.



He remembered the quiet way she had cared for Derek during his last round of illness.


The caregiver lost grip and almost dropped Derek.Brandon stepped in without thinking.


Derek wasn't light-lifting him took effort.



Again, he thought of Millie. Of her small hands, her slight frame. How she never said anything, just handled it all quietly.
###Chapter 37 Should He Pay Her A Visit
"I'm sorry, Mr. Watson. I couldn't keep him still," said the caregiver, her voice edged with worry as she glanced at Brandon.



With a quick, dismissive wave, Brandon motioned for her to step back and carefully rolled Derek over.


"I'll handle it," said Brandon, gently taking the towel from her hands so he could clean Derek himself.



She brought in a basin filled with water, and then slipped out of the VIP hospital room, leaving Brandon alone with Derek.



Brandon finished wiping Derek's back, and then positioned him onto his other side once again.


Derek remained completely unconscious, unable to help at all, so moving his solid frame proved to be a bit of a struggle even for a grown man like Brandon.


Having gotten Derek onto his back, Brandon focused on cleaning the front.



Only when he dipped the towel back into the basin did Brandon notice the water had grown cold. That meant he needed to fetch a fresh basin of hot water from the bathroom.



He carried on this way, repeating each step, until Derek was finally clean.



The entire process lasted nearly half an hour.


By the time he finished, Brandon's brow was damp with sweat, and he released a long, weary breath.



He stopped for a moment and realized just how much energy it took to look after an elderly person.



He knew he was stronger than Millie, but even he felt worn out.



How much more exhausting was it for her?


Watching Derek lying there, Brandon found his thoughts wandering to Millie and her tireless routine of daily care.



A beat passed as Brandon looked away, grabbed the basin, and went to empty the water. Then he decided to find the doctor and ask about Derek's condition.



However, before he reached the hallway's corner, he caught the sound of voices.


"My back's killing me. Taking care of a patient every single day is so tiring," remarked the caregiver he had seen earlier.



Next to her stood another caregiver, this one much slimmer.



"You think you're worn out?" the slimmer caregiver replied. "You're looking after Derek Watson, aren't you? Everybody knows he's the easiest to manage and he pays more than anyone else."



Derek's caregiver agreed with a slow nod. "That's right. Everything got harder when his daughter-in-law stopped visiting."



A spark of surprise crossed the slim caregiver's face."Really? Is that so?"


"Absolutely," replied the caregiver as she reached behind to rub her aching back. "She used to come by often and handled a lot of things herself. Honestly,she's more attentive than most of us in this line of work."



The slim caregiver looked unconvinced. "Are you sure?I keep seeing people talk on the Internet about how her reputation's not great. There are rumors she ignores her husband's cheating just for a comfortable life."



A gentle tap from Derek's caregiver made her pause."You actually listen to that online gossip? We caregivers know what it takes to look after someone who's sick. The Watsons have so much money. If she was really that selfish, why would she put herself through all this?"


Still, the slim caregiver seemed doubtful. "But what if she's just putting on an act?"


Derek's caregiver shook her head and kept rubbing her back. "If that were true, she'd only need to pretend for her husband. Nobody would go this far otherwise. Didn't you notice how often Derek's been admitted lately?"


The slim caregiver offered a small nod in response



"It's because the servants at home weren't giving him the best care," said Derek's caregiver with a sigh."They're not careless, of course, but she always paid extra attention, so Derek was better off with her around. And her mother-in-law had nothing to worry.But now? The poor old lady was wearing herself out."



A look of confusion flickered across the slim caregiver's face. "I thought..."



They kept chatting, the conversation drifting further,while Brandon remained just out of sight,listening quietly



His grandfather always meant the world to their family,so only the most trusted caregivers were chosen for him.
There were always enough doctors, nurses,caregivers,and servants at the family's disposal.


Even so, there was a clear gap between professional care and someone who truly paid attention.


Until now, he'd never given that difference much thought.




The memory returned as Millie took his hand gently and said with quiet reassurance, "Brandon, you don't need to worry. I'll make sure your grandpa's looked after."


He recalled seeing those stacks of care books she brought home, the pages covered in her notes.


She really had taken the time to study all those materials.




With a quiet glance downward, Brandon's thoughts grew heavier.


Everything she set out to do, she actually followed through.




Crobert Hospital was located just a short distance from the sanatorium where Derek was.


Brandon found himself wondering if she might still be at the hospital.
The idea crossed his mind-should he pay her a visit?



...


Back at Crobert Hospital, the day had already reached midday.


Alexia explained that her friend still had not responded.so she chose to visit during her own lunch hour.


That meant Alexia's brother, Giffard, ended up with the job of bringing lunch to Millie.


After leaving critical care unit, Millie was placed in a private room.


"Don't stress about your medical records. Reporters and paparazzi can't get your details easily. My dad runs the place, so there's nothing to worry about,"said Alexia, who had been trying to comfort Millie earlier.


The post-production work for Heavenly Melody moved fast, and the episode they shot yesterday had already made it online by today.


As Giffard arrived with the food, Millie was already watching television.


She hoped to catch the edited version of her own performance and see how it turned out.


Sadly, it looked almost the same as the previous live broadcasts-poor sound quality.


It appeared Charles still had not found a way to handle Oakley.



To make matters worse, something downright sickening showed up on screen.



While Millie performed, the program suddenly shifted to Vivian, watching from the judges' backstage lounge.



Vivian, with eyes tinged red, remarked, "Her singing is wonderful.It brings back so many memories."



Even as tears gathered in her eyes, she managed to look strong while she talked about her life before she became famous.



"In those days, Vivian Floral Design was nowhere near as successful as it is now, and I was just another florist hoping to get by," said Vivian. "Then there was this chance and | decided to compete for the Watson Group's floral contracts."



The odds seemed against her, since plenty of people wanted the job. She added, "I honestly didn't think l stood a chance, but the contract ended up being split into several parts, and l managed to win a small section supplying flowers to the CEO's office and the secretary's department."



"That partnership is what gave me the chance to meet Mr. Watson in person for the first time." Vivian gave a light laugh. "He's even more impressive personally than he is on television."



That was how her ties with the Watson Group first began.


Disgust twisted in Millie's stomach.


Now she knew they had a history that went way back.


Vivian kept reminiscing about her experiences with Brandon on TV, but then someone grabbed the remote and switched channels.



When Millie glanced up, she caught Giffard grinning at her,waving the remote playfully.


"Why watch her?" Giffard asked. "You'd have a better time looking at me."


At work, Giffard always got things done, but in moments like this, he was anything but serious.



Millie couldn't help but roll her eyes. "Why would I want to look at you?"



Raising the lunchbox for her to see, Giffard grinned."How about looking at what I brought for you to eat?"



He brought the box closer and took in the scent."It smells so good."
A laugh slipped out of Millie before she could stop herself.





Their conversation carried on, and at that same moment, an Aston Martin rolled into the parking lot of Crobert Hospital.


Brandon climbed out of the car and kept his gaze locked on the doors leading into the inpatient department.
###Chapter 38 Need Help Changing
Somewhere else, Alexia had already reached the building where her friend who streamed the show worked.



After getting no answer on the phone, she decided to head upstairs and look for her in person.


A look of surprise crossed her friend's face when Alexia appeared.



Tia Parry,stepping out of her office, greeted her. "Hey,Alexia,what brings you here?"



"There's something I need to talk to you about,"Alexia replied, casting a glance toward the others in the room before tugging Tia outside.


Tia looked at her curiously. "What's with all the secrecy?"


"I sent you a message last night. Why didn't you respond?" Alexia asked right away.


Tia let out a sigh, shaking her head. "It's actually a little crazy. Everyone who worked the live Heavenly Melody broadcast had to hand over their phones
yesterday."



Alexia's stomach dropped. "Why? What happaned?"



The timing made her uneasy, especially since Millie's performance had been sabotaged right then.



It was even stranger that the crew was now asked to hand over their phones.



Tia shrugged. "Honestly, I'm not sure. They still haven't given ouur phones back. I had to use an outside line just to call my mom and let her know I'm okay."



She continued, "The company said the matter was serious. When I passed by the conference room earlier, I overheard them talking about confidentiality contracts."



Spotting Alexia's concern, Tia squeezed her hand."Are you alright? Tell me what's going on. Maybe I can help."







Back at the hospital, Millie scrunched up her nose. "If it smells that good, why don't you bring it over to my table already?"


While she spoke, Millie moved the small table closer,tapped it with her handd,and glanced at Giffard.


Giffard looked at her with a raised eyebrow, taken aback by her request.


Around Alexia, Millie always put on a sweet and gentle act, but when it was just the two of them, her clever humor showed itself.



Truthfully, that was exactly what Giffard found so appealing about her.



If her feelings for Brandon had not been so obvious,he might have tried his luck with her long ago.



Thinking about this, Giffard pulled up a chair beside her,set the lunchbox down, and neatly arranged her meal on the table.



He flashed a grin. "Everything's ready,Millie. Go ahead and dig in."



Not bothered in the slightest, Millie reached for her fork and took a bite.



Today's meal tasted wonderful-it reminded her of the comforting chicken soup Alexia had brought her recently.



She glanced at Giffard and asked, "Where did you get this from? I want to remember the place."



A knowing smile spread across Giffard's face. "So you like it?" Millie nodded without hesitation."I do."



"If you ever want it again, just say the word and I'll bring it for you," Giffard remarked, still smiling.


The unexpected offer caught Millie off guard, and she started coughing hard. Her elbow knocked into a plate,splashing the sauce onto her clothes.


Quick to react, Giffard handed her a tissue and gently patted her back.


"Are my words really that hard to swallow?”Giffard said,sounding a bit amused and a little frustrated.


Once Millie had calmed down, she wiped at the mess and said, "Let's not do that, Giffard. I only ate your food today because Alexia's unable to bring me my lunch. Normally, I wouldn't dare try anything you bring."


Giffard tapped her lightly on the forehead. "You know,that hurts my feelings."


Millie just gave him a look, unable to come up with a good reply.


When she noticed the spill, she decided it was time to head to the bathroom and change her clothes.


Giffard moved to offer his help as she stood up.


After pushing his hand away a couple of times, Millie realized he would never give up. Since he wouldn't actually come into the bathroom with her, she gave in and let him help her up.



Her hospital room was split in two-a space for her bed, and a small balcony beyond a frosted glass door,providing a bit of sunlight and some privacy



The bathroom was tucked away on that balcony.



Millie slipped inside while Giffard stayed just outside the door.



Standing in front of the mirror, she studied the stain on her clothes,hesitating before speaking up. "Giffard,you know Alexia and I have been friends forever.Since you're her brother, I've always thought of you like family too."


She found the courage to say this only with the bathroom door between them.



"So, about all the things Alexia jokes about us-please don't take any of it to heart," she added.


On the other side of the door, Giffard's grin faded.


The sunlight coming through the window cast long shadows by his feet, and a quiet seriousness settled over him.



After a short pause, he replied with an easy tone, "Yeah, I know. Alexia's always been that way. She never thinks before she acts."



Millie breathed a soft sigh of relief when she heard him sounding just the same as always.



That worry that he might take things the wrong way eased from her mind.



In her heart, Giffard had always been just a friend-nothing else.



Lately, Alexia had gone out of her way to try and pair them up, and no matter how many times Millie refused,Alexia just laughed it off and kept meddling.


Clearing things up today felt right. Maybe now it would save them both from feeling awkward later on.


Thinking that, Millie quickly started to change.


A moment later, Giffard's voice came through the door again. "What's the matter, did Alexia's little match-making game really scare you? Relax! You think you can make it out on your own,or should I call in backup? Need a hand getting dressed?"


His playful joking finally made Millie relax.


With that familiar mischievous tone, she knew everything was back to normal between them. She answered, "I can handle it myself, thanks. You don't need to worry!"



After changing in a hurry, Millie gathered up her soiled clothes and swung open the bathroom door, throwing a pointed look at Giffard, who stood there with an amused grin.



With his signature relaxed manner, he offered his arm and said, "Your Majesty, allow me the honor."



Millie gave him an exaggerated eye roll but rested her hand on his arm, letting him escort her back into the room.



On the other side of the frosted glass, she caught a hazy glimpse of someone lingering by the hospital room entrance. But she couldn't see clearly.



Together, they pushed open the frosted glass door and moved back into the room.



A chilly breeze swept in, causing Millie to shiver for a moment.


Her attention went to the hospital room door, which hung slightly ajar and drifted back and forth, most likely stirred by the wind.



"Was that door open before?" Millie asked. Giffard shrugged, barely interested. "I really don't remember."



He wandered over and pushed the door shut.


Millie just nodded, brushing off her worries. She figured it was probably her imagination or someone just passing through. Hospitals always had people coming and going.



Out in the hallway, Brandon paced to the end of the corridor, his face clouded with anger.



He pressed himself against the wall, lips set in a hard,straight line.



Even from the balcony, he could hear the sound of their playful banter, and the sight of their silhouettes close together through the frosted glass gnawed at him.



He wondered if Millie was up to her old games again.Was she trying to get a rise out of him by letting him see her so close to another man?



Ever since he asked the front desk for Millie's room,things felt off.



The nurse had claimed it would take a while to check her room number. Had the nurse tipped Millie off while he waited downstairs? He wondered if they had timed everything so he would arrive just in time to see this scene.



A deep scowl cut across Brandon's face as he squeezed his fists so tightly that his knuckles paled.
###Chapter 39 The Only One At His Side
A strange feeling settled in Brandon's chest,one he could not push away



Little by little, something important seemed to be slipping out of reach, though he did not yet see it for what it was.



At last, Brandon opened his eyes, and his expression was steady and unruffled.



He knew her tricks inside and out, after all the years they had spent together.



Life without him was something she could never accept.





Turning his focus back to work, Brandon drove to the Watson Group headquarters and threw himself into his usual routine, handling business as if nothing had changed.



Everything on the surface stayed the same, but underneath, things no longer felt quite right.



A chime from his computer broke the quiet. Brandon glanced at his inbox and saw a new email had arrived.



Brandon clicked on the message and saw it was an invitation to a charity gala, set for tomorrow evening at seven.



The invitation mentioned he was expected to show up,preferably with a date.


Almost at the same moment, his phone lit up with a new message from Vivian. "Brandon, I heard the Evans Group is organizing a charity gala. I'd love to help support the patients, but I don't have the right connections. Did you get an invite?Would you bring me along?"



Charity galas were not events Brandon attended often.


In the last seven years, he had only shown up at three.


Usually, people brought an assistant from work,a trusted companion, a girlfriend, a spouse, or a family member to these gatherings.


For Brandon, there had always been just one person who filled that spot-Millie.



No matter the occasion over those years, Millie was the only one at his side at those events.
Now, while their divorce still hung in the air,he meant to turn Vivian down. Still, the memory of Millie and Giffard together back in the hospital, lingered in his mind and made him hesitate.



He pressed his lips together, feeling a wave of unfamiliar emotion rise up inside him.


Without thinking much more, he sent Vivian a reply."Of course."




...



The hours mov/ed by slowly.


At Crobert Hospital, Millie was on a video call with Alex, going over plans for the next round of Heavenly Melody.



Her phone vibrated, announcing a new message.


A glance at the screen revealed it was a charity gala invitation.



At that moment, the hospital room door flew open and Charles rushed in.



Millie turned to him, curiosity in her voice. "What's happening?"



Catching bits of the conversation, Alex took the chance to excuse herself and left Millie to deal wwith
the situation first.


Once the video call ended, Millie focused on Charles.


He dropped into a chair, seeming unsure where to start. "Um,how are you feeling lately? It's just..."


His hesitation was obvious, as if he struggled to get the words out.


Before he could continue, Millie interjected, "I'll go to the charity gala."


Charles blinked in surprise. "You already knew what l was about to say?"



She handed him her phone.



Displayed on the screen was the invitation, addressed to "Serena" for the charity gala.


The event held by the Evans Group was set for seven o'clock the following evening.


Seeing the invitation on Serena's phone meant Charles lost this battle with his family.


Millie was set on staying in the show,and now that the invitation to the charity gala was hers, she knew she could not miss it.


Charles paused, choosing his words carefully."Things
are a little tricky, to be honest."



She gave him a questioning look.


Rubbing the back of his head, Charles said, "My grandfather seems to think I have feelings for you,and he'll be there at the gala, so..."


Millie's lips curved into a smile. "Then you'd better help me pick out a gift for your grandfather-something thoughtful, but not over the top."


"How can you still joke about this?!" Charles stared at her,half exasperated.


Handling his family's complicated dynamics was nothing new for him. His two elder brothers could be a handful, and his father preferred to take life easy.Still, things were manageable.


But when it came to Napier, the family patriarch and founder of Evans Group, everyone treaded more carefully.


Millie knew the dynamics well.


The Evans family stood among the top three most powerful families in Crobert.


Napier had raised two daughters and two sons.Charles ' father was the younger son. His older brother died before having any children, while Charles' father, never too ambitious, spent his time chasing women and expanding the family tree.


Over the years, he had married several times,leaving behind three sons from different mothers.


Charles' mother came into the family late, as the last wife,and had Charles later in life.


Eventually, Napier criticized his son's reckless ways,and he finally stopped bringing new wives home.Otherwise, Charles might have ended up with even more siblings.


The family's female members, including Charles' aunts,were all involved in running Evans Group, but ultimately, Charles and his brothers held the reins and one of them would someday inherit the family business.


Because of Millie's ties to Evans Entertainment,her interests lined up with Charles'; and since he had already done a lot to help her, she felt she owed him her support in return.



It was a matter she needed to take seriously.



Charles read her mind and didn't argue anymore.



"I'll handle the dress and the gift," Charles remarked."I'll be here to pick you up tomorrow."
After thinking for a second, he added with sincerity,"If I can outmaneuver those two brothers of mine and move up in the company, I'll make sure you get a share of the Evans Group."


Millie said nothing, neither agreeing nor refusing, and simply let him take care of the details.


Before leaving, Charles remembered one more thing."By the way, the legal team said the legal notice to Vivian has been delivered." With that, Charles headed out.



Millie gave a quiet nod.


Sending the legal notice was just a way to test the waters. Millie wanted to uncover what V/ivian truly had in mind.



There was always something off about the way Vivian behaved.







As night settled in, Vivian sifted through her wardrobe,trying to decide what to wear for the gala.


Her caregiver from Flaville was at her side, offering quiet company.


"Miss Simpson, I thought the buzz from your last livestream was still ongoing. Why would you want to go to the charity gala too?" The caregiver sounded puzzled. "Your health isn't suited for such exhausting events, at least according to your medical records."


Vivian's eyes moved to the caregiver. "Then figure out how to make my story believable."



The caregiver seemed ready to argue but ended up saying nothing.


With a bitter look in her eyes, Vivian stared at her own reflection. "I'm at the height of my fame and linked to Brandon, but somehow I'm not on the guest list for Crobert's top charity gala. It's absurd! Still,it doesn't matter whether I was invited or not. I'll just go anyway,and I'll go with Brandon."


Her lips curled into a smirk as she rehearsed a perfect,charming smile in the mirror. "This is my moment.I want to make Millie lose her mind. When she sees me standing at Brandon's side, the spot she always filled,maybe she'll finally be crushed and disappear for good.Wouldn't that be something?"


Vivian's eyes gleamed with determination.


A notification from her email cut through her thoughts.


She frowned, walked over to her computer, and clicked to open the message. On the screen was a legal notice concerning the song "Glimmer of Love."



The message spelled out, without any room for confusion, that Vivian had to stop all acts of infringement.


Panic washed over the caregiver as she asked over Vivian's shoulder, "Miss Simpson, what do we do now?"
###Chapter 40 Are You Officially Declaring A...
Vivian's brow knitted as she read through the document; then she checked a few online sites before letting out a light laugh.



"It's nothing to worry about," she said,resuming her search through the rack of dresses. "They're just trying to see how I'll respond."


Her caregiver looked at her, completely lost.


Normally, Vivian kept her thoughts to herself,but this time she explained a bit further. "If they were really serious about suing me, they would have made the legal notice public instead of sending it privately."


"I still don't understand," the caregiver admitted.shaking her head.


Vivian's tone was patient. "They're fishing for my reaction. If I start panicking like you do, they'll pounce and demand a sky-high settlement."



The caregiver's confusion did not fade. "So what are you going to do?"



Vivian just shrugged and pulled a dress from the closet, still smiling. "Nothing. I'm going to ignore them for now."



"Charles won't dare to push me. It's not just because of my connection to Brandon, but also because everyone sees me as a poor, doomed soul." Vivian arranged her face into a sorrowful look.


Vivian tossed the dress toward her caregiver and said,"Iron this before you head to bed." She turned away,her voice calm but firm. "If Charles has any sense,he'll keep his mouth shut. The last thing he needs is to get his brothers riled up and ready to rip him apart."







Time slipped away quickly.



Before anyone knew it, night had returned.


Early that morning, Charles had already arrived to collect Millie.


Alexia frowned, insisting Millie needed more time to recover.


In the end, it was Giffard who talked her into letting Millie go.


Once Millie and Charles had left, Alexia turned to her brother in disbelief. "Giffard, you're really just letting Charles take her?" Giffard nodded without hesitation. "Yes."



"But she..."


"Alexia, let's drop it for now. Pushing too hard could sometimes only make things worse,"he retorted.


Although Alexia still had more on her mind, she just gave a reluctant nod.


She could not deny that, all these years, Millie's heart had always belonged to Brandon, never seeing Giffard as anything more than a friend.



Not wanting to linger on the subject, Giffard quickly changed the topic. "Did you manage to get the video yesterday?"


"Yeah, I did. But there's a bit of a complication," Alexia admitted.



Tia managed to sneak her phone out. She swapped out the phone for a new one she bought and left the original case on before any confidentiality contract could be signed.


That way, even if everyone signed the agreement later, any leak would have technically happened beforehand.


At first, Alexia wondered how Tia had pulled it off, since all the phones had been confiscated. But it turned out those devices were simply stored in a drawer in the office, and people were coming and going all the time.


Later on, she realized no one seemed too worried about theft because the phones had all been wiped clean.



With so many IT experts able to recover data these days, it really came down to how thorough the company was about erasing it-and whether the specialist Alexia would find could restore anything useful.


Alexia went ahead and asked Tia for the device.



Tia handed it over without hesitation, thinking that in a crowd that size during the live show, sneaking out a phone was not exactly impossible.


Besides, nobody had signed any nondisclosure agreements before theswap.



If questioned, Tia could just say she was unaware of any problem.



"Oh, and Giffard, do you happen to know a good IT expert? I could use a recommendation," Alexia asked her brother after explaining everything.



"I actually do. I'll reach out and see who's available," Giffard answered.



Alexia gave a grateful nod.



Lately, a sense of guilt seemed to follow her everywhere.


Though it happened by accident, Millie's miscarriage was the result of her altercation with Vivian.


Never once did Millie hold her responsible. She never expressed a desire to keep the child, and she even went out of her way to reassure Alexia, insisting it was fate and not her doing.


Still, Alexia saw through it, knowing Millie was just trying to ease her burden.


It reminded her of how, years ago, Millie had suggested they get matching tattoos to celebrate their survival after the motorbike accident that left her ugly scars.



···



Night settled across the city.


Outside a grand villa perched on Crobert's hillside,streams of high-end cars glided up the road.


People arrived in waves. Clusters of reporters and photographers staked out positions at the foot of the hill, their cameras ready.


Very few journalists were officially allowed in,but tonight's affair had drawn Crobert's most influential people, turning the event into a prime target for the paparazzi.


Any juicy scoop from the evening could be worth a small fortune.


So, from the winding road up to the sprawling villa parking lot, the area teemed with onlookers and flashing cameras.


Luxury vehicles rolled in one after another, and for a moment, the night sky lit up with the bursts of camera lights.


In one of the Ferraris, Millie and Charles made their way up the hill.


This evening's charity gala, held to raise funds for children in need, called for more understated style.


Millie had chosen a simple yet graceful silver satin dress that hugged her figure with quiet elegance.


A mask still hid her face-not the same as the one she wore during the last live show, but a silver-and-white half-mask that matched her dress and left her lips
 free for tasting wine.


Sitting quietly in the passenger seat, Millie glanced at Charles while the car climbed higher, the moonlight shimmering over her and giving her an almost otherworldly appearance.



Since the Evans Group was hosting the event,when Charles' Ferrari pulled up in front of the villa,all eyes went straight to him and the mysterious, masked woman at his side.



"Serena?"



"Isn't that Serena? The woman behind the mask!"



"Mr. Evans, what's going on between you and Serena?"


"Mr. Evans, are you officially declaring a relationship with Serena tonight?"



Reporters and paparazzi crowded in, microphones pushed as close as possible.



Thankfully, the event's security staff acted quickly,stepping in to bring the situation under control once the crowd grew rowdy.


Charles chose not to answer right away. He stepped out first, and then moved around to open Millie's door and offer his hand, a move that sent camera flashes exploding across the scene.
The questions continued to fly as Charles helped Millie to her feet.


She gave him a small,reassuring nod.


Turning to face the press, Charles remarked, "Yes, this lady with me is Miss Serena Ellsworth, an artist represented by Evans Entertainment. She's simply accompanying me at the charity gala. That's all there is to it. Please avoid reading too much into it."


Given Serena's contract to Evans Entertainment and with the ongoing promotion for Heavenly Melody, it made sense for her to be visible at major events.


With online voting for the show's contestants just around the corner, raising her profile was important.


Still, the reporters were hungry for a headline-something more dramatic, something like an official announcement that Serena was now Charles'girlfriend.



They pushed in even closer.



Charles had just begun to show signs of irritation when someone's voice rang out sharp and loud, cutting through the moment. "Oh my God, is that really happening? Isn't that Brandon's car pulling in? Brandon,the one who has only shown up to three social functions in the last seven years, is actually here tonight?!"
###Chapter 41 Brandon's Jealousy
The crowd's focus shifted at once.



"Is that really him? Gosh, it has to be!" someone whispered. "He's driving the Bugatti Centodieci. Only ten of those existin the whole world."



"He almost never takes it out," another reporter added."They say Brandon's is custom-made worth more than a hundred million."



"In the past seven years, he's only shown up at three social functions. One was two years ago, then four years ago, and the other seven years ago. The rest of the time, he just sent his assistants. He hasn't been to a single event in the last two years."


"Well, considering the Watson Group leads the country in charity work, it's not surprising. He's always been a major donor."


"Still, why did he choose to come tonight?"



"Do you think he came alone?"



"Who would he even bring? Millie?"
"I'm not sure. But there's no way it's Vivian. He and Millie haven't divorced yet. He wouldn't dare show up with Vivian at an event like this."



"You're right."



Curious murmurs rippled through the crowd as Millie and Charles followed the others' gaze, watching the car glide forward with deliberate ease.



Charles clenched his jaw and glanced at his own Ferrari parked nearby. It was a LaFerrari Aperta, but next to Brandon's car, it suddenly didn't feel that special.


Millie's eyes followed the Bugatti as it parked.Within seconds, reporters and paparazzi surged forward,surrounding the car in a chaotic frenzy.


Camera shutters clicked non-stop, the flashing lights so relentless they lit up the area like daylight.


Even the nearby socialites, elegant and poised just moments ago, couldn't help but drift closer, curiosity etched on their faces.


Security quickly stepped forward to manage the crowd as the driver's door opened.


Gasps followed as Brandon stepped out. 
There was no doubt left-it was really him.


Brandon moved with effortless confidence as he circled the car and opened the passenger door himself-a small gesture that only deepened the crowd's curiosity.



Who was inside? Who could possibly make the famously private Brandon appear so publicly, so boldly?


A single foot stepped out, perched in a pair of sparkling Jimmy Choo Averlys, the signature bow catching the light and drawing gasps from the crowd.


Then came Vivian, dressed in a stunning black gown that hugged her figure with elegant precision.


At first glance, the dress looked simple and elegant.But upon closer inspection, there were soft,bridal-like touches that made it stand out.


She stood beside Brandon and gave him a warm smile.Together, they looked perfect, as if they belonged beside each other.


"It's Vivian... it's really her."


"So Brandon came here just to show off Vivian?"



"What about Millie? It really looks like he's leaving her behind."



"Or maybe Millie's stronger than we think. This isn't the first time she's been in a situation like this."



The crowd quietly murmured with judgment and curiosity, their eyes still on Brandon and Vivian.


Charles stood stiffly, his expression tight with anger."HowN could he do this?!" he muttered under his breath.He could not believe Brandon would treat Millie this way in front of everyone. It felt careless and cruel.


Deep down, Charles also blamed himself. After so many years of planning events in the entertainment world, he had assumed this charity gala would be simple. He had arranged for Millie to wear a dress borrowed from one of his brand partners, thinking it would be enough.


He turned to Millie, guilt flickering in his eyes.


But she looked calm. She gave him a small,reassuring smile. Shetruly was not upset.


Millie didn't think she had anything to feel bad about.Lately, she had been trying to save every bit she could to buy back the old properties that once belonged to the Bennett family. If borrowing a gown helped her stay on track with her goals, then it was worth it.


This event wasn't about showing off clothes. It was a
 charity gala. Looking presentable was more than enough.



And as for Brandon's appearance with someone else -that wasn't her concern anymore.



Not far away, Brandon and Vivian were surrounded by reporters asking questions. Flashing cameras and voices echoed around them.



Millie turned away without a second glance. Then she looked at Charles and spoke softly. "Let's go inside."


"Okay," Charles replied gently, and then walked beside Millie as they made their way toward the villa.


At the same moment, Brandon felt an unexpected pull and lifted his eyes. Ahead, Millie and Charles were moving at an unhurried pace toward the entrance.


Charles scarcely registered in his thoughts; all of his attention settled on the woman beside him.



In the silver glow of the moon, she seemed set apart from everyone else, a vision of quiet grace.


Soft curls were gathered at her crown, while most of her hair slipped down her back, framing the gentle line of her neck.



She leaned toward Charles and spoke, the slight curve of her crimson lips turning the simple motion into something striking.



It was Serena.



"Brandon?" Vivian's voice broke through the moment.She had been enjoying the attention from the crowd,but now she noticed he had gone quiet. His eyes were somewhere else.



What had caught his attention?


She followed his gaze but saw nothing unusual.


Brandon looked away and turned back to her. "Let's go inside," he said calmnly.


"Okay," Vivian replied with a gentle smile, slipping her hand into Brandon's as they walked into the villa together.


The paparazzi tried to follow, but the doors closed before they could step inside.


Security held them back.


There was nothing more they could do now except watch helplessly as the couple disappeared into the grand entrance.


Still, having captured clear photos of Brandon and Vivian showing up together was enough to spark headlines across the city. "So that's it for Millie,then?"



"I don't think it's over just yet. Isn't Vivian only expected to live another six months?"



"Yes.These next few months will be difficult. Let's see if Milliecan hold on."


They whispered among themselves, quickly reaching for their phones to send updates to editors and media outlets.



The Evans family's villa stood tall and impressive, its structure spread across three spacious levels. The first floor was set up as the main hall, where the evening's event was being held. The second offered a quieter space with reserved seating for high-profile guests.The third included exclusive lounges and an open-air terrace garden.



Inside, Brandon's arrival stirred a quiet wave of surprise.Conversations paused, and curious glances followed him. It wasn't often that someone like him made a personal appearance.



As the head of the Watson Group-one of Crobert's top three corporations-he held unmatched influence.



He rarely attended events like this himself, which made his presence even more striking.
But Brandon didn't linger in the main hall. After completing the formal sign-in with Vivian by his side,he walked straight to the second floor without stopping.


Only a handful of people had access to that level. The rest could only watch as he disappeared upstairs, their eyes filled with admiration and silent envy.


By then, Millie and Charles had already taken their seats on the second floor.


The moment Brandon walked in, his eyes naturally scanned the room and quickly found them sitting not far away.


Vivian noticed them too. Her attention paused briefly on the woman beside Charles, the one wearing a delicate mask. Her brows drew together slightly.


Serena was here as well.


But after just a second, Vivian relaxed again.


If Serena had come with Charles, she likely wasn't an invited guest but had simply accompanied him.



That thought comforted Vivian. Attending the gala as Brandon's female companion held far more weight than coming along with someone else.
To her, the difference mattered.


A few minutes later, the charity auction officially began. The auctioneer stepped forward, standing beneath the soft lights at the front of the room.



"Let's begin our charity auction for the evening," he announced clearly. "The first item is a valuable antique,generously donated by a private collector. Fifty percent of the final bid will go directly to charity. The starting bid is..."



The atmosphere quickly became lively. Guests raised theirpaddles, one after another, excited by the rare items and eager to show support. The quiet murmur of conversation turned into a gentle buzz of energy as the bidding began.


Brandon sat back in his seat,quietly watching.



Vivian, beside him, leaned forward and scanned the list of upcoming auction items.


"If something catches your eye, feel free to bid,"Brandon said, nodding toward the paddle next to him.His meaning was clear-he would take care of the cost.



Vivian looked up and smiled. "That's kind of you,Brandon, but it's all right. I've saved a little money of my own, and I don't need anything extravagant. I just want to take part in my own way."


Brandon gave a light nod, saying nothing more.


But her words stirred something in him. His thoughts drifted to the day at the courthouse where Millie handed him the property agreement.


The document clearly stated that from the day they filed for the divorce, any new earnings would remain separate.



Now,without meaning to, his mind returned to Millie again.



He remembered the blurred image of her and Giffard behind the frosted glass door.


Had she seen him arrive with Vivian tonight?



Brandon looked down, his expression unreadable. A heaviness settled in his chest, the kind he didn't want to name. His right hand curled slightly, fingers tightening. The jealousy crept in before he even realized it.
###Chapter 42 Why Hasn't She Sent Him A Message Yet
At the same time, photos and clips of Brandon and Vivian arriving at the charity event had already made their way online.


In a matter of minutes, the hashtag #Brandon&Vivian shot straight to the top of the trending topics.


"No way,even Mr. Watson showed up, and he did it in a Bugatti Centodieci!"


"I called it-his date is definitely Vivian!"



"Seriously, the last time he appeared at the Heavenly Melody live show, it was for V/ivian. Now, he's here with her at this charity gala, and he hasn't shown up at any of these events for two years! Everyone knows what's up!"



"There's only one reason-Vivian!"



"He's just trying to get to Millie, isn't he? I'm dying over here!"



"I'm rooting for them! And did you see how amazing Vivian looks tonight?"
It did not take long for another hashtag to rise-#Vivian'sBlackWeddingGown.



"Wait a second, Vivian only hassix months left. That's a wedding dress, but it's black. I can't help but feel emotional."



"She obviously wants to marry Brandon, but this annoying certain someone keeps standing in her way!"



"I wish Millie would just walk away. Didn't you notice?Vivian fainted last night from exhaustion, yet she's still working to help sick children and raise awareness.How can Millie even compete with that?"



Praise for Vivian exploded online, with emotional reactions pouring in from every direction.



···


Inside the charity gala hall, Charles scrolled through the endless stream of comments, his anger barely contained.



"This is disgusting," he remarked,facing Millie. "Evans Group never sent an invitation to Vivian! For a charity gala of this level, why would we include someone with her reputation? Just look at what she's doing-showing up in what's basically a wedding dress? It's infuriating! This was supposed to be about raising funds and helping sick kids, but now all anyone can talk about is her and Brandon!" Charles' frustration
grew with every word.


At gatherings like these, it was normal to see guests showing off their looks or relationships, just as long as they made real donations.


However, Vivian's behavior was almost too much to stomach.



Online, everyone was fixated on her supposed "wedding dress", and there were endless gossips about Brandon going out of his way for her every chance he got.


Vivian was clearly doing all this just to get under Millie's skin!



"I've never seen anyone try to ruin someone else's relationship and be so proud of it!" Charles hissed.


Millie felt grateful for Charles' support. Yet,there was little either of them could do to change anything.



Vivian was protected by her story-that she only had six months left. And people were willing to overlook almost anything because of that.


Elsewhere, Brandon was also on his phone.


Seeing the trending hashtags, he realized the publicity campaign was working at full force.
He switched over to check his messages.


Still nothing from Millie.


Brandon's brow furrowed. Was it just a bad signal?


Ever since the last time he left the Watson Group with Vivian, Millie had started spending more time with Alexia and Giffard, stirring up plenty of drama herself.


Now that he was at the gala with Vivian, he wondered what Millie would do in response.


The screen remained frozen on the final thing he had typed to her, the words still lingering like they were waiting for an answer. "My grandfather's condition has deteriorated significantly. He's requesting to see you."


He scrolled up to see if he missed anything, but there was nothing.



Brandon's fingers hovered for a second before he closed the chat window. No sooner had he done so than the screen blinked and filled with a stream of incoming messages.



The connection had no issues.



There just hadn't been a single word from her.



A faint tension pulled at his mouth. "Brandon?" asked Vivian, watching his expression shift."Did something happen?"


Brandon let his eyes fall shut, slipped his phone into his pocket, and when he looked up again, his expression was composed.


He gave a slight shake of his head. At the same time,his hand tightened into a fist beneath the table where no one could see.




···


Minutes dragged on, with each new auction item brought forward, introduced, and carried off by eager buyers.


Each donor at the event could choose what percentage of their earnings from each item they wished to contribute. At the Evans Group's auctions,items with matching donation percentages were always grouped within the same session. For this reason, unless otherwise indicated, every item on offer during this session carried a 70% donation rate.


Only the very first item, which was an antique meant to get the audience warmed up, featured a lower donation rate of 50%. All others that followed held steady at 70%.



Because this auction was organized by the Evans Group, every item up for bid represented something truly valuable.



Vivian observed as more and more items appeared,yet she kept quiet and refrained from making any bids,knowing how high the prices were.


She felt determined to show Brandon that she could handle things herself and pay with her own money,but she had no interest in making any extravagant purchases.


At last, right before the scheduled break, a new item made its entrance.



"The next piece we have for auction is a tanzanite stone. According to our assessment, the value of this tanzanite is at least one million dollars, its..." The auctioneer continued while the richly colored tanzanite was displayed.



Lighting inside the Evans Group's auction hall was flawless, so when the vivid blue tanzanite went up on the stage, it drew everyone's eyes.



The quality of this tanzanite was outstanding, making it one of the most striking gems in the room.



In one classic film, the female lead wore a necklace described as a blue diamond. However, the gemstone used for the movie's prop was actually tanzanite.
Even theugh this tanzanite was still in its natural state,just leoking at it brought to mind that famous necklace



With the crowd focused on the gemstone, Millie turned her attention to it as well.


This particular gem had come from her collection.


She had originally sold it to Charles, and he made sure to erase any identifying details before sending it to auction.


When she made the decision to attend, Millie realized she needed to contribute something special.


This event, after all, was a charity gala.


Arriving without any kind of donation would have made it impossible to gain Napier's approval.


Her intention tonight was to impress Napier and leave him satisfied with her actions.



While the tanzanite did not reach the staggering prices of other pieces, it still held just enough value to reflect her reputation as an emerging star.


On top of that...


Millie let her gaze drop toward the floor. She had originally picked out this tanzanite as a gift for the child she never got to meet.


When she purchased the gem, her heart was filled with anticipation, and she looked forward to welcoming her baby.


Things had changed since then...



After she found out the donations would benefit children suffering from illness, she felt moved to part with the tanzanite.


Letting this stone go became her personal way of doing something kind in honor of the baby she lost.


A quiet wish formed in her heart,hoping her child was safe and at peace wherever they were.



In the spotlight, the deep blue tanzanite sparkled with an almost magical light.


"The bidding for this tanzanite starts at seven hundred thousand dollars, and the minimum increase..." The auctioneer's announcement trailed off as someone in the audience raised their paddle, prompting the number board to flash a new figure.



"An offer has been made for eight hundred thousand dollars." When the auctioneer repeated the amount,all eyes turned to the bidder.
The entire room realized at once that it was Vivian who now held up her paddle.
###Chapter 43 The Mole On Her Chest
The first bid for the tanzanite came from paddle number 888.


Vivian might've been the one holding it, but that paddle belonged to Brandon.


Millie's attention drifted toward her.


And she wasn't the only one. Nearly every head had turned in Vivian's direction.



Although the second flooroffered privacy for guests that needed privacy, the layout let guests choose whether to be seen or not.


Vivian had opted for the spotlight.


Brandon remained in the dim section behind her.From the first floor, people could barely make out his silhouette,let alone his face.



Charles knew well the tanzanite was donated by Millie since he handled it for her. He also knew exactly why she'd decided to part with it. The moment he spotted Vivian making a bid, rage surged in him. He nearly rose from his seat.
Millie's stare sharpened on Vivian, who still wore that pleasant little smile.


She had every intention of selling the tanzanite and donating to charity tonight, but she would've handed it to a stranger off the street before letting Vivian have it.



At his seat, Brandon watched Vivian lift the paddle again.


"You like it?" he asked quietly, voice steady.


Vivian responded with a small nod, her smile unchanged.



Brandon didn't follow up. His gaze returned to the dazzling tanzanite beneath the gallery lights.


He recognized the tanzanite.



Millie and he had come across it together in early March.



That day, they'd just endured another long lunch with his grandparents, who once again asked when they planned to have children.



While heading back to their mansion, they drove past Crobert's biggest jewelry store in his Aston Martin. The gem had been displayed right there in the front window.


The March evening was cold, but the inside of the car felt comfortable.


He remembered Millie watching the gem a little longer than usual. He'd asked her the same thing he asked Vivian tonight. "You like it?"


She'd smiled faintly and said, "I was just thinking... if we conceive a baby now, the due date would be in Decemnber. And December's birthstones are tanzanite and turquoise."



Then she added, "So it's kind of funny that we saw tanzanite now."



He'd looked at the stone again and asked,"Birthstones? Do they mean anything?"


"Apparently, tanzanite represents love and eternity.Turquoise is supposed to bring victory and success,"Millie had replied. "If I had to choose, I'd go with tanzanite."



She'd turned to him, her smile softer. "Because I'd want to tell our child their parents will always love them."



He had raised an eyebrow and teased. "I'll go with turquoise then. I just want our kid to be successful.Always winning."
She hadn't appreciated that. He had tried to smooth things over. "Either way, our kid deserves the best."


But she hadn't cared about any of that. When he offered to buy the tanzanite, she got annoyed. So he dropped the subject.


They had driven home in silence, but the tension melted away once the car stopped. From the car to the bedroom, they didn't speak much. What followed was breathless and fiery.


He could still see it clearly-the way she moved, the heat of her skin, the scent that lingered on her neck.


And that small mole just above her chest, he'd always been fond of it.


Brandon shut his eyes. His throat tightened. He picked up his glass and drank slowly.


Who had ended up buying that tanzanite? And how had it found its way here,to this charity auction?


Just as the weight in his chest began to settle, a hand reached forward from the seat beside him. Nails painted a shade like pale moonlight curled around a bidding paddle-elegant, deliberate,and quiet.


"Following bidder 888's offer, bidder 823 has entered at nine hundred thousand dollars!"
Both Brandon and Vivian turned their heads.


The seat,the hand holding the paddle-it could only be Serena.


In an instant, the entire room stirred again.Conversations broke out across the villa, the atmosphere thick with curiosity.


"Brandon hasn't attended a charity auction in person in two years, and this is his first bid tonight. For something like that, who'd be foolish enough to go up against him?"



"Exactly. The tanzanite looks good, sure, but it's not some one-of-a-kind treasure. I wouldn't bother."


"Same here. If it were a blue diamond, I might've raised my hand."



"I thought it was Vivian who placed the bid, not Brandon."



"It makes no difference. She used Brandon's paddle,and he let her. That counts just the same."


Heads nodded around the room. That was how things worked in their world.



Unless an item was rare or symbolic, deference was expected.
"I checked. The second one placing the bid is the woman Charles came with-name's Serena."



This new piece of information sent a ripple through the crowd.



"What is this about? Is Charles trying to provoke Brandon?"


"Hard to say. Charles has always been erratic. No telling what he's thinking now."


As the other guests murmured and guessed, Oakley was also on the second floor, laughing so hard he had to brace himself against the table.


"Charles really is an idiot. Grandpa's already furious with him, and now this? He's digging his own grave.I won't even have to lift a hand, he'll take care of himself."



Near the back, another man sat quietly in the shadows.He said nothing, simply swirled the wine in his glass before taking a measured sip.


At the same time, Vivian could hardly believe someone had dared to challenge her bid.


This was all part of her strategy.


She hadn't planned to compete for anything extravagant or meaningless. Just something in between, enough to leave a mark without seeming excessive.



The tanzanite fit that goal perfectly.



She could easily say it was a playful gesture to use Brandon's paddle, but she'd use her own money since she wanted to contribute to charity.


After tonight, this tanzanite would be their symbol,something to mark her connection with Brandon.


Besides, whatever she spent now, he'd make it up to her later. He always did.



Not to mention, the attention online alone would bring her a decent return.


It was their first bid of the night. According to the usual unspoken rules, that should've been enough for others to step back. She'd even bumped the price by an extra hundred thousand, making it eight hundred thousand. She never imagined Serena would respond.



Whose decision was it? Did Serena act on her own?Or was Charles behind it? Were they testing her?Trying to stir trouble? Or were they aiming at Brandon?For what reason though?


She had no answers. And now, she wasn't sure if she should go in again.
The gem's value sat around a million. Her limit was 1.2million. Beyond that, it just wasn't worthit.


As Vivian weighed her options, the auctioneer carried on.


He called out, asking if anyone else wanted to place a bid.



After a second's pause, Vivian lifted the paddle again.


She didn't believe Serena would keep pushing.


"Bidder number 888 has returned with a bid of one million dollars."



A ripple of voices moved through the audience.


"They increased the bid again. They must really want it."



"Will 823 follow?"


All eyes turned toward Millie's section.


Before the auctioneer could say more, Millie lifted her hand.



"Bidder 823 has placed a new bid-one point one million."



Vivian gritted her teeth and scribbled down another bid.She couldn't lose.


"Bidder 888 bids again-1.2 million!"


And right away, Millie raised the bid again.



"Bidder 823 bids again-1.5 million!"
###Chapter 44 It's Millie
The whole room pulsed with restless anticipation.



Millie had already pushed the price higher three separate times,each increase landing with a sense of urgency.



Millie's latest offer shot up from a modest hundred thousand to three hundred thousand, making it painfully clear how badly she wanted to win.


"Is something happening here? Hasn't bidder number 823 realized who she's up against? She's really holding her ground."


"There's no way she's in the dark. Serena arrived tonight with Charles, and the Evans Group is the one running the show. Charles has to be aware of everything that's happening."


"You're right, so what are they trying to pull?"


"Honestly, it's anybody's guess. Brandon might not be bidding himself, but his date is the one raising the paddle. It's almost like number 823 is challenging Brandon head-on."



"The tanzanite itself is only valued at a million. If you ask me, spending anything above 1.2 million just isn't smart. To shoot up to one and a half million, there's got to be a story behind it."


"I couldn't tell you. Are you thinking Brandon will push the price even higher?"


"If Brandon was placing the bids himself, I'd expect him to do it for the sake of his pride. But this time, it's Vivian stepping in, so there's no telling what she'll decide."



"Doesn't Brandon worry about getting embarrassed in front of everyone?"



"You might not realize it, but he wins either way. If he keeps fighting for it, it proves he's determined. If he lets the other bidder take it, he can always say she needed it more, and it makes him look generous in front of everyone."



"Wait,is that really how it works?"



"Why not? Everyone in this room already knows Brandon's wealthy enough to go the distance. If he backs off, nobody's going to doubt that he lacks the money. They'll just figure he's showing some class."


"Still, it feels a little awkward. He can't even manage to win a tanzanite worth a million?"



"Yeah, but if he really wants to, he could always just buy it later and hand it over as a gift. That takes care of everything."


"Now that's clever. I have to say, I'm impressed."



People kept whispering and guessing, their attention fixed on the second floor above them.


Upstairs, every guest sat in their seat without so much as a fidget. Outwardly, everything seemed composed,but underneath it all, the tension was sharp enough to cut the air.



Millie sent Charles a worried look. "Is this going to cause problems for you?"



Charles answered with a smile, "You're the one bidding,using your own paddle. That has nothing to do with me."



A smile returned to Millie's face as she glanced at the table.


On the tabletop sat two paddles, one meant for Serena and the other for Charles.


Each of them had received an invitation, so both had their own bidding number.


Still, going up against Brandon so openly would likely have some consequences. Charles noticed how uneasy she was. "There's nothing to be afraid of," he said as he tried to reassure her."I can handle whatever comes out of this."



He gave her another nudge. "Bid however you feel like bidding. I'll cover anything you need."


MMillie turned to Charles with a quiet gaze and remarked gently, "I appreciate it."


The money didn't worry her at all. What she really wanted to know was if Brandon would get dragged into trouble because of it.


At the moment, Brandon made no move. But would he later? No one knew for sure.



Vivian, on her part, felt trapped by the situation.


Trying to raise the bid higher would be painful, and she couldn't guess whether her rival would push the price up even further.


Refusing to raise the bid might make both her and Brandon look bad.


She wavered for a moment, and Brandon tapped his finger on the table in response.


"Keep going," said Brandon, his tone firm and direct.



Vivian didn't move right away. Instead, she turned toward him with anxious eyes. "Brandon, we don't need to keep going. The bid is already past the real value."



There was another pause as she looked embarrassed."And honestly, I don't even have enough left to cover it."


Brandon's eyes went straight to the tanzanite, his expression calm and collected.


In his mind, he felt like the tanzanite belonged to him.


"Don't you worry about the money," he said.


The message was simple. He intended to pay for everything.


Vivian gave a relieved sigh, though she still insisted,"No, Brandon. We promised I would cover it on my own."


All the while, a few guests kept to the shadows,quietly observing as they waited for the outcome.


At that very moment, the villa's front doors flung wide open, grabbing everyone's attention.


A wheelchair made its way inside, carrying an elderly man who managed to look dignified and strong,even while seated. A warm smile lit up the man's face.


"Apologies for arriving late," he said, smiling. "The energy in here is incredible tonight. I could hear all the excitement before I even came in."


As soon as Charles caught sight of the old man, he quickly got up and hurried down the stairs.


He moved in to help him. "Grandpa, what brought you here yourself?"



Charles had assumed Napier would remain tucked away in a private seat and send for Millie later. Seeing Napier come through the main entrance in his wheelchair had caught him by surprise.


Napier leaned on his cane as he answered, "I simply wanted to see things for myself." At the same moment, two other members of the Evans family arrived and stepped forward to help.


Derek motioned for them to hold back, still smiling as he glanced around at the crowd, pausing when his eyes landed on Brandon, Vivian, and Millie; then he turned his gaze to the item up for auction.


After that, he said something that tended to go over people's heads. "There's something truly special about being young."
Napier's unexpected appearance caused everything in the room to come to a standstill. The auctioneer prepared to continue, but Napier tapped lightly on a plate beside him.


"It's time for a short break now. We'll pick up with the next round in a little while," he announced.



And with that, the auction came to a pause.



People throughout the room grew more and more restless, eager for what would happen next.


Instead of seeing the final moments of the bidding,everyone was asked to wait.


Napier could feel that the crowd was growing impatient, but he stayed silent as his grandsons helped him toward the elevator leading up to the third floor.


Right before the elevator doors slid shut, he spoke to Charles. "Go get her for me. I want to see her."


There was no confusion about whom he meant.



A wave of panic hit Charles. This was definitely the worst time for this.



Everyone present had just witnessed the tense bidding match between bidder 823 and bidder 888. Taking Millie to see his grandfather now would only make things worse.


Had things gone smoothly before, there might have been a chance. Unfortunately, that window had closed.


Charles' oldest brother kept quiet, while his second gave a sly grin. "Go ahead, Charles."


There was nothing Charles could do but obey. He shot Oakley a frustrated look before heading off to find Millie.



Millie already sensed what was about to happen.Before Charles even spoke, she nodded to show she understood.


A heavy sigh escaped Charles. He knew she would have to face this on her own. He helped her to her feet and walked with her toward a private room on the third floor.



"My grandfather is waiting inside," he said quietly."Be on your guard. If you need anything, just call out and I'll be right there."


A gentle smile crossed Millie's lips. "I'm sure it isn't as frightening as you're making it seem."



Charles insisted, his nervousness written all over his face. "But it is! You have no idea how serious this is."



Millie did not push the matter any further. She nodded and said, "Okay, I'm going in now."


Both of Charles' brothers remained close by, keeping an eye on Charles as he paced nervously in front of the door.


Meanwhile, Millie stepped into the room, calmly closing the door behind her before walking toward Napier with measured steps.


She came to a stop and, using her right hand, took off the custom half-mask she had been wearing. She did it with confidence, showing her whole face to Napier without any hesitation.



It became clear in that moment that it wasn't Serena standing before him. It was Millie.
###Chapter 45 Napier's Plans
A gentle smile appeared on Millie's face as she greeted the older gentleman in front of her. "Good evening, Mr. Evans. It's me, Millie."


Napier studied Millie after she pulled down her mask.His face showed only a slight trace of surprise, though he kept his composure.



Understanding settled in Millie as soon as she saw his reaction.


She walked over to where Napier sat, holding the box of premium coffee beans Charles had arranged for her,and began to unwrap it carefully."Charles told me this is Blue Mountain Coffee,your favorite. Would you like me to make a cup for you?" she asked.


A simple nod from Napier gave his answer.


Only the gentle sound of Millie preparing the coffee filled the otherwise quiet room for the next few minutes.



Every movement she made seemed unhurried and practiced.



Soon,the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air.



When the coffee was ready, Millie poured a cup and offered it to Napier, who accepted it and took a thoughtful sip.


"Very few people can make coffee this well. He must have taught you everything he knew," said Napier as he savored the drink.


Lowering her eyes, Millie busied herself with the coffee pot. "There's no one else he could have passed them to but me. I am his daughter, after all."


Both understood that the "he" in their conversation meant her late father.


That man, once so lively and full of pride, was taken from the world forever on a rainy afternoon.



"You almost had me convinced you would never take your mask off," Napier continued.



A quiet laugh escaped Millie as she met his gaze."There's no way a small trick like that could fool you,Mr. Evans. Surely you'd already figured it out," she replied.



She met his eyes without hesitation.



Ever since she received his invitation, Millie knew there was no dodging this meeting. Even though she and Charles had signed confidentiality agreements and usually took extra care,some secrets simply could not stay hidden if Napier decided to look into them.



On top of it all, Millie donated the tanzanite to tonight's charity auction, and Napier would easily figure things out since the event was hosted by the Evans family.



Millie decided not to keep up any sort of disguise the moment she stepped into Napier's lounge.


Napier wasted no time and asked, "What exactly is going on between you and Charles?"


She responded, "Mr. Evans, could you tell me which part you mean?"



"Every part of it," Napier replied, his tone making the air feel heavier.


No hint of anger showed on Millie's face. She offered a gentle smile and explained herself. "First, there's nothing romantic between Charles and me. Our relationship is a straight-up business where both sides benefit. Also, I never asked Charles to get into a bidding war against Brandon, but he was dragged in anyway."



The moment Millie finished, Napier struck the armrest with his palm, frustration flashing across his face.


Remaining calm, Millie met his eyes and said, "You might want to take care of your hand, Mr. Evans."


His anger still burned. "You know very well how powerful the Watson family is here in Crobert,yet you let Charles get tangled up. Are you planning to pull the Evans family down with you?"


She kept her voice steady as she replied, "You've got the wrong idea, Mr. Evans. That was never my goal."


After realizing Millie wasn't shaken by his display,Napier relaxed and let the tough act fall away. "The Evans family doesn't need to meddle in your problems with Brandon. I have no desire to make an enemy of him."



Her smile returned as soon as he finished.


"You always know how to lighten the mood, Mr. Evans,"she said,letting the subject drop there.



His eyes drilled into her, sharp and full of challenge.



Everything Napier built for the Evans Group had not come without a fight. The old hint of a bandit's grit lingered in him from his early years.



It took the tragic loss of his eldest son at sea to bring out a little restraint. Still, the cold, unyielding part of him had never truly faded.



Letting his three grandsons battle among themselves proved just how cutthroat he remained.



Backing down just because Brandon's name was mentioned would never fit his nature.



A short pause hung in the air before Napier finally asked, "What exactly are you getting at?"


Millie spoke gently. "You should actually be pleased,Mr.Evans, that someone finally has the nerve to stand up to the Watson Group."


A bright smile lit up her face. "Mr. Evans, you encourage your grandsons to compete so the family stays strong. If you back down just because Brandon is involved, it's only a matter of time before the Evans family loses its edge. Besides, the Evans Group is not so easily swayed. I'm sure you've already measured the risks and had them under control."



A squint narrowed Napier's gaze as he studied Millie,sizing her up again.



There was something in her that reminded him of his proud eldest son.



Napier indeed had his own plans-plans that ran deeper than she realized,and his strategies were much harsher than she could imagine.


The Watson family might seem unstoppable, but the Evans family wouldn't be toppled so easily. If Brandon decided to press the issue, Napier was fully prepared to sacrifice Charles and offer an apology. He could always say he never knew Serena's true identity was Millie.



If Charles proved himself and took the upper hand,Napier would gladly let him guide the Evans Group to new heights.


Winning this gamble would send the Evans Group even higher.


Losing,however,meant letting Charles take the fall and leaving him to face Brandon alone.



He was ready for that possibility and had already steeled himself to lose a grandson if needed.


Light poured across the room, and the rich scent of coffee gave the space a touch of elegance.


A few moments passed before Millie spoke again. "So,Mr. Evans, does this mean I've passed whatever test you set for me?"



Napier cast a look at Millie, a small chuckle escaping him. "I never really understood why you stayed with
Brandon for as long as you did."


A laugh slipped from Millie. "Well, I've walked away now."



Napier's years of experience meant he had already seen through the nature of Millie's relationship with Brandon.



Millie stood her ground, waiting for what Napier would say next,refusing to be brushed aside.


A quiet standoff hung in the air, neither one willing to show their hand.


It took a while, but Napier finally spoke up. "The only thing I'll promise is not to interfere in the affairs between my three grandsons. The rest will play out as they are. Like you said, I'm letting them battle it out,and we'll see who comes out on top."


A genuine smile touched Millie's lips.


Her visit today had accomplished what she set out to do.



Charles once explained that each of the three Evans brothers managed their own affairs, and that Oakley only managed to stir up trouble this time because he poisoned Napier's mind against Charles.



Napier's opinion shaped the actions of everyone else, so his stance mattered most.


Now that he had promised to stay out of it, Charles finally had a clear path forward.



That assurance was all Millie needed.



She exchanged a few last polite words with Napier and then reached for her mask.



Just as she was about to leave, Napier's voice came from behind her. "It's a shame he left us so soon."



Millie held onto the doorframe, every instinct urging her to turn around and demand answers from Napier about the past.


However,logic and self-control stopped her from acting on impulse.


She had already used up all her strength today,keeping up appearances, pretending confidence, and hiding her true thoughts. Asking questions about her father's death would have to wait for another day.



Letting go of the frame, Millie stepped outside,offered Napier a respectful bow, and gently shut the door before her.


"How did things turn out?" Charles stood waiting,his nerves stretched thin. Soundproof walls made sure not a single word reached him, even with his ear pressed against the door.


With Charles' two brothers looking on, Millie kept her face unreadable and replied, "Let's go back."



She set off down the stairs,leading the way.



At the same time, Charles couldn't keep his frustration in and started to argue with Oakley, who had been provoking him all along.


Choosing not to get involved, Millie made her way quietly down the steps.


Just as she turned into a hallway, someone stepped in front of her.


When she lifted her gaze, Millie saw a familiar face.


A member of the Elliott family stood in her way.


In Crobert, the Watson Group, Evans Group, and Elliott Group each controlled different corners of the city's industries.



The Elliott Group owned the largest share of the jewelry and gemstone trade in town.



Her tanzanite stone had come straight from one of their jewelry boutiques. "Serena?" The person looked her over, an amused spark in their eyes.


Calm as ever, Millie offered a greeting. "Mr. Jayceon Elliott."



A look of surprise flickered across Jayceon's face."You know who I am?"



Millie met his eyes and answered, "Your reputation precedes you. It would be impossible not to recognize you."


Jayceon paused for a moment, considered her words,and quickly brushed it aside as nothing remarkable.


"Tell me, why were you and Vivian both after that tanzanite stone?" Jayceon leaned closer, searching her face. "Are you willing to share the real reason?"


Millie answered him with a quiet smile, choosing to remain silent.



"I did some digging to find out why that stone caused so much buzz, and had my people check into it. Do you want to hear what they discovered?"


Her gaze stayed forward, her expression unreadable as she kept her silence.

 
Jayceon only grinned. "Maybe you're not curious, but I'll say it anyway. The last owner of that stone was Millie, Brandon's wife."
###Chapter 46 Are You Actually Worried About Me
Millie kept her face composed and untroubled.


Anyone in the Elliott Group could dig up that much information, so it carried little weight in the grand scheme of things.


"Have you met Millie before?" Jayceon asked out of the blue.



"I haven't," Millie answered in a steady tone.


Jayceon looked puzzled and scratched his head."That's odd."



With a small smile, Millie turned to him and said,"There's nothing strange about it. Maybe she once fancied that tanzanite but then changed her mind about it and later gave it to someone else. After changing owners a few times, it finally ended up at this auction."



Jayceon shook his head and replied, "I don't think so.From what I heard, Millie was attached to that tanzanite. Apparently, someone else wanted it too back then, and she fought hard to get it. It just doesn't add up that she'd let it go so easily."
For a moment, Millie fixed Jayceon with a quiet stare,making him shift uncomfortably.


She eventually broke the silence with a gentle smile."But in the end, she still let it slip away, didn't she?"


Since the tanzanite was now up for charity auction,that meant Millie, along with whoever had owned it after her, had all chosen to let it go.


Jayceon fell silent, realizing she had a point that was hard to dispute.



Nothing came to mind that he could argue.


"Excuse me," Millie said politely, offering a slight nod before continuing down the hall.


She had barely taken more than a few steps when Vivian appeared in her path.


A wave of annoyance passed over Millie, and she tried to move past, but Vivian stepped right in front of her on purpose.


"Serena!" Vivian called out, refusing to let her leave.



Stopping in place, Millie regarded Vivian with calm patience,unsure what she wanted now.



A cold warning filled Vivian's eyes. "You'd be smart to step away now. You're nothing more than Charles
companion. You ought to show Brandon some respect. If you keep this up, you'll only end up hurting both yourself and Charles!"


Millie paid no attention to Vivian's threats and let her gaze drift over the black dress Vivian wore.


There was no denying the dress had all the makings of a bridal gown, with layers of fine lace that only highlighted Vivian's beauty.


Clearly, the gossip making rounds online had been accurate.


Brandon,who typically stayed out of the spotlight,chose this moment to show up in a big way, arriving with Vivian dressed like this.


The thought crossed Millie's mind-what was Brandon trying to prove?


Was he just unaware, or was he giving Vivian free rein on purpose?


Maybe he was in a rush to make his relationship with Vivian official.


Perhaps it didn't bother him at all that he and Millie were still technically married and going through a divorce.



A slight dip of her eyes betrayed Millie's
disappointment before she turned her back on Vivian.



"Vivian, there's no reason for you to say any of this to me. If you want the tanzanite, then bid for it. If I want it, I'll do the same. Let's just see who comes out on top," she answered in a quiet, steady voice.


A cold laugh escaped Vivian. "Come out on top?Serena, that's justwishful thinking. The only reason either of us is here is because of the men backing us.Brandon holds more power than Charles, so I already have the advantage."



Vivian's smugness was grating, and Millie saw no point in dragging things out. She turned and walked away.


A warning rang out from behind. "Serena, you're running out of chances! When you lose, it's going to be humiliating! I'll be waiting for you to crawl back and beg for mercy!"



Only the briefest pause gave away Millie's irritation before she moved on.



Looking to avoid anyone else in the hallway, Millie made her way up to the third-floor terrace garden.


A lively scene awaited her-business tycoons, art collectors, and celebrities all gathered together.


Champagne glasses filled their hands, and each clink seemed to seal another silent agreement between them.



Soft lighting gave the space a gentle glow, while piano music floated on the evening air.


Glasses continued to clink in the midst of so much glitz and sophistication.



Millie slipped into a quiet corner, lifting her champagne glass and letting the breeze brush past her.



Fragments of conversation drifted on the wind from all sides.



"The third auction item caught my eye-a diary written by a courageous young girl battling illness. It deserves a place in someone's collection."


"I feel the same way. Some of these children's drawings show real promise, but their tough situations hold them back from getting any closer to the world of art."



"My hope is that this charity event will raise enough funds and bring some comfort into their lives."



"Whenever the Evans Group hosts a charity gala, I trust them. They always set aside generous funds, so I never worry that the donations won't get to those in need."
"That's a relief. So, what are you hoping to bid on during the second half of the night?"



"Honestly, I'm more interested in the competition.I want to see whether the bidders holding badges 888and 823 go head-to-head!"


"Same here! The suspense is killing me!"


"Maybe we should all place bets on who takes the prize."



Excitement buzzed through the crowd as more people jumped in, their early whispers replaced by animated voices.



Every guest wanted to join in the fun.


While the crowd speculated, Millie stayed quiet,soaking in the lively energy around her.


Suddenly, someone stepped in front of her, casting a shadow over the light.


Turning, Millie saw Brandon standing there, a frown creasing his brow.



Behind him, the shouts and laughter of the betting pool carried on, while his gaze remained dark and searching.

 
He broke the silence with a single question. "Why did you do it?"


They both knew he meant her bid on the tanzanite.


Meeting his eyes, Millie offered no answer and instead threw the question back. "What about you? Did you do all this for Vivian?"


Brandon said nothing, his mouth drawn in a firm line.


Until that moment, he hadn't really thought about his reasons.


Just like always, he acted on instinct and rarely stopped to wonder why.



For him,that was enough.


However, when the masked woman questioned whether he was doing this for Vivian, he couldn't honestly agree with her in his heart.


Deep down, he simply couldn't stand the thought of the tanzanite ending up in anyone else's hands.


That was the only thing he truly understood.


As for the reason behind that feeling, he had no explanation.



Standing in front of him, the woman seemed delicate and frail, the wind making her appear even more fragile, almost like she could be swept away. Almost without thinking, he asked, "Has it always been like this?"



When her eyes showed confusion, he added, "I mean,has he always pushed you too far and forced you to keep working, even when you're unwell?"



A slight lift of her eyebrows showed that Millie didn't follow what Brandon was getting at.


After a few moments, she replied, "Mr. Watson, are you actually...worried about me?"


She chose the word "worried," not just "cared."



His mouth pressed into a thin line, and he offered no reply.



Dropping her head, Millie smiled to herself, but there was a prickling sensation in her nose.



She had stood by him through endless days and sleepless nights, only to hear him say, "Vivian's dying,you should show some sympathy." But now, with her standing in front of him as nothing more than Charles 'companion, Brandon chose that moment to act like he cared.



The irony was impossible to ignore.


"If you really believe I belong to Charles, Mr. Watson, what are you doing right now?" Millie's voice was quiet as she spoke with her head bowed. "Why say these things to me at all?"



From behind the mask, Brandon could see nothing of her feelings.


Nothing made sense to him-not his own thoughts,and certainly not her heart.



He had nothing to say in return.


Swallowed by a wave of emotion, Millie finally looked up at him, seeing onlyhis silence and furrowed brow.



"Mr. Watson, you shouldn't let your concern reach past your partner, or else you'll only end up betraying her." Millie paused for a second, her lips curling up softly."That kind of thing would only break her heart."



A picture suddenly filled Brandon's mind.


He saw a pairof sorrowful eyes. They were Millie's eyes,filled with tears.


"Some people hardly matter, Mr. Watson, but some really do. And if someone important chooses to walk away, you might never get a second chance." Her voice was gentle, her red lips moving gracefully as she spoke,looking both beautiful and distant.


She wore a smile,but somehow he could feel that she was crying inside.
###Chapter 47 He Had Every Intention Of Winning
A deep breath steadied Millie as she lifted her eyes to the stars above.



This time, she truly felt herself letting go. When she lowered her gaze again, she took a moment to regain her calm.



Her attention shifted and she managed a gentle smile."Forgive me, Mr. Watson. I may have spoken out of turn since we barely know each other."



Her glass was empty by the time she set it down."The break is ending soon, so I'll head down now."



Without another word, Millie walked right past Brandon.



His voice followed her just as she neared the stairs."You should stop bidding."



How many times had Brandon pleaded on VVivian's behalf, openly fighting for her in front of Millie?


Anything for Vivian-there were no limits for him.



Not once did Millie hesitate or glance back;her steps carried her straight down the corridor, while Brandon stood watching as she disappeared from view.


A cool breeze slipped through, and a heartbeat later,Brandon's own figure vanished at the corridor's end as well.



From the garden, bits of lively conversation floated on the air.


"I'm putting five million on 888 coming out on top!"


"That's a bold move."



"Keep in mind who's holding badge 888-Brandon never loses when he sets his sights on something!"


"You're not wrong, but that kind of certainty takes the thrill away."


"There's still plenty of fun. What if we bet on how many times 823 will even dare to raise her paddle and challenge Brandon?"


"That's actually a good bet! I say zero times!"



"I'll say once!"



"Anyone else think she'll go for more?"


"You're hilarious. That woman might find the nerve to bid once, but more than that is hard to believe!"
 Their laughter rose together, everyone just enjoying the moment without a care.



At that moment, Vivian was using a secondary account called "V" to chat with someone online.



V typed out a question. "What's Napier's stance on Serena now? I heard she walked out looking totally composed after their talk. Or are you just too useless to keep her in check?"



The man using the screen name "Blade Joker"retorted, "What a load of nonsense! Don't ever call a man 'useless'! Relax. Charles even got riled up and started a fight after Serena stepped out, which means he's rattled. I know Napier well; he doesn't get swayed easily. Serena taking on Brandon is going to end badly for her. Just sit back and watch Charles trip up, and after that,you can go after anyone you like."



Vivian's lips curled into a faint smile as she responded,"Hearing you say that puts me at ease. I got nervous when Napier wanted to meet her."



Blade Joker answered, "You worry too much."



Their messages kept flying back and forth, the tone growing sharper, while elsewhere Brandon returned and happened to glance over.


Sensing his arrival, Vivian hurried to lock her screen. A sweet smile crossed her face. "You're back,Brandon."


A simple nod was all Brandon offered.


His habit was never to pry into anyone else's business,so he let his gaze wander and thought nothing of it.


Still, something about Vivian's avatar on that account stuck in his mind.


That wasn't the profile she used for their chats; it had to be a backup account. Yet, there was something oddly familiar about that image, as if he'd come across it before.



On the second floor, tucked away in the shadows,Jayceon watched the party below, a grin on his lips.He kept whispering things to himself, when suddenly the gorgeous woman beside him lost her patience and gave him a sharp kick.


"Hey! That hurt! Adriana, what was that for?" shouted Jayceon as he grabbed his face in pain.


His sister-Adriana Elliott-only responded with another swift kick.



That was enough to send Jayceon scrambling away,muttering complaints as he made for the corner.


Once he was out of the way, Adriana rolled her eyes and went back to sipping her wine.


A sense of injustice lingered with Jayceon. The Elliott family, counted among Crobert's three major powerhouses,always prided themselves on unity.


Things were different for the Watsons, where Brandon carried the weight of the entire Watson Group alone,or the Evans family, where cutthroat sibling rivalry was the norm and every move was calculated. In contrast,the Elliott siblings managed to keep their relationships peaceful.


Within the Elliott family, everyone had a clear role.The eldest son, gifted with strong leadership, ran the company, but both Jayceon Adriana were also given meaningful responsibilities and regularly took part in major decisions thanks to their brother's trust.


Teamwork was at the heart of the Elliott family's rise as one of Crobert's elite families.


Being the youngest however, Jayceon sometimes truly feared a well-placed kick from his sister.


Adriana took a slow sip of her wine and said, "If you don't understand the importance of customer privacy,Jayceon,you'd be better off quitting the Elliott Group than putting our reputation at risk."



Her words landed, and Jayceon quickly nodded in agreement. 
He had just gotten swept up in the moment-interesting things like this didn't happen often.



"I promise I won't do it again, Adriana," Jayceon murmured.



A tiny nod from Adriana showed she'd let him off the hook this time.



In the darkness nearby, someone watched the entire scene unfold, their expression hidden.


Time slipped by, and soon enough, the breakcame to an end with everyone's eyes fixed on the stage.


Guests moved back to their seats as the auction resumed.



Stepping onto the stage, the auctioneer greeted the crowd and introduced the tanzanite. "Welcome back,distinguished guests. Our intermission has ended.It's time to resume the exciting bidding!" The auctioneer motioned to the display. "Earlier, the highest bid for the tanzanite reached 1.5 million from bidder 823.Now,the competition continues!"



Vivian sat quietly on the second floor, listening to every word, her eyes shining with anticipation.


With quick movements, she recorded the new bid and raised her badge 888 to enter the fray.
"The bid from 823 has been topped-bidder 888steps in with an offer of 1.8 million!" announced the auctioneer at once, declaring Vivian's newest move without delay.



A rush of excitement swept through the room.


"Just as I thought, Brandon jumped into the bidding war.At this point, it's not about the tanzanite-it's all about his pride!"


"Right, what's 823 going to do now? Surely she knows how much money Brandon has. Is she really planning to raise the bid again?"


"I have no idea. I don't even understand why she kept bidding in the earlier rounds."


Vivian gave Brandon a sheepish smile and said,"Brandon, I didn't bring enough money with me tonight. I'll cover the rest later, so you can still count this as my purchase."


Not once did Brandon glance in her direction. His response was short. "That won't be necessary."

All his attention was on the seats where Serena and Charles were sitting.


He searched the crowd but couldn't make out their faces in the dim light.
Vivian's eyes followed his, and she quickly realized he was waiting to see if Serena and Charles would place another bid. A smug look spread across her face as she stared in their direction.


Just then, the familiar hand rose again, lifting the 823paddle.


"Bidder 823 has now upped the bid to 2 millionl"


A look of disbelief froze Vivian's smile in place.


The room instantly filled with the sound of excited whispers and frantic conversations.


"Unbelievable-she actually dared to raise it!"


"I'm shocked too. There was plenty of time during the break for them to settle things quietly. What's giving her the nerve to keep challenging Brandon like this?"


"Could there be more going on behind the scenes?"


"I want to know the truth! Someone, spill it already!"


While everyone argued and speculated, Vivian kept glancing at Brandon to see his reaction. Out of nowhere, he stood and strode over to the railing above the auction floor.


"Look, Brandon's getting up-he's making a move!"
Everyone turned as Brandon stopped at the railing,lifting his right hand to get a staff member's attention.After taking the microphone, he spoke into it clearly."No matter what bids come in, I will continue to bid."


There was no mistaking it-he had every intention of winning.
###Chapter 48 His Feelings For Her Ran Far Deeper
Excitement burst through the entire room.



A surge of energy carried the auctioneer's voice as he called out, "Bidder number 888 just made a bold move!Let's give him a big hand!"



Applause thundered fromn every corner.



Every eye in the room could feel the tension rising-this was the climax of the auction!



Before,people had whispered among themselves, but now voices rang out as everyone started talking and shouting without restraint.


"Wow! It's been forever since a charity auction was this dramatic!"



"You're right! The last time we saw anything like this was a year ago, all for that antique cup. The bids just kept climbing until some mystery bidder swept in with a twelve-billion-dollar offer and ended it!"



"Don't forget the one three years back. A single painting set off a bidding war, and another mysterious bidder snatched it for seven billion!"
"And there was also that modern art sculpture in Flaville-another seven-billion-dollar finish, all thanks to an anonymous buyer!"


Loud chatter filled the space, with one person turning to his friends in confusion. "You keep talking about these record bids, but what's actually happening right now? I still don't get it."


A quick answer came back. "It's all about Brandon's signal. He's letting everyone know he's not backing down-he's going to keep bidding for that tanzanite,no matter how high it goes."


The puzzled guest tried again. "But can anyone just do that? What if they can't pay up?"



Someone else leaned in and explained, "The auction house has rules for this. The Evans family runs a tight ship. I heard of one person who tried and couldn't cover the bid, and the fallout? Wasn't pretty. We're all guests of the Evans Group, so they're definitely in control. Even at smaller auctions, they check that bidders have the money first."



A thoughtful nod followed."That makes sense."



Another voice chimed in, "But there's nothing to worry about this time-this is Brandon Watson we're talking about!"
Everyone agreed, because Brandon was the face of the Watson family-the most powerful name out of Crobert's three leading families!


Lighting in the venue first faded, but then flared back to life,filling the room with bursts of color that swept across the entire space.


Outside, the quiet streets around the mansion transformed as clusters of drones filled the sky.


Every drone glowed brightly, hovering in formation and painting intricate patterns high above the estate.


"What's all this? Did something happen?"


"No clue. What's going on inside?"



"Somebody go check! Whatever it is, it must be big!"



Back in the mansion, screens projected a live feed of the scene outside. Inside and out, everything was a whirlwind of activity.



A question suddenly rose above the noise. "Has Brandon ever gone this far at an auction before?"



Someone answered, "He actually did, once."


"Really? How come I never heard about it? What was he bidding for?"
A thoughtful look crossed the person's face before they replied, "It happened seven years ago, if l remember right."


"Seven years ago?" the listener asked, surprised. "He would have been so young."


A quick nod confirmed it. "That's right. He was just a teenager, and the thing he wanted was pretty unusual."



Interest only deepened. "What was it?"


A moment's hesitation, and then the answer came. "It was a document."


"People auction off documents?"


"Yeah, apparently. The details are fuzzy, since the auction was private. Only a few people even know it happened. I stumbled on the story by chance, but l never heard the full tale."



...


Not far away on the second floor, Vivian stared at Brandon,her heart racing.



Once she realized what Brandon was doing, Vivian found it almost impossible to stay seated.



The rush of excitement faded into a deep satisfaction,giving her the feeling that everything was falling into place as she wanted.



Among all the men in Crobert, Brandon held power and status above anyone else-he was the type women would do anything to win over. Yet here he was,making such a bold move just for her.


Victory felt close enough for Vivian to taste.


With barely any effort, she managed to get Brandon to prove his love for her in front of everyone.


All at once, it became clear-his feelings for her ran far deeper than anything he had ever felt for Millie.


Watching Brandon, Vivian noticed his calm face as he stared straight at Serena, waiting to see her reaction.



A sly smile tugged at Vivian's lips, eager for the moment Serena would have no choice but to accept defeat.


Meanwhile, Charles sat beside Millie, his anger simmering to the point of eruption.


"Just what is Brandon thinking?" Charles blurted out,leaping to his feet. If Millie hadn't grabbed his arm,he might have stormed over to confront Brandon.


"Allowing Vivian to use his paddle was already bad enough. Even if he let her bid against you for the tanzanite, I could try to excuse it by saying he didn't know what the stone realy meant. But this?" Charles's frustration left him breathless. "Right here, going this far for his lover at a public auction packed with reporters, where the whole world will hear about it-what kind of position does this leave you, who is still legally married to him?"


Glancing at Millie, Charles saw nothing but calm, and his anger grew heavy with worry.


Everyone was aware that while the auction might be private within these walls, the moment it ended,everything would become public knowledge.


No reporter, and certainly not Vivian, would ever let such a story slip away.


As Brandon's wife, Millie would be the talk of the town by then,ridiculed by all.


Besides, people had no clue that Serena and Millie were the same person.


If the truth ever came out... it'd only be more humiliating for Millie.


Charles didn't even want to imagine the fallout.


Millie simply stared at Brandon, her expression hidden behind the white mask, her feelings impossible to guess.


Seven years was all it took to turn Brandon into someone she barely recognized, able to shift all his former tenderness toward someone new.



A memory flitted by-Brandon at thatprivate auction seven years ago, his right hand held high as he placed a bid.


At last, Millie's lips formed a faint, ironic smile,her eyes remaining cold and distant.


"Serena, do you want to keep bidding?" Charles asked,his voice tight with worry.


Only a calm smile answered him. Millie looked unbothered by the show of money and influence-her smile never faltered.



Colorful lights swirled as the auctioneer called out with energy, "The auction isn't over yet! Please continue placing your bids."



But his attention never left the seat marked 823.



Everyone's eyes followed, each person eager to see what choice the woman holding that number would make.



In the next moment, a hand reached out from the darkness, raising the paddle marked 823.


A new bid followed immediately after.


The screen above the stage changed,displaying a new offer-five million dollars.


Stunned, the auctioneer stared at the number, and  then glanced up at the bidder on the second floor,double-checking just to be sure.


Finally, his voice rang out for all to hear. "Bidder number 823 is still in the game with a new bid of five million!"
###Chapter 49 Ten Million
The entire crowd erupted into chaos.


"She's still bidding? What is she trying to prove?"


"Brandon has already said he'll keep bidding no matter what, and yet she's not backing down?"


"Does she honestly believe she can outbid Brandon?"


"The price has already soared to five million, but the Tanzanite itself is only worth one million. If someone buys it now, they're paying five times what it's worth!"



"What's really going on here?"



"Is this fight really about the gemstone, or is it about the people locked in this contest?"



Curious looks bounced around the room, until finally someone asked,"If two people both make the kind of declaration Brandon did, how do they resolve it?"


A hush settled for a few seconds before a reply came."It all comes down to who has the stronger will to keep going-also the deeper pocket to pay for this."



"Think back to that case in Proidan four years ago-a bidding war just like this one. Two bidders went head -to-head, and no one was backing down. The final price turned out astronomical."
"That single auction almost destroyed the Todd family,one of the top names in Proidan. Their fortune took a massive hit, and the aftermath dragged on for years.Everyone in Proidan knows the story."


"It's almost scary to think about!"


"You're right-once you're in, and it becomes impossible to back down gracefully. No one can predict who will give up first or whether the winner can even afford the final bid."



"So that's what could happen."



"But 823 hasn't made any big declarations like Brandon, she's simply matching the bids. What is she really up to?"



"Beats me."



"Oh, and wasn't there a bet going on? Weren't we guessing how many times she would keep bidding after Brandon jumped in? She's already gone after him once-anyone who said zero better pay up!"



"The game isn't over yet. Let's see how it ends!"


The downstairs crowd kept the chatter going, while upstairs, Vivian, who thought she had everything under control, sprang to her feet the instant she saw Serena push the bid higher.


A sharp edge crept into Vivian's voice. "What is she trying to pull?"
With Brandon's influence and standing in Crobert,everyone knew his earlier statement meant he would end up winning the auction, so why was Serena still bidding at all?


Was it possible Serena honestly believed she could outbid Brandon?


If not, then what was her real intention?



Was she provoking them?



And was that challenge meant for Brandon, or was it aimed right at Vivian?


While Vivian was left confused, other reactions rippled across the second floor.


Charles sat there, completely unable to guess Millie's true plan.


Despite his fiery temper, he was careful about most things, and never pushed when something was out of reach.



Even though Millie had first chosen the tanzanite as a present for her own child and-for that exact reason -didn't want Vivian to have it,there was no way they could match Brandon's resources now that he set his eyes on it, so why keep bidding?


From what Charles knew, Millie didn't act on a whim,so maybe she was simply pushed too far by the way Vivian and Brandon behaved tonight.
With that thought in mind, Charles leaned in slightly and said quietly, "Serena, you okay?"


Millie glanced at him, her eyes lifting just enough to meet his gaze.


Her reply was simple. "Do you trust me?"


That one look from her,hidden behind the mask,sent his heart pounding.


Those eyes had a kind of power-enough to make anyone follow her lead.


Charles balled his right hand into a tight fist. But a second later, he gave her a small,steady nod.


Things had gone this far already; he was ready to go all in with her, no matter the outcome.


A few seats away, Oakley leaned in, his face lit with glee.


He waved at Charles and called out quietly,"Can't even handle your own woman, and now she's up against Brandon. Grandpa's still here at the villa-you'd better be ready for a lecture later!"


The words sent Charles' anger boiling.


Brandon might be out of reach, but Oakley was a different story-Charles wasn't afraid of him at all.


Without another thought, Charles marched straight st over to Oakley.


Oakley sneered, "What are you planning, Charles?You've been hanging around Serena for ages-aren't you tired of it yet? I don't need a brother who just sucks up to a woman."



That was all it took for Charles to snap. "You'd better watch what you say!" He clenched his fists, ready for a fight. "If you don't shut your mouth, don't blame me for shutting it for you!"


Oakley refused to back down. "Go ahead, see if that helps. You should just wait-Grandpa's going to have plenty to say to you later!"


The argument quickly spiraled, drawing attention from all around.



Interest sparked on the second floor as more people watched the brothers' bickering.


Jayceon even tried to get involved, but Adriana quickly yanked him back by the ear and forced him into his seat.


A sigh slipped from Adriana. "Will you ever learn to act like an adult?"


Jayceon murmured, sounding as miserable as a scolded puppy, "As long as Myron acts the part, I'll just do whatever..."



If Jayceon had been more driven or capable, the Elliott brothers would likely fight each other for power just like the Evans brothers.


That fact had always been obvious to him,


"That's enough." The words came from a man hidden in the dimness between the rows, and it was only then that the two finally brought their antics to a halt.


Meanwhile, the auction rolled on.


Over at seat 888, Vivian hesitated, and then leaned toward Brandon as if trying to calm things down."Brandon, what are we supposed to do now?"


She added, voice dripping with feigned concern but carrying an edge, "Does she really need that tanzanite?"


Brandon still refused to acknowledge her. His cold,focused stare remained locked on seat 823.


Though Serena lingered in the shadows, the silver-white satin of her gown caught the faintest light,making her presence impossible to ignore, even without the glow of moonlight.


Echoes of their earlier conversation still circled in Brandon's mind.



Her soft words seemed to carry a power that unsettled the heart-dangerous, yet impossible to resist.


No matter how hard he tried, Brandon couldn't see her face, but he sensed her eyes lingering on him. Over in seat 823, Millie watched Brandon with perfect composure.


"Bidder 888 is raising the bid to six million!" The auctioneer's voice rang out, barely able to contain his excitement. "Anyone want to go higher? Please, feel free to keep bidding!"


A round of eye rolls swept through the audience below.



Who would even dare continue at this point?


This tanzanite was only worth a million at best. Even 1.2 million would have been steep.


Now, the bidding had soared far beyond its value-and angering Brandon wasn't worth the risk.


That left just one person in the running, the woman sitting in seat 823.


Every eye in the room snapped back to the same spot on the second floor.


Everyone saw it-her hand appeared once again.


With silvery nails and smooth skin, the hand lifted the paddle with calm assurance.


A ripple of shock ran through the crowd.


The auctioneer paused for a moment but then finally announced with excitement, "Bidder 823 continues.offering ten million!"
###Chapter 50 Her Intent
Ten million dollars!


That was unbelievable! The price had increased tenfold!



Shock rippled through the crowd, and for a couple of seconds,nobody said a word. Then the silence broke.and the place exploded with frantic voices.


"She's still biddingl"


"Whoever's at Seat 823 realy wants to go head-to-head with Brandon!"



"That takes some nerve!"



"Are we about to witness something historic here?"


"I bet Brandon's never had anyone push him like this!"


Voices echoed all over, nearly drowning out every other sound.



Vivian shot a glare toward Seat 823,her jaw tight with frustration.


She was struggling to figure out Serena's endgame.



An idea flashed in her eyes.


After a moment, she turned her back to Brandon,
careful not to draw attention, and quietly typed out a message to someone



On the other side, Brandon lifted his hand again.


"Bidder number 888 is still in the running. The new offer is twelve million dollars!" the auctioneer called out.



"Twelve million-now it's twelve times the original!"


"Gosh, this is crazy! How far will this go? Will she keep pushing?"


A single piece of tanzanite was now worth twelve million dollars!


Excitement swept across the entire hall, and the l spotlights focused on the two second-floor seats.


Everyone was whispering to one another.


"She's doing this on purpose-she's just driving up the price! There's no way this is fair!" someone screamed from somewhere in the crowd.



For a split second, the entire room went quiet before bursting into noise once more.



People glanced around, searching for the speaker,but the person was already long gone.



A few people chimed in, supporting that thought,"Honestly, Brandon has already promised to outbid anyone for the tanzanite, but she keeps pushing the price higher. Maybe she's just trying to make Brandon pay an extra fortune for that gem."


The majority, however, seemed to treat it all like a show and didn't care what her reasons might be.


"Brandon isn't clueless. Since he made that promise about the tanzanite, you'd think he saw this coming."


Another person added, "Yeah, Brandon chose to go down this road. He's not the type to be scared off by someone else trying to outbid him. On top of that.this sum barely means anything to him."


With the noise rising, the auctioneer stepped in,hoping to keep things under control. "Distinguished guests, please keep your composure. At Evans Group Auction House, we do not permit any form of malicious bidding."


People simply ignored him, since everyone at this charity auction belonged to a world where normal rules did not always apply.


As the conversation heated up and some guests began pulling out their phones, clearly aiming to share what was happening, a sudden flurry of sharp, quick knocks captured the entire room's attention.


Immediately, every light focused on the high platform above the second floor.


A wheelchair slowly came into view. There sat Napier Evans, unmistakably present in his wheelchair.
He picked up the microphone.


"Good evening, everyone." Napier's words, though carried by an aged voice, rang out with steady authority.



For a moment, all conversation came to a halt.



"Bidder number 888," Napier announced.



Brandon lifted his gaze to the platform, giving Napier a respectful nod.



"Bidder number 823," Napier called out again.



In response, Millie rose slowly from her seat, drawing every eye in the room.


Under the curious eyes of everyone present, she moved out from the shadows and took her place by the second-floor railing, just as Brandon had done.


With the spotlight shining directly on her, the silver satin gown she wore seemed to make her even more striking.


Turning her gaze toward Napier, she offered a polite nod to show her respect.


Napier addressed the room, saying, "Is there anyone else who wishes to bid on this tanzanite?"



Silence followed. Nobody answered, and not a single person made a move. After allowing about half a minute to pass, Napier gave a nod and continued, "Very well. I want to ask both of you directly, are you participating in this bidding of your own free will?"


Both participants signaled their agreement by raising their hands.


Napier lifted his own hand, and immediately, the lighting in the room shifted, transforming the entire atmosphere.


With the sound of a dramatic drumroll in the background, Napier spoke once more. "Everyone here should know that I am fully aware of both parties ' circumstances. I, Napier Evans, along with the Evans Group, promise that this auction is being conducted fairly,without any ill intentions."


People began glancing at each other, curiosity written across their faces.



This turn of events made everything even more captivating.


No schemes, no attempts at publicity-simply two determined bidders, each genuinely wanting the tanzanite for personal reasons.



Every single bid from bidder 823 must have come from sincere intentions.


Just what was happening in this auction? Brandon's brow tightened as he watched Millie stand so quietly across from him.



She did not return his gaze: instead, she simply lowered her eyes for a moment.


Napier had always known who she was. She once asked Charles to keep her identity a secret when she donated this stone to the charity auction tonight,but nothing could escape Napier's notice.


After all, Charles happened to be Napier's own grandson.


Perhaps Napier had even already figured out that the tanzanite was intended as a gift to mark the birth of her child.



Given all that, it made sense that she did not want her husband to win the stone, only for him to hand it over to another woman.


There was nobody who would find fault with her motives.



Yet,could it really be so simple?


Millie's eyes flickered with a touch of irony.



Even knowing there was no chance to win, she kept bidding with everything she had.



Millie knew better than to act recklessly. She lifted her head once more, her eyes locking with Brandon's as a faint smile touched her red lips.


He was watching her just as intently.


In that instant, it seemed like some unseen barrier separated the two of them from everyone else,leaving only the two locked in their silent battle.


A tense mind game had begun.



Brandon held the clear advantage with his fortune and influence, while Millie seemed wrapped in a quiet,mysterious confidence.



Brandon drew his brows together, deep in thought.



He found himself wondering who this woman really was.


Through all his years dealing with people in the business world, never had he met anyone quite so unpredictable.


Just then, Napier's voice carried down from above. "I will take charge and lead this next part of the auction myself."


The energy in the room spiked once more after a brief moment of calm.


"Mr. Evans himself is stepping in! When was the last time he did that?!" someone exclaimed.
"This really is a moment for the history books!"


"Do you think we'll see a repeat of those legendary auctions he ran twenty years ago?"


As another round of sharp, steady knocks echoed, the noise began to fade.


Every eye turned to the three focal points in the room:the elevated platform above, Seat 888, and Seat 823.


Napier's commanding voice rang out. "We are continuing with the bids. Bidder number 888 stands at twelve million dollars. Is there a higher offer?"
###Chapter 51 Her Game
As soon as Napier's words filled the hall, everyone's attention shifted back to the two prominent seats.


Brandon studied the woman nearby. She stood completely still, her true feelings hidden beneath her mask.



Business wvorld often felt like a battleground, full of strategy and subtle moves. For those at the center,mind games could make all the difference.


For Brandon, self-control was everything. Over time,he had mastered the art of staying unreadable, and that skill had helped him win many of these silent duels.


Nobody could tell what he was truly thinking, nor could they guess if his calm manner meant strong confidence or simply served as a bluff. At the same time, whenever he let any emotion slip, it was impossible to know whether he was accidentally exposing a weakness or deliberately setting a trap.



He always seemed to find a way to read his rivals,unraveling their strategies with ease.


However, the woman before him was different.


Brandon narrowed his eyes, determined to pick up on anything she might reveal.
Once Napier grew quiet, the spotlight shifted to the woman behind the mask.


Everyone watched as she lifted her gaze and looked straight at Brandon.


With a barely-there smile on her lips, she met his eyes.



She then slowly raised her right hand, and soon a new figure showed on the digital board.


"Fifteen million now from bidder 823!" Napier's calm,seasoned voice carried through the entire venue with ease.


That was over fifteen times more than where things had started.


The stone itself was worth just about one million,and now the price tag had soared to fifteen.


Earlier, the room had been full of noise and excitement, but now the silence was so thick, no one dared breathe.



Every person seemed frozen, all waiting to see what would happen next.


"Fifteen million from bidder 823. Will anyone else offer more?" At that, every gaze shifted back to Brandon.


He kept his face as unreadable as ever, though his right hand rose in response.
Brandon's calm voice rang out, saying, "Bidder 888matches with eighteen million dollars."


Eighteen million dollars!


A collective gasp swept through the audience.


A single tanzanite stone had now climbed to an astonishing eighteen million dollars.


And there was still no guarantee this would be the final price.


Napier wasted no time. "Bidder 888 stands at eighteen million dollars. Is there anyone willing to go higher?"The weight of his words seemed to hang over the room.


Once again, all eyes returned to the masked woman.


Would she actually push the bidding any further?


If she raised the amount yet again, could she handle the consequences of that choice?


Eighteen million dollars meant little to someone like Brandon,whose fortune was practically limitless.


He could easily choose to match or outdo her bid,especially if it meant putting more money toward charitable causes.


To Brandon, this sum barely made a dent. His personal contributions to charity in the past year alone
had already reached well over a billion. These included scholarships,projects for rural development, medical support for sick children, disaster relief, specialized schools, and many different funds.


Some donations had come from him alone or in his and his wife's names. Meanwhile, the Watson Group had supported an even wider range of charitable programs.


With all that wealth, Brandon might feel slighted enough to drive the price even higher,just to make things difficult for the woman across from him, or to tarnish her reputation.


Would she still be brave enough to make another move?


The air was thick with tension as the crowd stared at the masked woman, waiting for her next step.


Then, without the slightest hint of hesitation, she calmly lifted her right hand once more.

Napier's announcement rang through the hall. "Bidder 823 has offered twenty million dollars!"


Instantly, the mood in the room shifted.


People looked at the masked woman with new eyes.


She had to be out of her mind.


Did she genuinely have no fear at all?
Her rival was none other than Brandon.



Brandon had made it clear that he would not stop until the tanzanite belonged to him.


"Bidder 823 puts forward twenty million dollars. Do l hear anything higher?" Napier asked, steering the spotlight toward Brandon, yet every gaze remained fixed on the woman behind the mask.


Many thought she had completely lost her mind.


Most guests had the means to bid twenty million,considering only the most affluent and influential had been invited, but none felt they could match her boldness.



A chill flickered in Brandon's gaze.


He recognized her actions for what they were-a direct challenge.



With every confident and seemingly playful bid, she was testing him. This was not just about showing off wealth or power; it was about pushing the limits of his patience, as well as his authority as head of the Watson Group.



Brandon did not hesitate. He raised his right hand again.


"Bidder 888 is increasing the offer to twenty-five million dollars!"


Shock rippled through the crowd. Twenty-five million dollars!


Nobody in the room had imagined the bidding would reach such heights, except perhaps for one person.



"Bidder 888 is offering twenty-five million dollars. Is there anyone prepared to bid higher?" Napier called out.



The focus in the room stayed fixed on the masked woman.


Brandon watched her closely.



His gaze sharpened, and he tried to see past the mask,hoping to uncover the real reason for her daring bids.


Yet the woman only gave a subtle smile, then calmly lifted her right hand.



Instead of raising her bid, the masked woman gently pressed her right hand over her heart and gave a slight bow.


"You win," she remarked. "Congratulations, Mr.Watson."




Her calm words carried through the hall, leaving the audience in stunned silence.



Just as everyone expected her to keep fighting, she stepped back,handling her exit with unexpected grace.


It was as if she had been guiding every moment, with Brandon playing along in the story she set in motion.


The spotlight lingered on her, highlighting the elegance of her silver satin gown and her delicate silhouette.



Was this truly a loss for her,though?


All around, the room filled with whispers and glances as guests chose sides.


Some insisted that she had failed miserably, while those who understood better saw something entirely different.


She had just achieved a stunning victory in the battle of wills.


"We've now reached the final stage of bidding. Bidder 888 has offered twenty-five million dollars. Will anyone go higher?" Napier's voice cut through the tension, snapping everyone back to the moment.


Nobody answered.


Twenty-five million dollars was way more than most could imagine paying for a single tanzanite stone.


Napier called out, "Twenty-five million,first call."


Silence met his words.


He continued, "Twenty-five milion,second call."


Still, not a sound from the audience. Napier announced, "Twenty-five million,final call."


He allowed a few seconds to pass, but no one dared to make another offer.



At last, Napier brought down the gavel.


A spotlight caught both Brandon and the dazzling, rich blue tanzanite.



Napier announced, "The tanzanite has been sold for twenty-five million dollars! Please confirm your number again, 888. Congratulations on your new treasure."
###Chapter 52 She Knew Him Well
Brilliant flashes of light swept through the hall before settling into two beams that spotlighted both Brandon and the striking blue tanzanite.


While the room shone inside, fireworks erupted beyond the mansion's walls, lighting up the night sky in a burst of color that held everyone's gaze until the last sparks disappeared.


Inside, the lights grew even brighter, and suddenly the once-silent audience broke into thunderous applause and animated chatter, louder than anything that had come before.



The excitement was so overwhelming that the noise spilled out, reaching even those standing beyond the mansion's well-sealed doors.



"Something big must have just happened!"


"Check it out! We have been waiting for ages, and nobody is sharing any details!"



"Everyone who knows anything is staying tight-lipped.The wealthy crowd won't say a word, no matter how much money we offer!"


"What's really going on in there? I need to know!"
"Go get everyone else! As soon as this ends,we'll block every door and get the full story!"



"Absolutely!"


"Hurry and call everyone! The more people we have,the better!"



Reporters and paparazzi gathered outside, dialing their contacts and summoning more people and vehicles, determined not to miss a single detail.


The energy inside the mansion was even wilder.


"I can't believe I witnessed that! This is the kind of story I'll tell my family forever!"


"I feel the same! My heart's still racing. Whoever bidder 823 is, she has nerves of steel-even I have to admit I respect her."


"Mr. Watson put on quite a show too, outbidding everyone and taking home the prize. Those two were perfectly matched!"


"Honestly, I have to hand it to bidder 823. She stood her ground even without any advantage,outmaneuvered Brandon's strategies, and knew exactly when to bow out. That's inspiring!"


"Who could have imagined it? I thought it would be a routine auction for a plain tanzanite worth maybe a million, but it turned into something unforgettable!And Mr. Evans ran the auction himself-this is one for the history books!"


In the middle of all the applause and lively talk,Vivian's eyes lit up with excitement.


"Brandon, you really did all this for me..." A sheen of tears brightened her gaze. "Thank you, Brandon. I could die happy now."



Waves of emotion crashed over Vivian as she spoke.



For her sake, he had put on a dazzling show, pushing the price over twenty-five times higher than it began When the charity event ended, she knew she would be the talk of the city's social scene.



Millie's place in Brandon's life no longer seemed important.



It made no difference that Millie had once been his wife, or that she had spent seven years by his side,even carrying his child.


Nothing about Millie could match up to Vivian at this point.



She was convinced that the title of Mrs. Watson would belong to her sooner than later.


While Vivian expressed her gratitude, Brandon only spared her a glance and kept silent.



Earlier, he had asked Vivian if she liked the tanzanite,but after the break and his conversation with Serena,he somehow realized his bidding had nothing to do with Vivian.



His attention shifted to the woman who had quietly slipped back into the shadows, his eyes darkening with suspicion.



This woman had an uncanny way of unsettling his thoughts and shaking his resolve.



A simple conversation on the terrace had made him realize the stone wvas never about Vivian.



Every move at the auction, from the sudden bids to the silent challenges, she always seemed to have a plan,while he felt exposed whenever she was near.



A sharp glint crossed Brandon's eyes.



He had told her to stop bidding on the terrace,but maybe she had predicted every step from the beginning.


Right after he made his statement, she responded with perfectly timed bids of five and ten million, each jump calculated.



Once Napier appeared, their battle heated up. Her bids of fifteen and twenty mllion kept testing him,and she watched him closely each time, gauging his reaction until she finally bowed out at the perfect moment.



He realized she had managed to steer everything exactly as she wanted. Even as Brandon thought about all the money she had forced him to spend and the public spectacle she had caused, he could not bring himself to resent her.



If anything, he found himself in awe.



It was her bravery, her calculated approach, and the way she seemed to know exactly what was happening in his mind that set her apart.


He had walked away with the prize, but it felt like a loss in other ways.


She might have lost the bidding, but she had found her own victory by outsmarting him.


Who was this woman,really?


Up in the dimming mezzanine, Napier's gaze followed Millie as she slipped away into the shadows. "She truly is her father's daughter. If only he were still here..."


Darkness finally overtook the hall, and Napier's quiet sigh seemed to echo in the emptiness.


Life held no room for what-ifs. The reality remained that his own son had been claimed by the sea, and Millie's father had tumbled from a rooftop, dying right in front of his cherished daughter.



"Take me back. I feel so very tired." Napier's words sounded older than ever.



Time had caught up with him, leaving him just another elderly man nearing his eighth decade.


A loyal attendant gently wheeled him away.







On the second floor, Millie sat quietly in her seat.


Weariness swept over her, and she leaned into the sofa for support.


Her body had not yet recovered from the injuries caused by her recent fall from the stairs and miscarriage that followed.


Nearby,Charles had watched everything unfold,barely able to contain his excitement.



"Serena, I'm amazed by you!" Charles whispered,struggling to keep his voice down. "You managed to resolve things with my grandfather, and even when Brandon had every advantage, you turned the tables.There were moments I thought the situation was impossible, but you pulled it off. How did you manage all of this?"



Millie watched the scented candle on the table, its gentle flame filling the space with a soft, golden glow.


How had she managed all of this?



A memory of her father's kind smile flickered through her thoughts.



It was just that the weight of everything she had lost had become her greatest teacher.


Having once loved Brandon with her whole heart, she knew him better than anyone else ever could.



From the moment he confronted her on the terrace garden, she realized some things would never work out,yet she had chosen to see them through anyway.



Her childhood with the Bennett family and all the challenges she had faced shaped her. She was no longer just Brandon's wife at that moment-she stood proudly as Millie Bennett in her own right.


"But what happens to the tanzanite now?" Charles finally asked, worry coloring his voice. "Are we just going to let Brandon give it to Vivian?"


He remembered it was something Millie had set aside for the child she once hoped to have.


This auction had meant raising money for children in need, and since she lost her own child, Millie decided to donate the tanzanite to charity.



If Vivian were the one to claim it in the end...



Millie kept quiet for a moment, and then lifted her eyes to Brandon, who still lingered across the room.
###Chapter 53 The Group Photos
The charity auction pressed on.


Many more items were set to go under the hammer,with guests making occasional bids, though none matched the energy of the earlier showdown.



Millie waited quietly.


Her fingers drifted down the auction list until she paused on a certain entry. She tapped it gently, her interest clear.



Moments later, the announcer declared, "Up next, we have a six-carat ruby pendant..."


For the second time that night, Brandon joined the bidding.



He ended up securing the ruby pendant for twenty-eight million.



A faint smirk crossed Millie's lips.


Brandon had not changed at all.


She thought back to a month earlier, remembering how he dismissed the meaning behind tanzanite and turquoise birthstones. He said, "None of that matters.My child deserves the very best-like the pink diamond."



Millie could almost hear his thoughts now. "Only the finest ruby pendant is good enough for the woman l love. I would never give her a cheap,one-million-dollar-worth tanzanite. That would be beneath me."



The night continued to drift by, and at last, the final item was introduced.



"This last offering isn't a typical auction piece," the announcer explained. "It's a collection of twenty paintings, all created by children in need. Everyone may bid on one or more, and every dollar raised will go directly to charity."


Usually, auctions ended with something rare or extravagant. Tonight, the children's artwork, while not costly, carried a special weight.


Millie studied the paintings without lifting her paddle,number 823.


She turned instead to Charles, who sat beside her.


Catching her meaning, Charles leaned closer. "Which one do you have your eye on?"


Millie smiled softly and pointed to a picture displayed on the tablet. "This one by Ari Combs."


A single cactus stood beneath a bright sun-simple,childishly innocent, yet it spoke to her.


Charles nodded and raised his paddle to place a bid. Neither of them wanted to use number 823 again.


Still, as both were listed as invited guests, they each had their own paddle.


Charles' paddle, marked with the number 811, blended in easily, making it no problem for the two to sit together and take part. Mixing among the second-floor seats was a common practice, and no one minded if a guest joined from another table.


When the auction finally ended, the gala was nearly finished. Only the performances and a final group photo session remained.


Brandon usually avoided these photo sessions, but Vivian looked at him with such pleading eyes that he reluctantly agreed to join.


Everyone tried to put him at the center,but he only frowned and moved to the far end of the back row.



Millie stood with Charles at the opposite end, keeping as much distance from Brandon as possible.



The central spots quickly filled up as socialites scrambled for the best position.



"Everyone, eyes on the camera! On three-one,two,three!"



The first photo was taken.



"Let's try one more. One, two, three!" As the second picture was snapped, Brandon's patience wore thin, and for reasons he couldn't tell, he found himself glancing over at the pair standing across from him.



He saw the masked woman quietly leaning in to say something to Charles, a gentle smile on her face. She looked soft and relaxed-a far cry from her demeanor around himn earlier that night.


Brandon muttered to himself, "Charles finally brought someone impressive. His taste has improved."



The camera clicked again, capturing the moment.



Brandon shook himself from his thoughts and turned his attention back to Vivian, who was still completely caught up in posing.



"Last one! Everyone look this way!"



Millie's spirits soared.



Her phone vibrated with an alert-a payment had just come through.



She had once owned that tanzanite, and she had suggested to sell it to Charles so he could be the legit new owner and donate it to charity for her without revealing her involvement. Charles had agreed to help but insisted she keep the money.



At tonight's auction, the antique used to kick things off had 50% of the hammer price donated to charity, and the earning from the collection of paintings by the children showcased at last went entirely to charity.Except for these two, everything else followed the 70%donation rate-seventy percent went to the charity and the donor received remaining thirty.


For the tanzanite's twenty-five million sale, Millie would receive seven and a half million. She had to take out the taxes and pay for the commission fees and everything later, but still, she had enough left.


Evans Group wasted no time. They transferred the money to Charles, who then quickly sent the funds to her.



She intended to collect the cactus painting later.Keepsakes like that made perfect additions to her collection.



With a satisfied nod, Millie turned to Charles. "When all's said and done, things turned out just fine."


She had expected the tanzanite to be sold only a little more than a million; but now, even after the seventy percent donation, taxes and the commission fees, she still walked away with a comfortable profit.


Charles let out a sigh. "Still, he ended up with the tanzanite after all."



A gentle smile played on Millie's lips as she shook her head."Honestly, this is the best outcome we could hope for. The real purpose was to raise money for the children. I made a little on the side, and the charity funds got a nice boost too. Everybody wins."


A few days ago, she and Brandon had signed a property division agreement when filing for a divorce.


Since the Watson Group was such a major company,their prenuptial agreement focused on protecting its interests. She had willingly let go of plenty, just to make sure she could reclaim her family's old holdings with a small loophole in the contract.


Standing on the terrace garden during the intermission earlier, she had already decided that twenty million would be her absolute limit for bidding.



These thoughts drifted through her mind as she glanced toward Brandon, who stood at the far end of the room.



He was staring down at Vivian, his face giving nothing away.


The camera clicked again, capturing the third and final group photo.


"That's a wrap! Thank you, everyone!" the photographer called out, drawing Millie's focus back.


With the pictures finished, she and Charles headed for the exit.



Across the room, Brandon and Vivian found themselves surrounded.



"Mr. Watson, I represent a construction firm..."
"Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Watson. May I introduce myself?"


"Mr. Watson, if you have a moment..."



People kept trying to start a conversation with Brandon,but he hardly responded.



Soon enough,attention shifted to Vivian instead.



"You look stunning tonight, Miss Simpson. I've seen your stories online. You really inspire me."


"It's wonderful to see someone as compassionate as you supporting tonight's cause."



"Are you working on any new projects? Our company is starting something soon..."



Vivian greeted every compliment with an unfailing,pleasant smile.


Standing next to her, Brandon began to lose patience.His eyes wandered past the crowd and landed on Millie and Charles as they quietly slipped out together.


A sudden wave of annoyance crept up on him for reasons he could not quite explain.


He shifted his attention back to Vivian, who was still enjoying the attention of the crowd.



"It's time to go," he said.



Vivian paused, glancing at him. "Oh, all right."
The crowd stepped aside instantly, clearing a path for them.



Some guests lingered inside the villa, still trying to mingle, but the majority had already made their way out.



Outside, news crews stood ready with cameras and microphones at hand.



"Are they almost done in there?"



"Yeah, the last group photo just wrapped up. They'll be outside any minute now."


"Stay alert, everyone. The second they step out,grab the best angle!"


"Understood!"



Just then, the villa's heavy doors, shut tight all night,slowly began to swing open
###Chapter 54 Does This Signal Your Intention To...
No sooner had anyone stepped out than a wave of reporters surged forward, closing in on the mansion's front steps.



Bright flashes fired off relentlessly, and the noise from the shouting crowd made it almost impossible to think.


Microphones thrust forward, and voices competed for attention. "Can you share what just happened in there?"


Other reporters shouted over the din, "We could hear cheers from all the way outside! What's the story with the drones and fireworks? Please give us some details!"



Questions came from every direction. "Excuse me,one more question..."



The guests barely had time to get their bearings before they were boxed in by journalists desperate for any scrap of new information.



Most faces showed confusion, even among those who expected a little media attention; no one could have predicted such a mob.



Costumes of every color filled the scene, and someone even brought along a barking dog,which seemed just as interested as the press. The animal's barking grew louder every time someone glanced its way.



Camera flashes bathed the entryway in white light,turning night into day.



This was exactly what greeted Millie and Charles as they emerged from the mansion.



Surprise widened Millie's eyes, hidden just behind her mask.



She barely had a moment to process before a wave of reporters pressed in, some actually brandishing the dog as part of the spectacle.



A chorus of barking met Millie's startled gaze.



Cries rang out. "That's Serena Ellsworth!"



"Serena, can you share what just took place inside?"



"And Mr. Evans, your family's charity auction seems to have sparked quite the uproar. What happened?"



The flood of questions and people was unending.Charles set his jaw, gently shouldering his way through the mass to shield Millie.



Without hesitating, he pulled out his phone and tried to contact security.



Inside, new protocols had been set in motion. Extra guards were already on their way, summoned from nearby.



Unfortunately, reinforcements hit a wall-crowds blocked every route before they could even get close



Every inch of hillside around the mansion had become a trap, with reporters forming an impenetrable ring



Taking in the crush of bodies, Charles could hardlly contain his exasperation.



He barked into his phone, urgency in every syllable "Send the helicopter, now! The rooftop's big enough to land on. Just get it here!"



All the while, he kept Millie behind him, acting as her shield.



Rumors had spread like wildfire. Charles knew the second the media got wind of Serena and Brandon's confrontation, there would be no escape.



Shouts rose from the chaos. "We've got the story!Brandon just bought a tanzanite for Vivian! That's not all! Serena and Brandon started a bidding war-tanzanite that should be a million dollars went for twenty-five million!"



Another voice joined in, frantic. "Look, it's Serena!Hurry up, she's right there!"



The crowd reacted instantly, surging toward Millie and Charles as if driven by instinct.


With panic rising, they tried to retreat inside, but the way was blocked-people pressed in from every side,and even the dog wouldn't give way.



A new wave of excitement swept through as someone cried out, "Brandon's coming out, and Vivian's withhim!"


"Over here! They're heading this way, move, move!"


"No one gets through! Someone keeps the doors blocked too!"



In seconds, the mob redirected, trampling over each other to get closer to Brandon and Vivian.



Those who'd been guarding the back grumbled under their breath. "Just my luck! I ended up with Serena instead of Brandon!"



Unable to help himself, Charles scoffed, "If you're so desperate, try going after him instead of crowding us!"


Pandemonium reigned, shouts, flashes, and barking dogs blending into a single roar.


In an attempt to calm things, the mansion security blared the siren at full volume.



Chaos didn't budge. The noise did nothing to thin the wall of people pressing closer.


Vivian had just been swept up in a grand gesture-Brandon's wild bid that sent millions flying just to please her.



Meanwhile, Serena, known from her time on Heavenly Melody,went head-to-head with him in the auction.



There had to be headlines-bold,impossible to ignore,splashed across every front page!



But wasn't Serena still right there next to Charles?



Curiosity turned into interrogation as a reporter called out, "Serena, why did you try to outbid Brandon? Is there something going on between you two? What does that leave Mr. Evans?"


That question cut right through Charles. Was he just invisible now?



It felt like all his significance had been erased in an instant.



No one had ever made Charles feel so irrelevant before.



Unable to hold back, he snapped, "If you don't have real questions, keep your mouths shut and get lost!"


No one so much as glanced at him; his anger barely registered.



Instead, every camera, every light, every microphone was locked onto Millie.



There was no dodging the crowd this time, and Millie realized it was pointless to stay silent.


She took a breath and said to the reporters, "I bid against Mr. Watson because I genuinely wanted the item. That's all there is to it."



Skepticism rippled through the crowd.


Charles jumped in, voice raised. "Take it or leave it!The truth is, Serena and Brandon only ever crossed paths at the Heavenly Melody's first episode recording.Since then, there's been no contact. Something going on between them? You're just making up stories!"



A reporter turned to him. "Mr. Evans, why are you so upset? Is it because we're right about this?"


Frustration bubbled up, and Charles looked about ready to start swinging.


On the other side of the crowd, Brandon moved through the throng with an icy calm, his presence alone keeping people at arm's length.



Even surrounded by the press, Brandon's status created a clear bubble; no one dared get too close.



Planting himself firmly in front of Vivian, Brandon took on the role of her shield.



Questions rained down, relentless and sharp. "Mr.Watson, reports say you swore to win the tanzanite for Vivian, bidding against Serena and walking away with a $25 million price tag. Is it true?"



Another voice chimed in, "Is your bold move a declaration of love for Vivian?"



Flashes erupted as someone asked, "Does appearing here at the auction with Vivian mean you're finally going public with your relationship?"


Accusations came next. "Does this signal your intention to divorce your wife?"



Frowns creased Brandon's brow while he faced the barrage in stoic silence.



He chose not to dignify the chaos with a response.Vivian, on the other hand, had been waiting for just this moment.



She'd pushed for their attendance tonight precisely to capture this spotlight.



Turning to Brandon, Vivian offered a gentle, practiced smile."Let me take this one." With that, she slipped past him, stepping confidently into the reporters 'crosshairs.



Lights converged, and every camera swung in her direction.



"Everyone." Vivian managed a smile that suited the moment, though a hint of fragility lingered behind it.


"We came to this charity auction simply to show our support for children in need. As for Brandon making headlines..." She paused, letting her gaze sweep the crowd. "Well, wherever Brandon goes, attention follows, no matter how quietly he tries to act. There's no use pretending otherwise. About the tanzanite,yes,I was interested at first. It was valued at around a  million. Brandon's winning bid was simply his way of maximizing the donation. Please don't read too much into it. He's here tonight at my request to help bring awareness to these children. That's all. Please don't let wild rumors take hold."



A hint of fragility colored her smile as she continued."My health is failing. All I want is to do something meaningful while I still can. Serena just happened to want the same stone; there's no need to turn it into drama or drag her name through the mud."



Poised and gracious, Vivian finished her speech with a respectful bow.



Rising back up, she suddenly swayed, the color draining from her face, before she collapsed right in front of the crowd.

###Chapter 55 The Hollowness
Things on Vivian and Brandon's side had erupted into complete pandemonium.



When the dust settled, all Millie witnessed was Brandon sweeping Vivian into his arms and rushing her toward the villa's entrance.



The spectacle unfolded before more than just Millie's eyes-every single person present absorbed the dramatic scene.



Charles studied Millie's face, worry etching deep lines across his features.



Words pressed against his lips, demanding release,but the sea of reporters surrounding them forced his silence.Instead, he began barking at the crowd.



The Elliott siblings absorbed every detail of the unfolding drama. Jayceon's expression twisted into one of complete dismissal. His sister beside him also rolled her eyes with barely concealed contempt.



Each observer processed the chaos through their own lens of judgment.



Millie, however, simply pulled her attention away with studied indifference.



The man cradling Vivian against his chest might as well have been a stranger rather than the husband who had shared her life for countless years.The entire spectacle felt disconnected from her reality.



Sirens wailed from within the villa once more, their urgent cry soon joined by the rhythmic thrum of helicopter blades.


Millie tilted her head skyward and located the aircraft circling overhead like a mechanical vulture.



Charles positioned himself as her shield while they navigated toward the helicopter's landing zone.



Millie acknowledged his guidance with a brief nod, and then moved alongside the security team that had finally carved a path through the pressing crowd, all of them heading back toward the villa.


The Evans Group personnel, previously trapped behind the human barrier, had broken through at last,establishing clear corridors for the departing banquet guests.



The exodus began with surprising organization, and under the security team's watchful supervision, the dense crowd gradually dispersed into manageable streams.



As Millie placed her foot on the first step leading to the rooftop where the helicopters waited,she allowed herself one final backward glance.



Far below on the ground floor, the masses had formed a natural circle of space. Vivian had emerged from unconsciousness, and Brandon maintained his vigil beside her, his body angled toward hers as he murmured words meant only for her ears.



Every line of tension in his furrowed brow and the rigid set of his compressed lips painted a portrait of genuine anxiety for Vivian's wellbeing.


Charles traced Millie's line of sight, and then spoke with gentle firmness. "We should leave now."


Millie dropped her eyes and pivoted away,refusing to grant the scene below another moment of her attention.



"Okay," she responded, falling into step behind Charles as they exited through the passageway.


Down on the ground floor, Brandon's instincts stirred with an inexplicable awareness, prompting him to lift his gaze upward, but he discovered only the vacant entrance to the rooftop and the impenetrable darkness that stretched beyond it.



The helicopter's rotors thundered above him, their mechanical rhythm somehow amplifying the hollowness that had settled deep within his chest.


"Please forgive me for causing you such distress,Brandon," Vivian whispered from her position beside him, her voice barely audible over the chaos. "My eagerness got the better of me, and I crammed far too many events into today's schedule.Please forgive me. It's simply that...my remaining time grows shorter with each passing day, but I still have so much I wanna do..."



Brandon's forehead creased into even deeper lines,while an acute pain pierced through his heart like a blade. He moved his head from side to side in a gentle negation,his silent gesture conveying that no apology was necessary.



High above them in the helicopter's cabin, Millie fixed her gaze on the sprawling cityscape that stretched endlessly below.


The aircraft rose from the hillside villa's rooftop landing pad, soaring over the congested mountain roads toward the low-altitude corridor that the Evans family had secured through official channels.



Traffic remained locked in gridlock far beneath them,though a single lane had been carved out to allow vehicles to inch forward through the bottleneck.



Powerful downdrafts from the helicopter's spinning blades caught Millie's long hair and sent it streaming behind her like silk ribbons in a storm.



As she gazed down at the glittering metropolis,Millie couldn't quite grasp what thoughts were swimming through her mind. She simply felt bone-deep exhaustion wash over her.



Without warning,someone settled a jacket across her shoulders. The ganmont still held residual warmth, carrying with it the subtle fragrance of pine needles


She rotated her head to discover Charles, his hair tousled by the relentless wind, his eyes brimming with ummistakable concern.



His mouth moved as he attempted to communicate.but the helicopter's deafening roar swallowed every syllable She couldn't catch even a whisper of his words



Far below in the villa's expansive parking area.Brandon and Vivian had retreated to the sanctuary of their waiting vehicle.



After carefully settling Vivian into the front passenger seat. Brandon accepted a compact security case containing the evening's auction acquisitions from one of the Evans Group staff members.


He triggered the lock mechanism and lifted the lid for inspection. The tanzanite gemstone and the blood-red ruby pendant nestled safely in their protective foam compartments.



Brandon offered a confirming nod, signaling that he had verified the contents met his expectations.



He observed the Evans staff members as they departed, but made no immediate move to slip behind the wheel himself.


 
The Bugatti Centodieci waited in perfect silence,its sleek frame gleaming under the security lights Brandon cast a glance toward the reporters being restrained by the Evans Group's security team, and then allowed his gaze to drop downward.



With his lips compressed into a thin line, Brandon retrieved his phone from his pocket.



His long fingers began scrolling trough his message history, searching for something specific among the digital conversations.


He eventually located Millie's chat window.


Unlike every other conversation thread that buzzed with constant notifications, this one remained eerily quiet. Not a single message had appeared.



She still hadn't made any attempt to contact him.



"Brandon?" Vivian's voice drifted from the seat beside him, soft and questioning.


At some point during his contemplation, Vivian had slipped from the vehicle and now stood beside the front passenger door, her gaze fixed on him with eyes that still held the pallor of weakness.



"Has something gone wrong with the auction acquisitions?" Vivian inquired, her smile attempting to mask the fragility that clung to her features.


Brandon tucked his phone away with deliberate precision, shook his head in gentle dismissal, and  secured the portable safe back within the car's interior.



"I'll escort you home," he declared with quiet resolve.



"That sounds perfect," Vivian responded, her smile warming despite her obvious exhaustion.


The Bugatti began its descent down the winding mountain road, every other vehicle instinctively yielding passage to the luxury sports car.


Brandon's expression remained an impenetrable mask,his genuine emotions buried beneath layers of practiced composure, yet the helicopter's rhythmic rotor beats seemed to reverberate endlessly through his consciousness.




...



The guests departed in orderly fashion, and the once -chaotic, thunderous venue gradually surrendered to tranquil silence.



However, the digital realm was beginning to ignite with fevered discussions.



The evening's first wave of entertainment emerged from private wagering among the wealthy elite.



Two specific bets had centered around bidders 888and 823-the first concerning which participant would ultimately claim victory in the auction, and the second involving how many bidding rounds participant 823 would dare to continue once Brandon entered the competition.



The initial wager had been virtually guaranteed given Brandon's astronomical wealth, resulting in disappointingly low odds for anyone brave enough to place money.



The second bet had delivered the evening's genuine surprise. Not a single person had predicted the correct number of rounds, allowing the house to gleefully collect everyone's contributions.



"Bidder 823 demonstrated remarkable skill tonight.Not only did she outmaneuver Brandon in psychological warfare,but she also ensured that all of us lost our wagers spectacularly."


"Nevertheless, unlimited financial power remains undeniably impressive. When will I possess the ability to emulate Brandon's approach-dismissing all elaborate strategies and simply overwhelming opponents with pure monetary force? Regardless of how brilliant bidder 823's mind games proved to be,she still succumbed to the crushing weight of unlimited wealth."



"You speak as though unlimited wealth can be acquired as effortlessly as playground currency. Do you truly believe you can possess such power simply because you desire it?"


"Ha-ha. For Brandon, it essentially functions exactly like playground currency." "Your observation rings completely true."



Everyone continued their animated conversations,while the house operators beamed with satisfaction.



These wagers represented mere pocket change to the establishment, yet even modest profits brought genuine joy to the house's coffers.


Most significantly, that enigmatic masked woman had etched herself into the memories of countless high society members throughout the evening.



If her exclusive contract with Evans Entertainment hadn't been common knowledge, recruitment attempts would have begun flooding in from every direction.



Even though Evans Entertainment functioned as merely one division within the Evans Group's business empire,the Evans Group itself commanded respect as one of Crobert's three dominant powerhouses, and no competitor could guarantee superior contractual terms.



Naturally, this entire discussion remained confined within the exclusive circles of the social elite.



Any media coverage regarding the evening's events within the villa still required thorough review before receiving publication approval.


Meanwhile, the trending topics dominating online conversations	featured	hashtags	like	  BrandonDramaticGesture, quickly followed by #VivianFaintedFromExhaustion and #CharityWork.
The accompanying photographs captured drones illuminating the night sky above the Evans mansion with brilliant displays of light and cascading firework trails, as well as the pivotal moment when Vivian collapsed before the assembled crowd and Brandon swept her into his protective embrace.
###Chapter 56 She Felt Untouchable
Soon,this news spread all over social media.


"So Brandon won the tanzanite for Vivian by continuously raising the stakes?



"Yes!"



"Oh wow, this is basically him going public with their relationship! Brandon is doing everything for Vivian,like Millie doesn't even exist!"



"That tanzanite can't be worn yet, can it? It still needs to be made into jewelry. But with Vivian near the end of her life, she must've done it all for the charity."



"I can't even imagine how it'll feel for Brandon,staring at that gem after shne's gone."


"He should set it into her casket or something."



"Vivian has been running herself ragged lately.Fainting from exhaustion. And even before she collapsed, she was still asking the press to stop the speculation, to protect MAillie from the worst of it."



"She's too good. I'm sobbing here."



"How can one person be so selfless?"
"Millie, are you seeing all this? If you are, please,just divorce Brandon and let Vivian have him."



"She's just a housewife. What is she even compared to Vivian?"



Behind the scenes, Johnny was already on the move,instructing his team swiftly.


Soon, a post appeared. "Her kindness makes her an angel among us."


It painted a soft-focus portrait of Vivian-her love story with Brandon retold with cinematic flair,her goodness threaded through every paragraph.


Despite her terminal cancer, Vivian had kept working,fighting for sick children, showing up with a smile,doing what she could even as her body failed her.


And even then, she hadn't turned her illness into a weapon. She hadn't thrown darts at Millie. She'd been gracious.


Even at the auction, when Serena hiked the price up twenty-five times, forcing Brandon to pay an obscene amount, it was Vivian who spoke kindly of Serena, not scolding her, not making a scene.


The post even wove in hints of female strength,sketching Vivian as both gentle and unshakable. It struck a chord.



The moment the post went live, it stirred up a storm online.


People were crying and singing Vivian's praises. The hashtag, #SaintVivian, climbed the trending chart.


At the same time, an unconfirmed rumor began to circulate online, claiming that Serena had attended the charity gala without making any donation.


Although the gala was strictly by invitation, every guest was expected to give something-maybe buy a child's drawing or a small diary, nothing costly. To attend and give nothing was seen not just as selfish but almost like fraud.


The charity gala offered a number of ways to give.


First, the donors who provided items for the auction were automatically contributing, since 70% of all proceeds went to charity.


Second, the winners paid for what they bid on-another form of contribution.



Third,people could donate directly without bidding.


And often, those who won items still made extra donations. Like Brandon. After winning two lots, he gave even more.



No one was forced to give twice, but doing nothing at all-offering neither item, nor bid, nor donation-was shameful.Unforgivable,even.



Still, the rumor didn't spread. It stayed low, shared only among a few.


Most people were focused on Vivian and Brandon.


Even when the reporters published follow-up pieces,the spotlight didn't shift. It clung to them.


On First Avenue in Crobert, a Bugatti Centodieci sped by.


Vivian sat in the passenger seat, scrolling through her phone. A flicker of satisfaction moved across her face.


She sent a message to Johnny. "Keep the rumor about Serena going, but keep it low-key. I'll use it against her when the time's right."


After Johnny replied, Vivian tucked her phone into her bag.

Right now, she felt untouchable. Everything seemed to fall into place.


She thought about the past few days. Every move had been carefully planned, every outcome accounted for.


And that certainty gave her a high.



The car rolled to a stop at her apartment complex.


But Brandon remained seated, not getting out.


Neither did Vivian. She watched him.



Taking a long breath, Brandon reached into the back  seat and pulled out the safe containing the gemstones.



Vivian's eyes glimmered, but she looked down quickly,masking her anticipation.


She knew about the 6-carat ruby pendant. Brandon had won it during the auction. She wondered now if he meant it for her as well.


The tanzanite had fetched $25 million at auction, but everyone knew it was worth just a fraction of that.



Vivian wanted the ruby pendant more than the tanzanite.



It wasn't just more expensive; it was ready to wear,not a rough stone needing time.



Of course,having both would be perfect.



And now that Brandon had acted, she needed to follow through.



So,she pulled out her phone and began transferring money to Brandon.



"I only have 1.2 million available at the moment," she said as she made the transfer. "I'll send this first and settle the rest later."



Brandon blinked,jolting back to the present.



His fingers traced the faceted surface of the deep blue tanzanite before he reached in again and brought out the ruby pendant.


"No need," he said,handing the box to her.


"But I told you l'd pay," Vivian said, trying to sound insistent. "I meant to buy the tanzanite, not this ruby pendant."


She paused, and then slowly pushed the box back toward him. "I can't take this. It's too valuable."


Brandon didn't glance at her. His eyes were still on the tanzanite.


"It's a raw stone. Not ideal for wearing," he muttered,lying without a thought.


He shut the safe. "I think the ruby suits you more."


"Really?" Vivian asked, sounding eager.


Brandon looked down.


"Yes," he answered.


"So..." Vivian's heart stirred. She kept her eyes on the pendant. "Brandon, did you bid for it with me in mind?"


Brandon stayed quiet, not looking at her.


He turned toward the window instead.


Outside, the night was silent. The trees stood tall,their shadows long and faint beneath the streetlights.



It felt serene but hollow. "Yes," he said at last, barely audible.


And in that moment, he finally understood why Millie had been angry when, a month ago, he'd said, "My child deserves the very best."
###Chapter 57 The Most Beautiful Love Declaration
Without saying much, Brandon placed the safe holding the tanzanite back in the backseat.


He had never planned to give the tanzanite to Vivian.That was the whole point of bidding on the ruby pendant in the first place.


By handing her the pendant, he could easily spinsome weak excuse to hold on to the tanzanite.


What Brandon couldn't understand was why he even needed an excuse.



He had never needed to explain himself before.



·.·


Millie had already stepped off the helicopter. She was curled up in the back seat of the Maybach taking her to the hospital.


The car glided steadily while she curled up in the back seat.


"How do you feel? Are you okay?" Charles asked,concerned.



Millie nodded slightly to say she was okay and kept her eyes fixed on the passing street outside the window.



The gala had drained her completely. Her body was fine,but her mind felt like it had been through a storm.


The night was thick and quiet. Outside, gusts of wind whipped around tufts of willow fluff, stirring them into swirling little clouds along the pavement.



When was the last time she'd felt this worn out?



It must have been four years ago, in Proidan.



They had been on a massive cruise ship, caught up in a heated auction. Glasses clinked in the background while a man beside her gripped her hand tightly,raising the bidding paddle over and over.



While others hesitated, he moved in, again and again,his presence sparking another war of bids. Two men argued furiously, unaware that they were being carefully outmaneuvered-pushed and prodded by someone they couldn't even see.


He leaned close and whispered, "Letting your emotions run wild is the quickest way to lose in this game. Just watch them."



That year, they had partnered, working from different angles to stir the auction to chaos. They drained the main competitor's funds before the real prize even hit the stage.


And when it finally appeared, they took it without much resistance. Later, they slipped into a small waiting boat, auction item secured. Behind them, the ship descended into confusion, but she was steady beside him.



The wind on the deck that night had been harsh, but he shielded her from the worst of it.


He once told her he wasn't the kind of man who made romantic declarations-but she was in his future.


Back then, that had felt like the most beautiful love declaration.


To her, love meant being equal partners, pushing forward together. So she had always given her all.


But eventually,everything changed.



Millie shut her eyes.



Vivian had come into the picture.


Charles quietly told the driver to slow down. Then he pulled out his phone. He scrolled for a while, his frown deepening with every flick of his thumb.


Millie noticed. "What is it?" she asked, turning toward him.



Charles hesitated. He didn't want to talk about this.But Millie was looking at him.


And eventually, he figured there was no point hiding it.With how fast everything moved online, she'd find out soon anyway.


So he handed her the phone.


Millie took it and scrolled through the feed.


Beside her, Charles could barely keep still. "Do you see this nonsense? Why aren't they praising you for standing up to Brandon, for staying strong through all of this? Why is it all about Vivian? And now they're spreading rumors that you faked your donation? What rubbish! That tanzanite is yours. You gave way more than Vivian ever did. If anyone's riding on someone else's reputation,it's her!"


The more he spoke, the more his anger rose.


"We never even invited Vivian. She just showed up,"Charles continued. "I double-checked; she didn't make any donation afterward. She was just tagging along with Brandon."



Millie read everything quietly, and then passed the phone back to him.



"She's close to Brandon. People just assume the donations are from both of them," she said softly.


"But..." Charles opened his mouth to argue but didn't say anything.


He had wanted to point out that thedivorce hadn't been finalized, that technically, Brandon was spending money that still belonged to both of him and Millie. But the words didn't come.



He didn't want to hurt her further.



Still,Millie understood what he was thinking.


She gave a small, dry smile. "We signed a prenup.
There are a lot of things I can't take with me."


When she noticed the way Charles scowled,she added,"That's how big families operate, isn't it? I bet the Evans family isn't any different. And about the online rumors, I haven't decided to reveal my identity yet."


Charles gave a slow nod.


He knew that already. And he hated how unfair it all felt.



Millie could sense that Charles got what she meant,so she turned and kept her eyes on the window.



Charles glanced sideways at her, and then looked away.


If only he were powerful enough, if he had the strength to kick out his two older brothers and take control of Evans Group. If his voice carried weight with their grandfather. Then maybe Millie wouldn't have to face all this alone.


His hands clenched at his sides.


Outside, the night held a solemn silence. The car sliced through it, the road lined with swirling tufts of willow fluff, the hospital drawing closer.


Elsewhere, in the back seat of a Bentley, the Elliott siblings sat together.


Adriana scrolled through post after post, her face cold,her mouth twisted in disdain.



Jayceon suddenly shouted, "These people are really missing the point! All this fuss over Vivian! What about Serena's talent? That's what should be trending!"



Adriana shot him a glance. "You might get it,but most people aren't thinking that deeply. They're just chasing gossip. They don't care about what went down at the auction."



Jayceon crossed his arms, scowling. Still, he just didn't like Vivian.



He muttered, "What does she even do, besides marketing herself? If she's sick, get treated. If it's incurable, get the best care. She's already clinging to Brandon; she'll never be short of money. But what's the point with this daily drama? Isn't she supposed to be so kind? Kind to everyone but Millie-ouch!"



Adriana had reached over and smacked the back of his head.



Jayceon winced. "You hit me again!"


Adriana said, rolling her eyes, "You talk too much.It's exhausting."
Seriously, can't you go easy on me for once? I'm your brother!"



"I'm hitting you because you need it," she snapped."Yes, I know you can't stand Vivian. I don't like her either. But if you only look at what's in front of you,you'll miss the real game."


She turned to their older brother with a nod. "Vivian's got good instincts, sure, but someone's helping her.She's not doing all this alone."


Jayceon frowned,confused.


Adriana sighed. "Listen. Everything she says sounds gentle. She treats Millie with polite distance. She doesn't openly challenge Serena. But in the end,people online still turn on both of them. That's not a coincidence. That's coordination. It's her words,yes.But it's also a marketing team, crafting the image and planting the narratives."
###Chapter 58 Quiet And Hollow
Jayceon finally gave a slow nod,realization settling across his features.


Beside him, the other man hadn't said a word the entire time.



Each second dragged by.


While online debates grew more intense, several things began unfolding at once.


Before the charity gala, Alexia had asked Giffard to find an IT expert to help them restore the cellphone data. So far, there hadn't been any progress.


Elsewhere, Seville had managed to obtain footage from the Heavenly Melody live.



But because the recording had been done in secret-with the phone stashed under a seat-none of the stage activity was visible. The surrounding conversations were captured too, rendering the clip noisy and difficult to make sense of.


Running out of options, Seville turned to his older brother.


He handed over the file. "Hey, think you can help me with this?"
The man in black-rimmed glasses turned to face his brother. "What kind of help?"


"I need the background noise removed. Just leave the singing intact." Seville tapped the screen to play the video.


After listening for a moment, the man adjusted his glasses. "I write code. That's it. I'm not a wizard."


Seville let out a laugh. "Oh, come on. You're one of the best data specialists in the country."



The man let out a slow breath. "Only when it involves numbers. Fine, leave it here. I'll try."



"Appreciate it!"


Still, Seville wasn't relying on just that. He came up with not one, but three plans.



The audio hadn't captured anyone's face, after all.Even if his brother worked magic, there was no way to extract a clear identity from nothing.



So,he decided he'd attend the event again. This time,his setup would be better concealed, and he'd record everything without being noticed.


While waiting to hear back from his brother,Seville scoured the Internet for other recordings from the event. An original video of the Serena's performance would still be the strongest piece of evidence to back his claims.
In another part of the city, inside a cramped room,a handful of people sat huddled around screens, their attention fixed on the flood of online posts about Vivian and the charity gala.


They replayed multiple leaked clips from devices secretly planned on the show Heavenly Melody's backstage, picking through the chaos and drawing their own conclusions.


First, it seemed Serena had recently miscarried, a shocking detail.


Second, Vivian and Serena apparently shared a mutual enemy. The audio was messy, but someone seemed to mention Millie. Could it really be her?What had gone wrong between Millie and Serena?


Third, Vivian appeared to be blackmailing Serena,but what was the reason?


The group exchanged thoughts.


"So, what's our next move?" one of them asked."Clips like these could sell for a fortune."


Another reached over and knocked him lightly on the head. "Think bigger. Vivian's public image is all sunshine and grace, but these clips tell a different story. We don't know her motives, but it's clear she wants to keep this quiet. The more we gather,the more power we'll have when it's time to negotiate."

Their leader drummed his fingers on the table. "And don't forget Serena. She plays everything close to the chest. I wouldn't be surprised if she's hiding something major."


He leaned forward. "For now, we keep everything under wraps. You saw what happened during the live stream, someone tried to challenge Vivian and got shut down instantly. We'll wait, stay low, and make it count when we strike. Otherwise, we risk getting caught in the fallout."


He added, "Keep tabs on Millie too. She's married to Brandon. That might give us something useful to start with."



"Understood,boss!"



...


Somewhere else in the city, a man stormed out of his temporary lodging for the past few days, his frustration barely contained.


"You have no right to do this!" he yelled. "Vivian's rivals must've paid you off!"



He was one of Vivian's most loyal supporters.


He admired her deeply and never missed the opportunity to speak of her brilliance to anyone who'd listen.



So when Vivian ignored a question about the demo, he happened to know some people and took it upon himself to raise the topic during the live broadcast.


There was still time left before the stream ended.



Online discussions about the demo were heating up."Yesterday" was gaining momentum back then and beginning to rival "Glimmer of Love."


But to him, Vivian's song was unmatched. He believed in her completely and wanted "Glimmer of Love" to dominate the spotlight. If he could get her to speak on the record-just one confirmation about the demo -it would spark even more attention and push her song to the top.


He never got the chance. Someone must've figured out what he was up to, because he was quietly pulled out of his own home and taken to another place before he could say anything.


"You'll see!" he snapped as he stormed out.


He wasn't backing down. One missed opportunity wasn't going to stop him. He'd find another way to support Vivian and raise the demo's profile.




...


At the police station, Lynda stood at the center of a tense investigation into Millie's car crash.



A colleague walked in holding a folder.



"Lynda, new update. You'll want to see this." The colleague passed her a file tied to the charity gala.


Lynda's expression tightened as she flipped through the pages.


Noticing her expression, the colleague added, "These two are acting strangely. Brandon and Millie might have filed for divorce, but it's not finalized yet. And now these two keep pushing her, don't they realize Millie could easily call off the whole thing?"


And that was exactly the issue.


Before everything was finalized, either person could withdraw and halt the proceedings at any moment.


Were Brandon and Vivian not concerned that Millie might change her mind out of nowhere? Or perhaps they were, and they already had plans to ensure she wouldn't.



Lynda sat quietly, and then lowered her eyes to the list of strategies noted in her planner.


After a moment, she tapped one of them. "This one,"she said.



Her colleague gave a firm nod.



...


Time moved on.



After dropping Vivian off, Brandon headed back to the apartment adjacent to his company building.
The moment he walked through the door,he spotted Eugene waiting.


Brandon paused, slightly surprised.


Eugene greeted him with an easy smile. "Mr. Watson,I've replaced all the items that were missing."


That explained it.


As head of the secretariat, Eugene oversaw two branches-one for company operations, the other for Brandon's private affairs.



Millie used to manage both aspects, juggling his schedule and personal life without issue. But with the tension between them lately, Eugene had stepped in to handle things temporarily.



Brandon gave a brief nod and glanced around the apartment.


His suits were back in the closet, neatly arranged alongside his ties, watches, and shoes. Socks and other essentials had been sorted and placed just the way he liked them.


The household staff worked quietly in the background,putting everything in order.


It was efficient. Familiar. Exactly how it should be.


"Alright," Brandon said before heading into the shower.
By the time he came out, the apartment was empty again. Eugene and the staff had already left.


Standing alone in the living room, Brandon suddenly noticed just how still everything felt.


There was no one waiting on the couch, flipping through a book. No voice calling his name.


No warmth in the quiet. The space felt hollow.


He reached for his phone and tapped back into Millie's chat.



Still nothing.



For a second, he wondered if something was wrong with the phone.
###Chapter 59 Her Kiss And Warmth
Brandon made his way across the room to where he had secured the safe.


His fingers worked the combination with practiced ease, and he retrieved the tanzanite from its velvet-lined interior.


Under the ambient lighting, the precious stone erupted into dazzling brilliance, casting violet-blue fire across his palm.


He stopped mid-motion, his mind churning with uncertainty, and then quickly captured a photograph of the gem and pulled up his chat thread with Millie.


"The tanzanite that caught your eye." He typed carefully, his thumb hovering over the send button.But something held him back, a nagging doubt that crept through his chest. In the end,he erased every word.



The memory surfaced wit painful clarity-Millie had desired this particular tanzanite because, should she conceive in March, the anticipated delivery would arrive in late December, making the stone a perfect birthstone match. But the harsh reality crashed over him like a cold wave-they had never conceived a child. Fragments of that pivotal night flooded his consciousness: her radiant smile, the softness of her lips against his, the tiny mole adorning her chest, the intoxicating warmth of her skin against his, and then the heart-wrenching moment when tears of ecstasy streamed down her face as she pushed him away,whispering that she couldn't continue.


Brandon set his phone aside and collapsed onto the sofa's plush cushions, his gaze fixed on the stark whiteness of the ceiling above.



What occupied her thoughts at this very moment?With the Internet ablaze with controversy, she had undoubtedly witnessed the chaos. Why hadn't she broken her silence to contact him?



Had she truly grown wiser, mastering the art of patience and choosing to endure these next six months in quiet dignity? Or perhaps this represented yet another manifestation of her stubborn displeasure?


Brandon's eyes drifted to his phone, his mouth forming a rigid line of frustration.


Time seemed to dissolve around him, minutes blending into an indistinguishable haze.


Eventually, he retrieved his phone once more and permanently erased the tanzanite's photograph he took minutes ago.
Meanwhile, across the city at the private medical facility, Millie had made her way back to the sanctuary of her designated room.


After enduring a grueling and emotionally draining night, she finally experienced a measure of tranquility settling over her weary spirit.


Charles had departed to address pressing corporate matters. Before his exit, he had offered Millie a reassuring promise. "I'm going to force Oakley out of the picture. At the earliest, he'll be eliminated by the second Heavenly Melody live broadcast-at the very latest, before the third one. His reign of chaos at Evans Entertainment is rapidly approaching its final curtain call!"



Millie had voiced her unwavering support for Charles ' decisive action without a moment's hesitation.


They now found themselves allied in the same precarious vessel. She had finally seen through Napier's carefully constructed facade and recognized his true nature. Both she and Charles grasped the fundamental truth that only victory or defeat awaited them. No neutral territory existed in this battle.


Not long after Charles' departure, Alexia entered the room, cradling a neatly packed food container in her arms.


"Hey Millie, you've returned so late this evening. You must be absolutely famished." Alexia's face brightened with genuine warmth as she extended the container toward her friend. "These dishes are gentle on the stomach, absolutely perfect for a late-night meal."



Alexia began arranging the various food items before Millie with methodical care.



Observing Alexia's devoted attentive ministrations,Millie felt a bittersweet ache settle deep within her heart.



She could hold anyone accountable for her devastating miscarriage except Alexia. If Alexia hadn't orchestrated the emergency blood donation arrangements in advance, Millie might have succumbed to catastrophic blood loss. Yet Alexia perpetually shouldered the burden of guilt, carrying it like a stone in her chest.


Millie had exhausted countless approaches to alleviate Alexia's overwhelming remorse, but her efforts had fallen short every time.



So she permitted Alexia to assist in whatever manner brought her comfort,desperately hoping it might ease the torment weighing on her friend's heart.


"You've grown so alarmingly thin recently, and it breaks my heart to witness your suffering. You absolutely must nourish yourself properly and rebuild your strength," Alexia declared, her worry etched clearly across her features.
Millie offered a gentle nod and sampled the carefully prepared meal.



The flavors exploded across her palate with remarkable richness.



"By the way, Alexia, where on earth do you and your brotherdiscovertheseextraordinaryculinarycreations?"Millie inquired, her curiosity having festered for weeks."I questioned Giffard during our last conversation, but he remained mysteriously silent. I remain uncertain whether his silence stemmed from forgetfulness or deliberate evasion."



Alexia simply beamed at her with knowing eyes. "Does it satisfy your taste buds?"



Millie nodded enthusiastically, holding nothing back in her praise. "We've shared countless childhood memories and dined at some of the most prestigious establishments in the city, but nothing remotely compares to the extraordinary cuisine you two have been delivering to me lately. It's genuinely transcendent."



Alexia's expression transformed into one of mischievous delight. "As long as these meals bring you joy!" However, she steadfastly refused to reveal the tantalizing secret.



Millie fixed her with a penetrating stare and playfully tapped Alexia's forehead with her index finger.
"Something peculiar is definitely occurring here,"Millie announced with mock accusation. "These dishes don't originate from any commercial restaurant, do they? Speak truthfully-did your family recently employ a new culinary artist? Are these the chef's signature specialties?"


Alexia shielded her forehead defensively, shot back a withering glare, and formed an exaggerated pout."Something along those lines, I suppose. Regardless,if you crave more of these meals, I'll request that he prepare them specifically for you."


"Very well," Millie conceded gracefully, allowing the mysterious topic to drift away naturally.


They engaged in animated conversation for an extended period.



Observing Alexia's endearingly bashful and somewhat clumsy mannerisms, Millie released a profound sigh.



After allowing her thoughts to crystallize for several contemplative moments, she ventured, "Would you consider granting me a personal favor?"



Alexia responded immediately with an emphatic nod."Anything for you."


"In just a few days, the second live broadcast of Heavenly Melody will command the stage," Millie explained, her gaze searching Alexia's face intently."Would your schedule permit you to attend and witness my performance on stage?"


"Of course! I'll rearrange my entire schedule to be there!" Alexia declared with immediate conviction.Even if prior commitments had existed, she would have negotiated shift exchanges with colleagues to create the necessary time. She added breathlessly,"I've been desperately longing to experience the magic firsthand!"



Alexia then protested with genuine bewilderment."That hardy qualifies as a favor."



Millie reached out and gently poked her friend's cheek with affection.



"It absolutely constitutes a meaningful favor," Millie responded, her smile radiating warmth and sincerity."Nobody else in that audience knows I'm Millie. You alone hold that secret. It transforms the entire experience into something profoundly meaningful-it simply feels extraordinarily special."



Millie paused and then continued, her voice taking on a more serious tone, "And there exists one additional request.I desperately need your help to find someone and address the audio and video quality issues that have been plaguing the precious live broadcast."



Witnessing Alexia's unbridled eagerness and devotion,Millie recognized that she needed to orchestrate something meaningful to finally ease Alexia's troubled conscience. She refused to allow her dearest friend to remain trapped in perpetual unease, constantly treading carefully around her as if navigating a minefield.



They existed as equals in this friendship. Neither person owed the other any debt of gratitude or obligation.



Therefore,resolving the live show's technical audio and video challenges would serve as that transformative "something."



Once Alexia successfully conquered that complex problem, perhaps her lingering guilt would finally dissipate,and their cherished relationship could return to the natural harmony they had shared before tragedy struck.



Moreover,Alexia had already secured possession of Tia's phone. The moment they located a skilled data recovery specialist, every piece of the puzzle would click seamlessly into place.


"Perhaps if you immerse yourself more deeply into this project, that persistent issue will reach its resolution sooner?" Millie suggested, her smile carrying both hope and encouragement.


"You're absolutely correct!" Alexia responded with a vigorous nod, her expression radiating newfound determination and unwavering resolve.


With that reassuring exchange, Millie felt the tight knot of anxiety in her chest begin to loosen considerably.


Charles could later orchestrate the acquisition of a premium ticket for Alexia to witness the spectacular performance firsthand.


Time accelerated relentlessly as everyone threw themselves into intensive preparation.


Throughout the preceding days, Millie had maintained consistent communication with her team's borilliant mentor,Alex.



Although their creative visions occasionally collided in passionate disagreement, the resulting artistic friction invariably ignited fresh explosions of innovative inspiration.



This dynamic collaboration made Millie feel as though they had discovered each other tragically late in their respective careers.



Alex echoed these sentiments repeatedly with genuine enthusiasm.



And he even mentioned that once Millie's physical condition returned to its former vitality, perhaps they could collaborate on something even more monumentally ambitious.


At Evans Entertainment, Charles continued his relentless battle against his two scheming brothers,yet simultaneously, he had commissioned a show- stopping performance ensemble for Millie's upcoming Heavenly Melody live appearance.


The creation was, once again, absolutely breathtaking in its artistic magnificence.



As for Vivian, she had retreated into comparative silence. She proclaimed that she had collapsed from complete exhaustion following all the previous intensive marketing campaigns and desperately required extended recuperation.


Nevertheless, she remained a constant fixture at the Watson Group headquarters, perpetually stationed by Brandon's side like a devoted shadow.



This conspicuous arrangement even generated sensational headlines on multiple occasions.



Derek, meanwhile, continued nursing his bitter resentment and delivering Brandon the frigid treatment of deliberate indifference.



Amidst all this swirling chaos, the thirteenth day after Brandon and Millie filed for divorce finally arrived with startling swiftness, which coincidentally happened to be the exact date of the second electrifying Heavenly Melody live broadcast.
###Chapter 60 Teasing Her Silly Brother
The debut broadcast of Heavenly Melody had everyone glued to their screens, thanks in part to Brandon's appearance. Now,the second live show had turned into a magnet for the city's most influential people.


Evans Entertainment sponsored the event, and their own artist Serena was one of the most talked-about contestants, so it was only natural for Charles to attend.



With Vivian showing up, it was almost guaranteed that Brandon would be there as well, especially since he had not missed the first broadcast.


What really surprised everyone was the arrival of the Elliott siblings. Not only did Jayceon bring his trademark energy, but Adriana and even the usually elusive Myron made an appearance.



The result was a rare sight-every major force in Crobert was represented in the same place.



This sort of gathering had never happened before.



No entertainment show had ever attracted the attention of all three leading families in town at once.
Even a few seconds of footage showing them entering the building already sent the Internet into a chaos.



As the Elliott siblings walked past Brandon,Myron gave a small nod in his direction.


Brandon's brows drew together in response.


"Hey,Brandon!" Jayceon called out with his usual enthusiasm.



Adriana also greeted Brandon, though her voice stayed cool and reserved. "Mr. Watson."



Brandon gave a nod in return and focused his gaze on Myron,his eyes quietly searching for answers.


"I'm just here with my siblings to see what's happening,"Myron replied in a straightforward tone.



Jayceon chimed in right away, his voice bubbling with excitement, "I heard Serena-the star of the last charity auction-is performing. I just had to check it out, so I dragged Adriana along. Of course, she gets annoyed with me easily..."


He shot Adriana a wounded look, and then continued with a playful grin, "So I made sure to bring Myron, too.That way, Adriana had no choice but to tag along.Hehe...ouch!"



Jayceon wore a mischievous grin until his sister reached over and gave him a poke on the forehead.
Adriana offered a polite smile and said, "Mr. Watson,he's always this way. You can just ignore him."


Brandon took it all in stride, knowing full well that Jayceon's playful side was common knowledge.


The Elliott family had a reputation for being both disciplined and very close. In their case, having a lighthearted little brother was almost a blessing,especially when compared to the ongoing drama in the Evans family.


Noticing the group gathered together, Vivian stepped forward to join them.



She kept her style soft and refined, and this time she wore the pendant from the charity gala-the gleaming 6-carat ruby pendant.


Vivian greeted the two Elliott brothers with a friendly smile. "Hello,Myron. Hello, Jayceon." Then she turned her attention to Adriana and added, "Adriana, you look wonderful today."


Adriana felt a flash of surprise and annoyance. In her mind, Vivian was always good at making herself look charming in public, but the way Vivian addressed her didn't sit well with her.


Most people addressed her as "Miss Elliott," and she barely knew Vivian outside of these social events, so they were clearly not close enough to use first names.



Still,given Vivian's fragile health, Adriana decided not to make an issue of it.



She gave a small nod in reply, and the rest of the group did the same, motivated by both respect for Brandon and the Elliott family's values, as well as awareness of Vivian's condition.



The group shared a few more words before everyone settled into their seats, with little conversation after that.



Out of sight from the others, Vivian's lips curled in a faint smile as she glanced at a dimly lit corner.



A discreet "OK" sign caught her eye, and she allowed herself a moment of satisfaction.



Everything seemed to be falling into place just as she hoped.



Vivian turned to Brandon with a look of polite gratitude, her voice carefully measured. "Brandon, I honestly didn't think you'd make time to be here today. It really means a lot to me."


Brandon answered with a simple nod,which seemed to satisfy Vivian.


After exchanging a few words, Vivian excused herself and made her way backstage to get ready for the show.



Just then, a video clip started circulating online.


The footage, shot from afar, captured Vivian chatting with Brandon and the three members of the Elliott family, all of them appearing friendly and relaxed.



A bold caption ran across the screen, saying, "Vivian has officially joined the ranks of high society;the Elliott siblings showed up at the live broadcast just for her."



That single video set off a fresh wave of online chatter about Vivian.



Strict rules about electronic devices only applied to regular audience members, leaving people like the Elliott siblings free to use their phones as they wished.


Jayceon quickly caught wind of the viraL post. He scowled at his phone and showed it to his siblings."Who took this video? It's ridiculous!"



Myron stayed quiet, showing no reaction, while Adriana shrugged and replied, "There's always some rumor going around here and there. You shouldn't let it get to you."


Still, her eyes narrowed thoughtfully as she glanced toward the backstage area where Vivian was preparing.



Adriana could not help but wonder if it was really all just a coincidence.



Jayceon, unaware of the tension, kept talking. "You're right. Last time they wrote nonsense and tried to match me with the McCoy daughter, her brother came to confront me, and I almost had a heart attack."
That sparked Adriana's curiosity. "So, what did you think of her? If you actually liked her, why not spend more time together?"


Jayceon flushed with embarrassment. "Adriana!"



Her laughter bubbled up as she continued to tease her younger brother.


Spending time with him felt like playing with a big,cheerful golden retriever.


Still, those moments hardly mattered in the grand scheme of things.


Everyone's attention stayed fixed on the competition.



Now that the eliminations were about to start, the outcome would depend on a mix of votes from the judges, the live audience, and online viewers, all tallied during the broadcast to decide who would have to leave.



Because of that, the order in which contestants performed was more important than ever.


Millie was set to go on stage fifth, landing her right in the middle of the lineup.


The latest Heavenly Melody broadcast was as dazzling as the last.


All the contestants showed clear improvement over their first live appearance. Every performance was thoughtfully planned and visually appealing.


That level of quality came about, at least in part,because Vivian had decided not to pull any strings this round, a fact that the audience never realized.



Millie chose a gentle rock ballad called "Us" for her performance.


Her outfit, though much simpler than what she wore before, worked well with the stage's shifting lights.She sang in a soft voice, letting the music tell a moving story.


The song traced the journey of a young couple getting by with very little, relying only on each other as they faltered and struggled in life.


Over time, as life moved on, they ended up going separate ways and leaving behind the person they once cherished most.


Although it sounded like a cliche story about love facing hardship,Millie's honest lyrics, storytelling style,and the subtle rock melody gave it a quiet sadness that lingered with listeners.


She sat at the piano in a flowing gown, her figure lit by cool shades of blue, her song gentle and sincere.



The peaceful mood she created was enough to bring many in the audience to tears.
###Chapter 61 Hold Me, Will You
From his seat among the special guests, Brandon kept his eyes on the woman performing, but his thoughts wandered to memories from long ago.


The journey of turning Wason Group into a leader in high-tech industry had not come easily,especially moving away from old business models.


One particular night from the past stood out,when he finally decided to make the change-fully aware that the road ahead would be full of challenges.



Luckily, Millie had stood beside him during those difficult tmes.



Throughout the year, the two of them bounced from one city to the next, sometimes even crossing borders into different countries.


He could not forget that one winter they landed in Eldoria for a big negotiation, only to realize they had walked right into a dangerous trap.



They barely got away, forced to escape by taking a boat out to sea.


That winter had been brutally cold, the ocean unforgiving and the small boat tossing about on the  waves.



They found the ship's conditions nearly unbearable yet couldn't really complain since they were running for their lives.



There was no cell phone signal so far from shore, and every minute left them guessing what would happen next.



For twelve long hours, they had no one but each other.


Cold air filled the cramped cabin.


Both of them layered on every bit of clothing and every blanket, yet the chill kept seeping in as they huddled together, shivering.


He noticed her lips starting to turn a pale purple hue from the cold, and he knew he looked just as bad.



His chest was tight with frustration-he was furious for being careless, furious at his own weakness, and worst of all, for putting her in danger too.


She seemed to sense what he was feeling. Quietly,she reached out and took his hands in hers.



A small voice broke the silence. "Brandon, I'm freezing,"she whispered, pulling him out of his worries. "Are you cold too?"



He met her eyes and gave a silent nod. She understood him better than anyone. She never tried to offer empty comfort. Instead,she shifted his mind away from his fear.


He realized, too, that if they made it toland,they would be safe. But if the weather got worse, there was a real chance they would never be found.



The endless waiting, the constant suspicion,and the swirling anxiety all felt almost too much to bear.


Even so, she managed to smile and leaned closer."Hold me, will you?" She continued, "If we stay close,maybe we'll feel a bit warmer."



He responded right away, gathering her into his arms.


Outside their tiny cabin, snow drifted over the restless sea. Winter pressed in, with seagulls flying past and their calls echoing through the chilly air.


Beyond the small window, the world appeared in shades of cold gray and blue.


Inside, they pressed together beneath a blanket as the boat rocked, finding comfort in each other.


Her scent stayed with him-he could still remember the soft fragrance of her hair.


She fit perfectly in his arms, small and delicate,but her presence made him feel steady.


Their heartbeats seemed to fall into the same gentle rhythm, and for a while,the cold faded away.


He placed a gentle kiss on her forehead and whispered,"We're going to make it through this."


Soft words spilled from her lips, soothing his worries.



···


At the live show, Adriana's eyes shimmered with unshed tears. Jayceon had already started sniffling,dabbing at his face.


Adriana gave him a light smack.


"Would you quit whining already?" she muttered to herself.



Jayceon's voice wobbled as he protested,"I can't help it! It's just so moving. Please don't hit me!"


Adriana shot him a look. "I only tapped your shoulder."



"Oh...I thought you were actually hitting me,"Jayceon murmured, his voice still shaky with tears. "I heard every contestant tonight is singing something they wrote themselves. Their mentors step in to help,but this show really depends on the performers' own music."



He lowered his voice and asked, "What must she have gone through to write a song like that?"



Brandon caught Jayceon's words. His eyes stayed fixed on the woman singing under the stage lights.


The memory of her debut performance in the show flashed through his mind, along with their confrontation at the charity gala.


Truly, how many battles must a woman face before she could rise to this kind of strength?



She presented herself as strong and completely self-reliant,never showing a need for help, always handling everything alone.


For some reason, that independence only made people care about her even more.


The gentle rock elements of her music took away some of the sorrow. Maybe, like her, the music reflected a calm acceptance after a lifetime of struggle.


Her voice never rose into dramatic cries, but her song could keep listeners awake long into the night.


Brandon turned his attention to Charles, who stood near the edge of the stage.



Had Charles been the one to guide Serena this far?



The room stayed dim, the lighting cool and subdued.While the audience was caught up in the music, Vivian quietly slipped away from the cameras, heading out to the hall to send messages as "V." She sent a message, saying, "Didn't you say Serena couldn't stand up to Napier? How is she still showing up here?"



Blade Joker replied, "Who knows what she said to him at the villa that night! When we got back home, the old man didn't really address me, but he did say he was done interfering in our affairs."



V's response was quick and sharp. "So what do we do now? I can't let go of what happened at that charity auction!”"


Blade Joker responded, "Charles hasn't completely shut me out yet. I'll see if I can convince my oldest brother to step in."


V asked, "And you honestly think he'll take your side?"


Blade Joker answered, "I'll give it a shot. Out of the three of us, he's always been the sharpest,staying out of my fights with Charles and watching from the sidelines. He isn't stupid. If things change, he'll make the choice that benefits him. Just trust me, I'm with you.I respect how determined you are-when you set your sights on something, you go after it. The way you get there doesn't matter, only that you succeed."



V asked, "What about today? Did you manage to mess up her audio and video?"



Blade Joker reassured her, saying, "Relax. Everything's under control." Vivian read the messages and finally allowed herself to breathe easier.



Her gaze drifted to the camera gear nearby, a wave of emotion rushing over her.


Dealing with Serena had become a constant irritation for her-she nearly lost sight of her original plan.



She still had evidence about Serena's miscarriage, and with the added scandal about the fake donation, it would be easy to bring Serena down.



With that in mind, Vivian stepped out of the hallway and slipped back into the backstage lounge.



She settled onto the sofa, gently dabbing at her eyes while glancing over at the cameras.



The host noticed her and hurried over, trying to offer some comfort.



Vivian shook her head, putting on a brave face. "I'm just really moved by this performance. It brought back so many memories. Serena is truly amazing."



Alex, who sat a little distance away, looked at her in shock. Was Vivian really praising Serena?



The host wanted to ask more, but Vivian simply fell silent, watching the show through her tears.



Behind the scenes, she was plotting to knock Serena down while using her as fuel for more drama.
No matter how impressive Serena seemed, Vivian would always treat her as a stepping stone.


The higher Serena rose, the safer Vivian felt about her own position.


She only had to wait for the right moment to reveal the evidence and ruin Serena's reputation.


Wiping her tears once more, she put on that familiar mix of gentle sadness and fierce ambition.


As Serena ended her song, still hidden behind her mask, Vivian was the very first to start applauding.
###Chapter 62 They Had Once Shared Something Beauti...
On stage, Millie pressed her palm against the piano's polished surface, drawing in a steadying breath that calmed the flutter in her chest.


After allowing herself this moment of quiet preparation,she glided toward center stage,where the band members Alex had carefully selected moved into position beside her, and together they offered a graceful bow to the sea of expectant faces below.



She drank in the sight of the audience, witnessing eyes that sparkled with raw emotion and unspoken anticipation.



Her lips curved into the softest of smiles.



"Thank you," she whispered, her voice carrying neither triumph nor melancholy-just the pure essence of genuine gratitude wrapped in simplicity.


The applause erupted like astorm, rolling through every corner of the vast auditorium in waves of appreciation.



Millie pulled her attention away from the crowd,pivoted with elegant slowness, and made her exit alongside the musicians who had shared this moment with her.
Throughout her entire performance, she sensed Brandon's intense stare burning into her back,yet she steeled herself against the urge to meet his eyes.


They had once shared something beautiful and real.But that precious connection had withered and died,leaving only memories in its wake.



She had never questioned the authenticity of his deep emotions, though she understood with painful clarity how swiftly they could transform into something entirely unrecognizable.



He occupied that seat tonight solely because another woman had captured his heart.


The second live broadcast of Heavenly Melody rolled forward with relentless momentum.



Millie had claimed the fifth performance slot,while several other vocalists remained poised to take their turns.



The production quality soared to exceptional heights,transforming the voting rounds into a fierce battlefield of supremacy.



Millie's live audience votes climbed to impressive heights, but puzzlingly, her online support lingered stubbornly in mediocre territory.



She wasn't drowning in last place, but a noticeable chasm stretched between her in-person admirers and her digital backing.
Consequently,when the crew calculated the weighted scores, her overall ranking settled into respectable territory above average, though it fell short of the coveted top tier.


When Charles pushed through the dressing room door,defeat shadowed his weathered features as he shook his head in disappointment.


He had exhausted every strategy and pulled every string within his reach, yet success continued to slip through his fingers.


Meanwhile, Oakley continued weaving his web of sabotage from the shadows,determined to undermine Millie's chances.



Millie dismissed Charles' worried expression with a gentle wave, communicating that she could weather this storm. She harbored unwavering faith that once he managed to wrestle control of the situation,justice would finally prevail.


For this moment, survival was her only goal-avoiding elimination-and she sensed that victory wouldn't demand much more patience.



In the audience, Alexia practically vibrated with excitement and joy.



Experiencing the performance live surpassed every expectation Alexia had formed from watching grainy phone streams or those frustratingly low-quality clips  that circulated online.



She had always harbored unwavering faith in Millie's extraordinary abilities and knew this moment would vindicate her belief.



During the commercial intermission, she found herself bubbling with enthusiasm, engaging anyone within earshot in animated discussions about the breathtaking performance they had just witnessed.



Suddenly, her attention snagged on something peculiar happening in her peripheral vision. Someone was conducting clandestine recording activities nearby.



Without creating any disturbance or drawing unwanted scrutiny, she maneuvered herself closer to investigate the mysterious person's electronic equipment.


The gadget was unmistakably a recording instrument,despite its compact and discreet design. Her eyes blazed with newfound curiosity and intrigue.



As Alexia deliberated her next course of action, she overheard the person grumbling with bitter frustration,"I hemorrhaged money for these overpriced resale tickets from Taylor, but at least this time I managed to capture my own pristine recording. Let's see what those venomous haters have to say now! Serena truly embodies perfection and transforms every stage she graces into pure magic! Whatever happens, I'm evolving into a devoted, hardcore Serena enthusiast.They forced me into this corner, so the blame doesn't rest on my shoulders. I'm embracing my rebellious nature!"



Upon hearing this passionate declaration, Alexia's excitement soared to new heights.


They were clearly fighting on the same battlefield,united in their cause.



The devoted fan-who operated under the online pseudonym Seville-basked in his sense of accomplishment until he detected subtle movement stirring behind him. When he swiveled around, he nearly launched himself from his seat in startled panic.


Someone was staring directly at his forbidden recording device with penetrating intensity.


Electronic equipment faced strict prohibition within these hallowed walls, and now he had been discovered in flagrant violation of the rules.


"Stay calm, my friend! I'm an ally!" Alexia interjected with urgent reassurance. "Honestly, I share your conviction that those streaming clips fail to capture Serena's true brilliance and do her incredible talent a grave disservice."



Seville's tense muscles began to uncoil slightly,though suspicion still clouded hisjudgment and kept him on edge.



Alexia refused to allow this golden opportunity to slip through her fingers like sand. She surveyed their surroundings with calculated precision and whispered conspiratorially, "Now isn't the appropriate moment for detailed discussion. After the show concludes, let's arrange a private meeting. Trust me-you won't experience a single moment of regret."


Meanwhile, the persistent fan who had attempted to gain entry to inquire about the demo remained trapped outside the venue, his anger reaching a boiling point of frustration.


"I possess a legitimate ticket! How dare you deny me entry? Attempting to bribe me with your pathetic money? Absolutely not-I reject your pathetic payoff,I demand admission! Are you among Vivian's vindictive haters? So what if I admire her talent? Hands off! Let me go this instant!"



This fanatically devoted Vivian supporter found himself once again being firmly escorted away by the vigilant security team.







Across the digital landscape, the second broadcast of Heavenly Melody was dominating social medias with unprecedented momentum.



When the three formidable Crobert business titans made their surprise appearance, it triggered an immediate explosion of online chatter and speculation.



Leaked footage capturing Vivian's moments of laughter and intimate conversation with the Elliott siblings sent the entire Internet spiraling into another  frenzy of discussion and debate.


As each talented performer claimed their moment in the spotlight, their exceptional and standout performances ignited countless	passionate conversations among viewers.



But what truly claimed the crown of trending supremacy were the hashtags #VivianCrying, #VivianTheGracious, and #VivianTheSaint.


Those viral hashtags chronicled Vivian's emotional breakdown following	Serena'sbreathtaking performance and her subsequent gracious compliments about Serena's vocal abilities.



"Wasn't Serena the one who ruthlessly drove up the bidding price for that exquisite tanzanite piece Vivian desperately wanted at the charity gala? Vivian demonstrates such remarkable grace and class. Not only has she never uttered a single disparaging word about Serena in the aftermath, butnow she's publicly celebrating her stunning performance with genuine admiration."



"She truly embodies kindness in its purest form. I could never summon that level of magnanimity within myself."



"I remain completely baffled by Serena's behavior patterns. She consistently projects this icy demeanor toward Vivian-whether during team selection processes or at the glamorous gala, she radiates this aloof indifference, yet honestly her stage presence lacks that special spark."


"Absolutely correct.I cannot comprehend why the live audience votes soar so dramatically high in her favor.Certainly, she possesses talent, but she hardly reaches the pinnacle of excellence everyone claims."



"Perhaps she's simply leveraging powerful connections behind the scenes?"



"Who can say for certain? Isn't Serena currently under contract with the prestigious Evans Entertainment agency?"


As the spirited chatter continued building momentum,everyone's collective attention pivoted once again toward a new spectacle.


"Wait, is that the identical 6-carat ruby pendant adorning Vivian's neck-the same magnificent piece Brandon purchased for an astronomical $28 million at the charity gala?"


"It absolutely is! And Brandon has made another unexpected appearance at the show, despite his well -known aversion to attending events of this nature.He keeps making these remarkable exceptions exclusively for Vivian!"



"He lavishes her with such devoted attention. What an absolutely enchanting love story unfolding before our eyes!"



Once again, #VivianRubyPendant rocketed to the  summit of trending topics across all social media platforms.







Time seemed to dissolve into moments, and soon the intensive recording session reached its natural conclusion.


Millie and Charles began making their way toward the waiting sedan, their footsteps echoing against the pavement.


They had barely crossed the threshold into the cool evening air when someone's voice rang out clearly."Serena!"



Millie pivoted gracefully to discover the three Elliott siblings approaching with warm smiles illuminating their faces.



Jayceon, the most spirited and vivacious of the trio,bounded over with infectious enthusiasm radiating from his every step. "You delivered an absolutely phenomenal performance!"


Adriana followed closely behind and offered an appreciative nod of approval. "I witnessed your presence at the charity gala, but I harbored no conception that your live performance would reach these incredible heights of artistry."


Millie possessed comprehensive knowledge of the Elliott family's reputation and had always held deep  admiration for their strong family values and principles.


Following the charity gala's conclusion, she hadn't requested that Jayceon keep the fact that Millie was the original owner of that tanzanite a secret since she attended the event as Serena-someone who wasn't even supposed to know Millie, yet he had chosen to honor that discretion anyway. He might occasionally present himself as somewhat of a chatterbox, but his loyalty proved absolutely unshakeable.



Millie allowed a genuine smile to bloom across her features and nodded graciously. "Thank you both for extending such generous kindness toward me."



"Would you honor me with your autograph?" Jayceon beamed with boyish excitement. "And might we capture a photograph together-all three of us?Would that arrangement be acceptable to you?"



Millie smiled warmly and positioned herself gracefully for a photo with them, while Myron, maintaining his characteristically quiet demeanor, stood observantly off to the side.



Just before the camera captured their moment,Millie experienced an inexplicable premonition and shifted her gaze toward the side entrance.


At that precise instant, Brandon, who had emerged from the venue accompanied by Vivian, directed his attention toward their gathering as well.
###Chapter 63 Couldn't Stop Her Tears
The sharp click of the shutter echoed as Jayceon snapped the picture.



Only then did Millie realize she hadn't been ready."Oops, I wasn't looking at the camera. Can we try that again?"


A bright grin lit up Jayceon's face. "Absolutely, let's take another one!"


Turning back toward the lens, Millie put on her best smile.


The instant camera whirred,freezing Jayceon,Adriana,and Millie-mask and all-together in one shot.


She watched Jayceon slide the fresh print free and pass it over to her.



Carefully,Millie scrawled Serena's name on the glossy white border.


Task finished, her eyes drifted to the spot Brandon had occupied just a minute earlier.


He was gone now, already swept away by Vivian.


Only emptiness remained where he'd stood. For a moment, Millie lingered; then she turned away,only to lock eyes with Myron by chance.



No words left his lips-he just watched her,and as soon as he noticed her looking, he pivoted and called for his siblings to follow him out.


Saying nothing, Millie simply slipped into the luxury vehicle behind Charles.



The car eased onto the road,and with today's show wrapping up without a hitch, Millie found herself heading back earlier than usual.


Steadily, her health had turned a corner-gone was the constant weakness that once defined her days.



Inside the comfort of the vehicle, she began her routine: wiping away her makeup, slipping off her mask,and changing into casual clothes.


Her mind wandered back to her earlier conversation with the policewoman-her car repairs were finally finished. Mentioning it to Charles, she let him know she'd be getting off partway.


A plan formed: she would pick up her car and make a quick stop at her own place.


After countless nights spent in the hospital, nothing sounded better than her own bed.


No objection came from Charles; he simply let her out near the dealership with a nod.
Millie waited for hiatus car to disappear down the street before she headed inside.


A few signatures later, her keys were returned and her car was hers again.


Settling into the driver's seat, a wave of nostalgia hit her.



It amazed her how only ten days apart felt like a lifetime away from the familiar feel of the steering wheel.


With a small exhale, she brushed off the odd sense of distance, started the ignition, and merged into the rhythm of city traffic.


By this time, dusk had deepened to night, and rush hour painted the streets with constant movement.


Streetlights flickered to life, headlights stretched out in lines ahead, and the city hummed with the restless energy of the evening crowd.


From the radio, a mournful love song played, its melody occasionally drowned out by announcements about gridlocked roads ahead.



After so many nights spent in a sterile hospital room,Millie felt strangely out of place among the city's relentless energy and noise.



The familiar world seemed distant, almost as if she'd been gone for much longer than she had.
Traffic on the overpass moved in steady streams.Millie shook off her sense of disconnect and kept her attention firmly on the drive.


Not far away, beneath that same overpass, a sleek Bentley inched along in bumper-to-bumper congestion.



Brandon occupied the rear seat, his gaze lost in the cityscape flashing past the glass.


Next to him, Vivian was completely absorbed in her phone,tapping out message after message.


Another glance at the endless line of cars outside kept Brandon distracted.


Years might have passed, but the city's chaos and crowds had not changed at all.


In a moment of silence, the memory of a masked woman taking a picture with the Elliott siblings replayed in his mind.


Despite knowing she was supposed to be Charles 'girlfriend, thoughts of her lingered far longer than they should have.


Something about her just kept reminding him so much of Millie.



A red light halted the Bentley's slow progress.


Perhaps that brief stop was all it took to pull Millie's name back to the surface of Brandon's mind.


The memory of that endless twelve-hour ferry ride from Eldoria drifted through his mind.


After what felt like forever, they reached the shore at last, friends waiting to greet them with open arms.


No harrowing twists, no real danger-just the two of them, the night, and the quiet certainty in her gaze when she looked up at him: warm, trusting, filled with nothing but faith in him.



Now,sitting in the back of the Bentley, Brandon felt a tightness in his chest, as if the air itself was pressing in on him.



Lowering the window brought a rush of city air, but it did nothing to loosen the ache.


A heavy, lingering sorrow made it hard to breathe.


From a nearby car, the plaintive notes of a song floated over. "I listen to the whispers of a cloudy day.Standing in the dimness, I long to tell the sky-whatever happens, may there be joy, even under these cloudy days..."


Traffic had come to a halt at the light, and for a moment,the world stilled with the music.



Brandon's mind once again wandered back to that distant dock, the sky heavy with clouds, just like tonight. After the snowfall, the sea's chill shimmered with an austere beauty. Millie's hand had been locked in his,gripping with fierce determination.


Those memories tugged at Brandon, refusingto let go.



Vivian's voice broke through his reverie. "Everyone online keeps saying how gorgeous this pendant you got me is."



Reality snapped back into focus as Brandon glanced at the sparkling jewel hanging from Vivian's neck.


"It suits you," he said quietly.


A wide smile lit up Vivian's face. "I think so,too."



His gaze dropped, lips drawn into a firm line.



The truth weighed on him-Vivian's time was running short. Fewer than six months remained.


That knowledge gnawed at himn. The blame for her suffering fell directly on his own shoulders.


The divorce with Millie was already in motion.



Until those final months had passed, nothing else could take priority.



Recently, Millie had become noticeably more accommodating. She might have still been upset,but at least there were no more outbursts. That, at least,made things easier.
With the end of the song from the next car and the light shifting to green, the Bentley rolled on, turning away from the memory-laden streets.


High above the city streets, Millie steered her car along the overpass, heading in the opposite direction from Brandon.



Their paths split, each bound for a separate corner of the sprawling city.



Soon,Millie rolled into her apartment complex's lot.



She parked, switched off the ignition, and reached for her purse in the passenger seat, pausing just long enough to peek into the glove compartment, half-expecting it to be empty.



Instead, her fingers brushed against a forgotten bag.


A furrow creased her brow as she drew it out.


Opening the small paper bag, her movements slowed -her hands hovering for a moment over its contents.


There it was: a bottle of medication, one the therapist had prescribed.


In those days, she was still carrying her child.


The true weight of what she was losing hadn't sunk in then. She'd agreed to end the pregnancy, planning to take the medicine afterward.
But after the tragic loss-everything unraveled. The hospital stay, the car repairs, and the prescription abandoned in the glove box all tangled into one long aftermath.



After a long hesitation, Millie finally took out the medicine.



She tried to open the bottle, but her hands refused to cooperate, trembling too much to manage even the simplest task.


Tears splashed onto the label, grief and regret crashing over her in an unstoppable tide.


Ten days had passed since her child was lost. The moment she woke in the hospital and learned her baby was gone, she shut everything out and sank into numbness, untouched by either happiness or grief.


Only now, sitting with the medication in her hands,did the fog begin to lift-a jolt of pain dragging her back into the reality she'd been avoiding.


Hot tears splattered across the bottle, staining the label with silent anguish.


Not once, until this moment, had she wept. And now,she simply couldn't stop her tears.


A heavy,aching sadness took hold, filling every hollow part of her.
###Chapter 64  I Will Walk Away
Once Vivian was safely dropped at her door, Brandon drifted through the city on his own.



Every glimpse of neon and the restless swirl of strangers outside sparked a tangled ache inside him.



Through the window, he watched the pale glow of streetlights and the endless flow of cars, feeling strangely apart from all the city's noise and movement.


A sudden vibration in his pocket then interrupted his thoughts.



Glancing at the screen, Brandon spotted an incoming call from an old friend-Darden Harris.



He answered with a simple, "Yeah?"


On the other end, Darden didn't waste time. "Feel like grabbing a drink? I'm at Blue Lounge. Unless you've got plans with Vivian?"


Their friendship went all the way back to childhood, so Brandon gave a quick nod to his driver and told him to switch directions.



"I'll be there," he said.


The Bentley glided through Crobert's busy streets, making its way to Blue Lounge, the city's most popular night spot.


Navigating through the bustling crowd, Brandon eventually arrived at Darden's private suite.



A subtle frown crept across his face as he stepped inside.


The place buzzed with laughter and voices, a lively mix of men and women-Darden clearly intent on throwing a party.


"Brandon, you made it!" Darden called out, pulling him into a boisterous hug.



With a hint of reluctance, Brandon allowed himself to be led further in.



Raising his glass for attention, Darden declared,"Everyone, meet my oldest friend Brandon Watson-he's the one who runs the Watson Group now! Let's hear it for him!"



His tipsiness was obvious, and the crowd responded with eager applause.


Brandon's face was a familiar one in Crobert;recognition flashed instantly in the eyes of half the room.



The noise grated on him, so he quietly motioned for the hangers-on to clear out.


Rather than take offense, Darden just grinned and waved for everyone but the two of them to file out.


Once the room had emptied, the two sat on the sofa,Darden pouring a generous drink for his friend.



Brandon studied the liquid glinting in the low light before taking a measured sip.


"How's life been treating you?" Darden asked,settling in.



Instead of answering right away, Brandon let his head rest against the back of the sofa, his featuresslipping into shadow where Darden couldn't read them.



Instead of responding directly, Brandon broke the silence with his own question. "What about you?Anything new?"



Darden let out a sharp laugh, swiping at his eyes before draining another mouthful of liquor."Oh,you know-family drama on repeat. There's always some issue cropping up. And would you believe it, Alyssa just dumped me. Said I'm 'damaged goods' now and wants nothing to do with me."


He sighed in exasperation. "Honestly, I don't get her logic. Sure, I've been around other females, but it's always business. Dad needed me to show the McCoy family's daughter around town; was I supposed to say no?"



Brandon traced circles in his glass, only half-engaged in Darden's tale.
Eventually, he suggested, "Maybe you're sending mixed signals without realizing it."


Darden rolled his eyes and topped off Brandon's glass,refusing to let the subject drop.


"Alright, I hear you, Mr. CEO," he teased. "Guess I should take notes-stick with one woman at a time like you did. First Millie, and now Vivian. Loyal as ever."


The jab struck a nerve. Brandon's annoyance showed as he motioned for Darden to put the bottle down.



That only seemed to amuse Darden more.



"You're upset?" Darden grinned, settling back with a look of mischief.



"Don't take it the wrong way. Honestly, I admire you.I wish I could say the same for myself," he added,setting his glass aside and slumping into the couch."You've done more than rescue your family's business -you've actually made it stronger. And on the personal side, Millie would have gone through hell for you. Now you're with Vivian, and, at least from what l heard,she seems genuinely good. Meanwhile, me..."


With shadows flickering across his features, Darden's expression stayed hidden from view.


"I may have inherited the company, but there's always another crisis knocking at the door. Alyssa and I have been together forever, yet now she can't even stand to look at  me-and nothing I say seems to matter.
Sometimes I wish I had your kind of freedom."


His voice lingered in the quiet,echoing faintly.


Brandon's gaze dropped, tracing the slow orbit of melting ice in his glass.


Freedom? Was that really what his life looked like?


Nothing could be further from the truth.



"So, tell me-what's the deal with you, Millie, and Vivian?" Darden changed course, curiosity sharp in his tone. "I've seen some posts online, but it's impossible to keep track of your story."


"We're going through a divorce, Millie and I," Brandon replied.



"You're kidding me!" The answer jolted Darden upright,the light finally revealing his stunned face.


"For Vivian? Are you serious?" Darden blurted out,his disbelief unmistakable.



Brandon raised his glass, taking a slow sip.



A simple "Yes," was his answer.



Darden shook his head, setting his own drama aside for the moment. "I don't get it. You and Millie always seemed rock solid-looked happy, even. And Vivian...isn't she terminally ill? I figured you were just being kind to her, nothing more. Plus,is Millie really fine with this?" 
Brandon kept his eyes on the slow swirl of ice, not bothering to meet Darden's gaze.


"She gave her consent," Brandon replied.


"No way," Darden said, springing to his feet and pacing the length of the room.



Genuine confusion clouded his face.



"Are you telling me she's just letting you go? I remember how she handled that PR disaster with that pretty executive from the vendor company-remember? You ignored the woman, but she kept trying to get close, even showed off in front of Millie.Next thing I knew, Millie made sure that woman knew her place. She was so angry with you after,she wouldn't even talk to you for days," Darden continued,lost in the memory.



The recollection came back to Brandon vividly.



It was all a misunderstanding-he'd never shown interest in the woman, but his silence had been misread,and she ended up provoking Millie.


He could still see Millie's expression as she hurled the folder at the woman, telling her in no uncertain terms that anyone who didn't put business first had no place working with Watson Group.



That same evening, when Brandon reached for her, most she shoved him away with a fierce glare, stubbornness radiating from every inch of her.


It took what felt like forever before her anger finally began to fade.



Only once she'd cooled did she lay things out for him."Brandon, I'm willing to compromise on business, but never on love."



She was even clearer before the night ended. "I love you,Brandon-more than anything. But I can't share your heart. If someone else ever takes my place in your heart..." The determination in her eyes was unmistakable when she added, "I'll walk away,no matter what."



Brandon's fingers tightened around the glass, knuckles white, before he forced himself to loosen his grip.



"You know, she was always glued to you-never more than a little sulk when she got upset. It doesn't add up.I don't see how she could actually let go," Darden murmured.



A wave of heaviness washed over Brandon as he closed his eyes, the past pressing in.


Seven years had passed, and yet she'd never managed to walk away.



Lately, she'd even started handling things with care, choosing not to stir up unnecessary conflict.



That thought sent Brandon reaching for his glass,draining it in one swallow.



The drinks kept coming that evening, but a subtle,persistent unease settled in the back of his mind.



Still, when morning came, Brandon brushed off the discomfort and dove back into his daily routine.



Everything slipped into a comfortable rhythm, until a news report shattered the calm-


"Millie spotted escorting a child to school,child addresses her as 'mom.'"
###Chapter 65 Who's The Child
Across the Internet, the news report exploded in popularity.


On this occasion, media outlets took care to shield the child's identity-every image and detail about the minor was blurred beyond recognition. The only photograph to surface showed Millie from a distance,her hand clasped with a small child wearing a backpack.


Maybe that extra caution came from a desire to avoid crossing Brandon.



Even so, the story sent shockwaves through online communities.



"Wait, when did Millie become a mother?"



"Yeah, hasn't it only been a year since her wedding to Brandon? How could there be a child? Did they have the child before getting married? No one ever said anything about her giving birth though."



"One report says the kid is already old enough for school,but isn't Millie only twenty-five herself?"


"Is this another one of Millie's ploys? Now that Brandon and Vivian are spending more time together,she stirs the pot wvith a stunt like this!"



"I'm convinced-maybe she even engineered the viral story on purpose!"



"This is just too much. Can't she wait six more months?Vivian's only been given half a year left to live!"







The gossip raged on everywhere,and meanwhile,at Vivian Floral Design, Vivian's fury boiled over as she slammed her glass down with a sharp crack.



Without a word, the cleaning crew swept away every shard of glass and slipped out of the room.


Vivian reached for her phone, dialing with steady fingers. "Tell me the truth. How did she suddenly turn up with a child?"


The reply was muffled but urgent, "We're in the dark for now. We'll have to look into it. The whole thing feels off. If she's been hiding a child for years,Brandon would surely have known. Are you thinking of questioning him?"


"Is that what you're suggesting?" Vivian's eyes glinted,sharp as glass. "You believe this story isn't real?"



"There's a good chance it isn't," the voice answered, not missing a beat. "Talk to Brandon. No matter what you find out, there are ways to manage the fallout."


A few seconds ticked by before the voice quietly said,"Vivian, whatever happens, I've got your back."


Vivian exhaled, letting some of the tension slip from her shoulders. She pressed the button to end the call.


She started to pace, thoughts racing as she considered every possible outcome.



Maybe Millie truly did have a child, though that hardly made sense. Brandon had always wanted kids. They got married last year, so there would have been no reason to hide a child if one existed.



Of course,it could be that the child had nothing to do with Millie at all.



But what would she gain from all this?



The answer snapped into place, and Vivian broke into a sudden laugh.


Clearly, Millie had come to terms with the fact that Vivian's reputation could not be overshadowed,so she decided to hatch this new plan.



A wave of amusement flickered across Vivian's eyes as the idea settled in her mind. "Never thought you'd be so naive, Millie," Vivian muttered under her breath. She then scanned her contacts for Brandon's number and tapped the screen to call.



Meanwhile, inside the Watson Group's executive office, Eugene approached Brandon's desk and offered a tablet. "Mr. Watson, here's the newest update. I've followed your instructions and had a reporter dig for extra details."



Brandon scrolled through the screen, taking in a mix of online rumors and exclusive information passed along by the reporter.



"The little girl in question looks to be around four or five," said Eugene, picking up the thread. "She was photographed alongside Mrs. Watson at the entrance of a kindergarten. I made sure everything was wiped from the web, just as you wanted. People may still be talking online, but there will be no more details."


Even in this digital age, celebrity spotters lurked everywhere, eager to sell any tidbit for the right price.


Clearly, this was one of those moments.


A photograph on the screen caught Millie kneeling down to tidy the little girl's clothes, just as the child called out, "Mommy," in a gentle voice. This image was unfiltered and raw, the source of all the recent rumors.



A faint crease formed between Brandon's brows as he wondered about Millie's intentions.


The appearance of a little girl puzzled him-when did she come into the picture?



He reached for his phone, planning to speak to Millie,but a sudden vibration stopped him.



Vivian's name flashed on the screen.



He took a brief moment to consider, and then accepted her call.


"Brandon, did you happen to read the news online today?" Vivian's question drifted through,her tone soft and uncertain, tugging at his empathy.



Brandon wasted no time getting to the point."You mean the situation involving Millie?"



"That's right," Vivian answered, her words faltering as she continued. "Brandon, is that little girl yours and Millie's?"



Brandon's mind sifted through memories. For seven years, Millie had always been near. If a child had ever existed, he could not have missed it. He let out a short breath. "I honestly don't know, but I doubt it."



Vivian's next words sounded gentle and slightly muttered, "Brandon, please don't worry about me. If you and Millie did have a child, I'd understand. After everything you've shared, it's not unusual. I... I really wouldn't mind."



She faded into silence, and an uneasy quiet settled between them.



Silence lingered for half a minute before Vivian quietly murmured,"Forget it."


With his gaze drifting to the sky outside his office window, Brandon watched the slow parade of clouds."I'll get to the bottom of this."


No reply came from Vivian, not even a faint echo of her usual encouragement.



A tremor in her voiceslipped through the line as she admitted,"Brandon, I have no wish to cause her pain.My time is running short, and there isn't much left that I desire. All I ever wanted was your love. If this situation brings her sorrow, Brandon, please return to her side. I'll be all right."


Tears tightened her words, but she managed to hold herself together. Back at her studio, however, Vivian's face was bright with cheer,masking everything inside.


Releasing someone could sometimes carry more weight than clinging to them.


It did not take long for Brandon's reply to break the silence.



"You can trust me to deal with this," said Brandon."Take care of yourself, Vivian."






At that very moment, Millie sat in front of her own screen, studying every headline that had appeared.


Once she felt certain that every trace of the news had vanished online, Millie finally set her phone aside.


The sight of a crayon sketch nearby drew a gentle smile to her lips.


Just days earlier, discovering the bottle of pills in the car and thinking of her lost child had triggered another mental breakdown.



She set aside everything and went to Rita's office.



Emotions surged,leaving her unsteady as she walked inside. "You're not yourself right now," said Rita, watching her closely. "I've seen some things online, but I never imagined you'd have to endure the loss of a child,too."


Inside her office, sympathy softened Rita's expression.



Seated across from her doctor, Millie looked drained,her eyes vacant assilent tears slid down her cheeks.


"What am I supposed to do?" she whispered. "I just feel so empty, and it hurts. Dr. Carpenter, is there a pill for this sadness?"



A sigh slipped from Rita's lips.


Over just a few days, the decline in Millie's health had become obvious.



"Recovery takes time," Rita replied. "I'll give you something to help you calm down for now. How does that sound?"



An acute episode had gripped Millie, and if things spiraled further, electroconvulsive therapy might become necessary-she would need a family member with her for that.


From what Rita remembered, Millie's only options were her mother or her husband, Brandon.
###Chapter 66 Back To Watson Mansion
Both her mother and her husband had wounded Millie's heart beyond repair.



Rita understood that if Millie could still manage her affairs independently, she would never want them to discover her vulnerability.



As Millie's deteriorating condition advanced with each passing day, Rita recognized the harsh reality that while temporary caregivers could provide momentary relief, contacting Millie's family would become unavoidable.



That particular day marked another grueling session of their medical treatment regimen.



The exclusive private facility maintained the strictest confidentiality protocols, and thanks to Millie's deliberate efforts to conceal her struggles, not a single soul had learned about her condition so far.



Upon her release, Rita gently urged Millie to maintain her medication schedule religiously, never miss her regular medical appointments, and offered warm reassurance while suggesting she embrace some well -deserved rest and recuperation.
Millie absorbed these instructions with minimal response, her voice barely rising above a whisper as she retreated to the solitude of her newly rented apartment.


Her body had begun mending from the devastating miscarriage and the physical trauma of her recent fall,while Crobert Hospital efficiently processed her discharge documentation. Alexia had taken complete control of every administrative detail, lifting that burden from Millie's shoulders.


For endless stretches of time, she existed in a strange limbo, uncertain of her next steps or even her current purpose in this fractured world.


Eventually, Charles became the person who managed to locate her through her maze of isolation.







Within the bustling practice halls of Evans Entertainment, Millie threw herself into preparations for the demanding third live show of Heavenly Melody.


Her phone buzzed against the table, and when she glanced down, Brandon's name flashed across the screen.



Technically speaking, they remained caught in the legal web of divorce proceedings, still bound by marriage papers, creating an obligation for her to discuss certain significant matters with him.


However,the countdown had already begun, and very soon, she and Brandon would become complete strangers to each other, their connection severed permanently.


After weighing her options carefully, Millie chose to let the call fade into digitalsilence.


Meanwhile, at the Watson Group's imposing headquarters, Brandon sat rigid in his executive office,listening to the cold, mechanical busy tone echoing through his phone speaker, while his lips formed a tight,frustrated line.


Without a moment's hesitation, he snatched his car keys from the desk and stormed toward the exit with determined strides.



Just as he stepped beyond the threshold,fragments of a hushed conversation drifted to his ears-



"Did you catch that explosive news circulating online?The photographs showing Mrs. Watson escorting that mysterious child to the school entrance?"


"Absolutely, I've examined every single image! It's become such monumental news throughout the entire city!"
"What's your take on the whole situation? Do you believe that child belongs to both Mr. Watson and Mrs.Watson?"


"I honestly have no idea whatsoever. Haven't you noticed Eugene racing around the building like a madman all day long? I'm certain he's scrambling to manage this crisis."


"What do you think drives Mrs. Watson's actions in this scenario? Is she attempting to solidify her position as Mr. Watson's legitimate spouse? Or does she harbor some alternative agenda?"


"I'm completely clueless about her intentions, but by allowing the child to make this public appearance at such a critical moment, only a few realistic possibilities exist-she's either staking her claim to status or positioning herself to claim ownership and inheritance rights."



"I hadn't even considered that angle! Your analysis makes perfect sense now!"


"Absolutely! Haven't you witnessed those dramatic television storylines? At the most crucial moment, an illegitimate child suddenly emerges from the shadows to stake their claim on the family fortune. Now that Mr. Watson spends every waking moment beside Vivian, it makes complete sense that Mrs. Watson would want to execute one final,desperate maneuver."
A sharp voice suddenly pierced through their whispered conspiracy as someone spotted Brandon's imposing figure striding through the corridor. "Mr.Watson!"



The remaining employees quickly ceased their animated discussion and bowed respectfully in synchronized motion.



Brandon's cold gaze swept across their guilty faces with practiced indifference before he stepped into the waiting elevator, his mind churning with darker thoughts.



What diabolical scheme was Millie orchestrating behind his back?



Had this become her latest calculated maneuver?



He had genuinely believed she had finally developed some rational sensibility, but now it appeared she had merely refined her tactics and changed her destructive approach.


She was still wreaking havoc on his carefully constructed world!



The haunting memory of Vivian's heart-wrenching sobs echoed relentlessly through his consciousness,amplifying his anger and confusion.
Brandon settled into the driver's seat, his initial impulse driving him to locate Millie immediately and demand answers to his burning questions, but uncertainty paralyzed him.



Where could he possibly locate her now?


Their paths hadn't crossed since that brief,uncomfortable encounter within the sterile hospital corridors.



He had attempted to visit her during her recovery,only to catch sight of her shadowy silhouette leaning against Giffard's supportive frame through the frosted glass door, their forms creating an intimate tableau.


Did she still remain confined within those sterile hospital walls?



With these questions swirling through his mind,Brandon ignited the engine and steered his vehicle toward Crobert Hospital's familiar entrance.



After days of avoidance and uncertainty,he finally returned to that place again.



His inquiries at the reception desk yielded unexpected results-Millie had already completed her discharge procedures days earlier.


The nurse he questioned regarded him with barely concealed bewilderment, her voice carrying a note of incredulous disbelief. "You honestly don't know when your own wife received her discharge papers and left this facility?"


Brandon's jaw clenched tightly as his lips formed a hard line, and he departed without offering a single word of explanation.



Back within the confines of his car, he dialed Millie's number once again with growing desperation.


No answer came through the electronic silence.


His next attempt reached Alexia's line instead.



She answered on the second ring, her voice carrying an unmistakable edge of irritation.



"What could you possibly want from me now?"Alexia's words dripped with barely restrained contempt.



"I need to know Millie's current location," Brandon stated,his tone clipped and businesslike.



Alexia responded with sharp, cutting sarcasm, "You seriously possess no knowledge of your own wife's whereabouts and you're calling me for answers?That's absoutely ridiculous and pathetic!"



Brandon's brow furrowed with mounting annoyance at her deflection.


"Alexia, I'm approaching thissituation with complete seriousness. What's the real story behind her connection with that mysterious child?"



Alexia possessed complete knowledge of the intricate situation unfolding around them but chose not to reveal a single word of truth.



"Why don't you approach her directly? What's the point of dragging me into this?" Alexia's voice sharpened with accumulated resentment. "Previously,when I reached out to you, didn't you accuse me of stirring up problems on Millie's behalf? Well, I'm terrified I'll speak out of turn and you'll later claim that Millie and I conspired together to deceive you.l refuse to shoulder the blame for your groundless accusations and paranoid suspicions ever again."


With those final, cutting words, Alexia severed the connection abruptly.


Brandon stared at his phone, listening to the hollow buzz of the dial tone while a fierce, unnamed fury clawed its way up from his chest.


His fist collided with the steering wheel, and the Bentley responded with an indignant blast of its horn that echoed through the parking garage.


Millie was becoming increasingly bold and reckless with each passing day.


Previously,her rebellious acts had consisted of minor mischief and petty schemes, but this time she had actually dragged an innocent child into their complicated web of marital discord!


She understood exactly how desperately he craved fatherhood, how the mere thought of children could unraveI his carefully constructed defenses.


During countless intimate moments they had shared,he would trace gentle circles across her flat stomach,his voice barely above a whisper as he pleaded with her to bear his child, but those conversations always ended in disappointment.



Brandon drew in a shuddering breath, forcing his racing pulse to settle before dialing Millie's number once more.


The phone rang endlessly into the void, each unanswered tone stoking the flames of his mounting rage.



Perhaps for the first time in his privileged existence,he experienced such consuming, uncontrollable anger coursing through his veins.


His phone buzzed against his palm, and Brandon's lips curved into a cold sneer,certain that Millie had finally decided to face him.
Instead, his grandfather's name flashed across the screen,wiping the smugness from his expression.


His brow creased with mild concern as he reluctantly answered the summons.



"Grandpa," he said, his voice carefully controlled.



"Return home tonight without delay!" Derek's words crackled with unbridled fury through the speaker."Brandon, don't foolishly assume that just because you currently control the Watson Group's operations,you possess unlimited freedom to act however you please. I still draw breath in this world!"



Brandon's fingers massaged his throbbing temples as he surrendered to the inevitable summons, his tone shifting to one of practiced diplomacy. "Grandpa,please don't allow yourself to become so agitated.Such emotional turmoil proves detrimental to your health."



"Now you suddenly express concern for my health?!"Derek released a bitter, contemptuous snort before abruptly ending their conversation.







On the opposite side of the city, Millie stared down at her phone's illuminated display as it announced an incoming call.
Derek's name flashed insistently across the screen.



After wrestling with uncertainty for several long moments,she finally pressed the answer button.



However, once the connection established itself, she remained frozen in silence, unable to force words past her constricted throat.



Derek also maintained his quiet stance on the other end. After approximately three tension-filled seconds passed, a long, weary sigh escaped from his aged lungs and traveled through the speaker.


"Millie, would you come visit me tonight?" Derek's voice had transformed into something gentle and coaxing. "Even if you harbor deep resentment toward Brandon,you could still find time to see this old man."



Millie's fingers tightened around her phone until her knuckles turned white, her internal struggle finally resolving as she nodded into the empty air.



"Alright," she whispered, her voice barely adible."I'll be there."



Indeed, she recognized the necessity of returning to the Watson Mansion.



Numerous unresolved issues demanded her attention and required final closure.
Time seemed to accelerate around her, and darkness gradually descended upon the city.



After maneuvering her vehicle into the familiar parking space, Millie stepped onto the pavement with legs that felt unsteady beneath her weight.


Following many days of absence, she found herself standing once again before the imposing gates of the Watson Mansion, her past and present colliding in the gathering twilight.

###Chapter 67 He Had Hoped And Tried
The Watson Mansion stood proudly on the northern outskirts of Crobert, in a neighborhood known for its exclusivity and charm.


This particular stretch of land was owned entirely by the Watson family, with no other property in sight-quiet,private,untouched.



At the heart of the estate lay a stunning lake shaped like a full moon, the centerpiece of the mansion grounds.



Locals often called it the Moonlit Estate, a poetic name that suited the way the water shimmered under the night sky and how the house wrapped gracefully around it.



Painted a soft, pale yellow, the mansion took on a dreamy glow after sunset. When the lights were on, it looked like a moon glowing gently on Earth,peaceful and perfect.



Nestled beside the lake, the mansion was a picture of quiet beauty.



Millie brought her car to a slow stop at the entrance,
her eyes steady as they took in the familiar scene.



On any other day, she would have driven straight through the gates without a second thought. But today was different. Today, she came as a guest.


The security guard, recognizing her at once, quickly stepped out of the booth and came to greet her.


"Mrs. Watson! It's so good to see you," he said,already pressing the button to open the large wrought -iron gates. "Mr. and Mrs. Watson have been hoping you'd visit."



Millie gave a soft nod. "I won't be driving in today.Please arrange for the estate buggy."



"What? Um-yes, of course!" he replied, surprised for a second but quick to respond. "I'll have it sent right away."



Moments later, a small buggy arrived, humming softly as it stopped in front of her.



Matthew Douglas,the estate's butler, stepped out and greeted her warmly. "Welcome back,Mrs. Watson," he said,opening the door with practiced grace.



Millie gave a slight nod and stepped in, saying nothing.



As the vehicle began to move, Millie officially entered the gates of Moonlit Estate.
"Mrs. Norma Watson's been asking about you a lot lately," Matthew said, glancing at Millie briefly as he drove. "She says the house feels too quiet without you, and she's still not quite used to that."


"And Mr. Derek Watson-he's been absolutely angry with Mr. Brandon Watson," Matthew continued,chatting away. "He mentioned how Vivian doesn't hold a candle to you. Said he regrets not stepping in sooner. That he wants to speak up for you now."



Millie listened in silence, half-convinced that Derek and Norma had put Matthew up to saying all this.


The night wind picked up, cool and persistent,prompting her to pull her coat tighter around her shoulders.



The buggy rolled along the edge of Moon Lake,offering a sweeping view of its calm expanse. A gentle breeze stirred the surface, sending ripples across the water that shimmered beneath the silver glow of the moon.



At the center of the lake, a stone bridge stretched toward the mansion, its reflection wavering in the moonlit water. Just then, a Bentley crossed it,heading straight to the estate.



Millie recognized it instantly-Brandon's car So,he was here too.


The wind stirred her freshly cut hair, sending a few strands across her face. She reached into her coat pocket, pulled out a simple hair tie, and began gathering her hair into a neat twist.


After a quiet moment, her voice broke the stillness."Has anything happened at the mansion lately?"



Matthew took a moment to think before speaking."Mr. Derek Watson's health hasn't been the best lately,and Mrs. Norma Watson seems a bit down. Mr.Brandon Watson has dropped by a few times, but they almost always end up arguing. His parents are still abroad, and a few folks have dropped by to check on the old couple, but nothing major's happened."



Millie gave a small nod.



So far,it sounded like things had been relatively calm.



But then her gaze drifted ahead, to the Bentley parked near the entrance. A man stood beside it.


Brandon.



No,tonight wouldn't be peaceful after all.


The buggy came to a stop at its designated spot. Millie stepped down, adjusting the strap of her bag as she steadied herself.



Just as her heels touched the stone path,a tall shadow stretched across the ground beside her.



She didn't need to look up. She already knew who it was.



"Mr. Watson." Matthew greeted him politely.



Brandon gave a small wave, silently motioning for him to leave.


Millie said nothing. Neither did Brandon. They stood quietly, the silence stretching between them.



Under the soft glow of the moon, two people who once shared everything now felt like strangers standing on opposite shores.



Brandon's gaze lingered on Millie.



Her hair was swept up now, no longer cascading down as he remembered. The scent around her was unfamiliar-something fresh, elegant, not the comforting fragrance he once associated with her.Even her shoes were different, sharp, graceful heels that clicked with quiet confidence, replacing the simpler pairs she used to wear.



He frowned slightly. It was already late April, yet she was still wearing a thin coat.
She had changed. In more ways than one.



After a long pause, he finally broke the silence. "Are you cold?" He reached out, his fingers brushing her arm gently, as if unsure whether he still had the right to.



Before his fingers could find rest on her arm, she moved back ever so slightly. His touch brushed against the fabric of her sleeve, and then fell away,leaving behind an odd hollowness.



His brows knitted tighter.


Her clothes felt too loose, too light.



Had she lost weight?



He studied her more closely-her already delicate face now sharper, almost fragile. The weight loss made her look heartbreakingly frail. His jaw tightened.


Millie said nothing in response to his question. Instead,she straightened her posture and spoke with soft restraint,reclaiming control of the moment. "What do you want,Brandon?"



It took him a second to remember why he had waited there.



He took a deliberate step forward, his voice low but edged with accusation. "That little girl with you... the one making headlines. They say she calls you her mother. When did you give birth to a child?"



As he spoke, his gaze dropped instinctively to her abdomen, searching for some trace of the past.


"It has nothing to do with you," she replied coolly,offering no explanation.



A surge of irritation flickered in his eyes. "Millie," he said, his voice steely, "we are still married-on paper at least. And now I find out you've been raising a child I've never heard about? You expect me to stay silent?"



Millie turned her face away,refusing to meet his eyes.



"Where did she come from?" he asked again, his voice more forceful now. "We've... shared so much.Countless nights, countless chances. But there was never a child. And suddenly-"


"Stop." Her voice cut through his like a blade.



Brandon opened his mouth to speak again, but froze when he saw the glint of moisture in her eyes.



Millie inhaled shakily and then said,"You know better than anyone why I never became a mother all these years."



Brandon's jaw clenched, a wave of old memories crashing behind his quiet eyes. He hadn't forgotten. No matter how many years had passed, that one tragedy still lived inside him like a wound that never quite closed.


There had once been a child.



They had been younger then-reckless, hungry for each other, swept up in a whirlwind of passion that left little room for caution.



His desire for her had been insatiable, and though they'd shared countless nights together, he'd failed to notice the subtle changes in her body.She had always been fragile, her health a delicate balance; her monthly cycles were often irregular, so neither of them had suspected anything.



Then came the trip to Flesta. Brandon had been away on business, immersed in negotiations that turned more dangerous than he'd anticipated. The opposing party had orchestrated a twisted challenge, one that demanded risk and recklessness. And without flinching,she had leapt into the frigid water, proving her courage, unaware of the life growing inside her.



By the time he pulled her out, her body was trembling,soaked to the bone, her lips blue, and blood seeping into the freezing current. The doctors had saved her just in time. But the child... their child... was gone.



He still saw her face as she lay in his arms,pale and broken. Her gaze had locked onto the man who had set the trap.



"You gave me your word," she whispered.


The man had only nodded in response.


Brandon never forgot that night. It was late autumn,and the first frost had already settled over the earth.The air was sharp, the trees bare, and his world fell apart with hers that night. She had cried in his arms,her sorrow spilling like rain, blaming herself with every breath.



Afterward,her body never fully healed. No matter how many nights they spent wrapped in each other-how deep their affection or intense their desire-conceiving again became a silent, unspoken battle.


Over the years, Brandon had hoped. He had tried.Sometimes out of love, sometimes to ease his own guilt, and sometimes out of a quiet desperation to make things right.


But what Brandon would never know... was that after they married, she had conceived again. And then she lost that child,too.
###Chapter 68 My Life Isn't Your Business
Millie held back the weight in her chest.


Seven years. So much had happened, and so much had changed.



She had made her choices then. And now, she was making new ones-ones that didn't look back.



She and Brandon had truly loved each other once.That part was real. And no matter how things ended,she didn't regret it. But the love they shared had ended. She had nothing left to give him-no more time, no more pieces of her body or heart.


Without another word, Millie turned,ready to walk into the mansion.But Brandon reached for her hand.



"Millie," he said again.



His voice came softer now. "You were never replaceable. Vivian only has six months left. When it's over, everything can go back to how it was. You don't need to keep making things difficult. Everything will boe fine in six months."



His words made her stop and laugh, quietly, bitterly.
So this was what he thought? That she was being difficult? That she was stirring up trouble-for a man or a title she no longer wanted?



He still didn't understand.



She never chased the Watson name. She never needed the position of his wife. She was Millie Bennett, the daughter of a legacy that mattered long before he entered her life.



Once,she stayed by his side out of love for him. Now,she was Millie Bennett again, and she stood here alone out of love for herself.



She had given him chances, more than she should have. Each time, she'd looked for clarity, for a reason to stay.



And each time, his words cut deeper than the last.She had had enough.



The boy who once shielded her in that rainy night years ago had never grown up with her.



He belonged to the past. The Brandon standing here,with eyes full of someone else, was a stranger. She no longer wanted this version of Brandon. He wasn't the boy etched in her memory.



"Let go," she said sharply. But he didn't. His grip on her wrist stayed firm.


"Millie," he said, "what is it that you want?"



She wanted to take back her father's legacy. She wanted answers about his death. She wanted to rise again in her own name, protect the people she cared about, and leave Brandon behind.



The words hovered in her throat,heavy and real. But she didn't say them.



They were still in the middle of a divorce. She needed it to go through cleanly. Angering Brandon now would only slow things down.



So instead, she said, cool and even, "Brandon,my life isn't your business."



That did it. He snapped.



The night breeze swept between them,carrying the scent of her perfume. It made her feel like someone he no longer knew.



"Not my business?" he said, his voice rough. "You're still my wife. You think none of this matters to me?"



Millie gave a dry laugh. "So you do remember I'm your wife now?"



"Let go," she said again, trying to pull her hand free.
Their voices rose, sharp and fast, echoing across the quiet night. Until another voice spoke. "Enough!"



Derek's voice, firm and clear, rang from the direction of the villa.



He was as displeased as ever.



"Brandon! What do you think you're doing?" Derek barked.



Brandon's jaw clenched. Still, he didn't look away from Millie.



"Brandon!" Derek snapped again.



Finally, Brandon shifted his gaze, his eyes hard but lowered.



"Grandpa," he muttered. But his hand still hadn't let go.


Derek's eyes were cold, aimed straight at Brandon.Beside him,Norma reached for Millie's hand with quiet worry. "Oh, my dear," she murmured. "You've lost so much weight."



"All because of this fool!" Derek snapped. He raised his walking stick, the veins on his hand visible with rage.



Brandon didn't move. He stood rooted to the spot,the wind from the lake brushing past them, carrying a whisper of cold.


Millie pulled her coat tighter around her.



Brandon noticed. His brows drew together slightly.



Was she cold?



Something stirred in him-a feeling that something had changed in ways he hadn't yet figured out.


"I could hear you two from inside!" Derek roared,swinging the stick at Brandon.



"Brandon, after all the nonsense you've pulled, you still have the nerve to fight with Millie? Sometimes I wonder how someone like you could come from my own blood. His voice grew more angry. "If your parents weren't off gallivanting abroad, if | wvasn't stuck in this state, I'd show you what real consequences look like!"



A year ago, his health had been in decline. Millie and Brandon's wedding had brought him a bit of joy,something to cling to. But now,he looked worse than ever.



"And now all you do is ignore your wife and chase after another woman, dragging our family name through the mud! Have you forgotten the vows you made on your knees when you brought Millie into this house? Don't you feel a shred of guilt?" Derek's words dissolved into violent coughing.



"Grandpa!" Millie and Brandon both stepped forward,but Derek waved Brandon off.



Millie reached for the old man, rubbing his back gently to make him better.



She could still feel the warmth of those who had treated her with genuine kindness.



She might have closed the door on Brandon, but she couldn't turn her back on Derek.



Derek's coughs worsened, and Brandon immediately called for the family doctor.



Inside the villa, the family doctor rushed in and did what he could to calm Derek's breathing.



After checking his vitals, the doctor said, "Mr.Watson's been in a much better shape over the past year. As long as he avoids stress like this, he'll be fine.So please don't push him again."



Once Derek had been helped back into bed, Norma led them out into the hallway. Her face was tight with disapproval.



"Brandon," she said, "how long do you plan to keep this up with Vivian?"
Brandon didn't answer.His head was bowed.



Norma was clearly disappointed.



"You're no longer a little boy," she said quietly with a sigh. "And yes, you've made Watson Group stronger than ever. People say you've outpaced even the Evans and Elliott families. Clearly, you know what you're doing in business."



She let that hang in the air for a moment before adding, "But with all that wisdom, can't you spare a little thought for your wife? Millie stood by you. You were the one who brought her to us. You promised her a home. Do you not care about the mess you've made of her reputation? Do you not care how she feels?"



Still,Brandon said nothing.



His silence only deepened the lines of disappointment on Norma's face. "I was going to eat with you both,"she said. "But now, I'll leave you to it."



She gave Millie's hand a squeeze and cast one last disappointed look at Brandon.



Derek had shouted, even struck Brandon. But still, they were all out of ways to make him come to his senses.



"You should both stay," she added after a breath.
"Your grandfather still wants to talk to you later."



Then she turned to Brandon alone, her tone hard."You'll spend the night here tonight. Do you hear me?"
###Chapter 69 The Person Who Beat Him
Norma slipped away to check on Derek, leaving the young couple to their own devices.



Side by side, Millie and Brandon made their way to the dining hall.


Millie's purpose tonight was clear-she needed to set the record straight with Derek about the child.



Given her status as Brandon's wife, both by law and by title, the sudden appearance of a child demanded an honest explanation.



Still, she hadn't managed to say a word to him yet.


Derek was in no shape to listen just now, so she kept silent, biding her time.



There would be another chance, maybe once Derek was feeling better and sought them out for answers.



Their buggy rolled quietly toward the dining area.



Though Millie and Brandon shared a ride, an invisible barrier stretched between them.
An air of stillness settled over the space, broken only by the moon's gentle glow as it shimmered across the lake.



Moonlit Estate boasted a collection of grand villas,each one reserved for a Watson family member.


Derek's residence stood at the heart of it all. Family meals usually took place in private quarters, but for special occasions of family gatherings or hosting guests, everyone converged at the famed floating restaurant over the Moon Lake.



Tonight was one such occasion-the entire family gathered above the water.



News of Brandon and Millie's return, combined with the online whispers about a mystery child, had piqued everyone's curiosity.



If Brandon truly had an heir, no one could predict what new twists would ripple through the Watson family business.



Once the buggy rolled to a gentle stop, Brandon stepped down first and extended his hand in Millie's direction.



Ignoring his gesture, Millie slid out of the seat on her own,brushing past him without a second glance.
A quick nod from the butler signaled the all-clear,and Millie trailed Brandon into a striking, three-story structure defined by clean lines and modern glass.



Inside, the main floor gleamed under bright lights.Platters of food, champagne flutes, and delicate pastries lined the tables. At the heart of the room, a sunken pool sparkled with floating blooms while a harpist's music floated through the air, wrapping the scene in elegance.



The moment they walked in, a hush fell as curious eyes turned in their direction.



"Brandon!" From across the room, a lively woman in a butter-yellow dress bounced over, barely past 25,with energy to spare.



Offering Millie a quick nod, she flashed Brandon a grin."It's been ages, Brandon!"



A pair ofdimples deepened her smile, lending her a playful charm.



Babette Watson-Brandon's young cousin-had only just returned after years at an lvy League university overseas.



"Good to see you again, Babette," Brandon replied,keeping his tone light.
A server appeared, balancing a tray of drinks with practiced ease.



Millie reached for a champagne flute, nodded at Babette, and then moved to blend into the background, intent on finding a quiet spot to eat while waiting for Derek.



Before she could make it very far,Babette called out,halting her in her tracks, "Millie, wait up! There's something I've been dying to ask you."



The situation struck Millie as strange. Babette, who'd always kept her distance and acted superior before jetting off to Flesta, was now suddenly eager to chat?The change made no sense.



Millie paused, and then asked, "What is it, Babette?"


A sly glance at Brandon, then Babette's expression turned almost conspiratorial. "I heard something interesting back at Flesta. For years, a powerhouse there held an iron grip on advanced tech-a barrier nobody else could crack. Then, out of nowhere,the Watson Group managed to shatter it, changing the entire industry landscape. Now, our firm and that conglomerate split the market between them, at home and overseas. Everyone says Brandon traveled to Flesta himself to close the deal. But..."



Admiration danced in Babette's eyes as she looked at Brandon, but the glance she gave Millie carried something different-something sharper, more curious.



"Here's what really made waves," Babette continued,stepping closer. "The wildest story wasn't about the business deal itself. Rumor had it that Egbert Perez,the infamous head of that conglomerate, had a reputation for trickery-walking away from contracts,toying his business partners. But with the Watson Group, it was different. Supposedly, the only reason he honored the contract was because he lost a bet.And the person who beat him? According to what I heard, that was you, Millie."



Brandon's brow knit in concern, and in a protective move, he positioned himself between Millie and Babette.



"That's enough, Babette," Brandon said, his voice sharp and unyielding



A carefree laugh tumbled from Babette's lips. "Relax,Brandon, we're just chatting," she teased. "You wouldn't believe how often people cornered me about this story back in Flesta. Now that I finally get to meet Millie, I have to hear her side of it."



Her focus shifted to Millie, her smile sly. "So, Millie,what's your take? Everyone knows Watson Group cracked the code first and only then approached Mr.
 Perez. Why does the rumor mill spin such wild tales?Are my classmates simply gullible?"



She chuckled and added with a playful tilt of her head,"Perez might be good-looking, but he's got the reputation of a shark. When he first hit the scene in Flesta, people said he was absolutely ruthless. How could he be tamed by something as trivial as losing a simple bet? There's even talk that losing to you changed him-that he went from a notorious troublemaker to the surprise contender who beat out his competition and took over the conglomerate."



As she spoke, her words sounded light, almost airy,but her gaze was trained on Millie, studying her lowered eyes.



Their little circle was clearly attracting attention by now and someone else joined them, approaching with quiet confidence. "Alright, Babette. You said it yourself it's just idle gossip. Why dwell on it? Am I right,Brandon?”



Derek's family tree had grown sprawling branches-three sons, two daughters. Brandon's father held the spot of second son, while Babette's father was the third.



Casimir Watson, the youngest of Derek's eldest son's children, was the one speaking right now.
A bright grin accompanied his raised champagne glass."Brandon, Millie," he said, pausing to join the gathering.



He sounded as if he was stepping up for Millie, but beneath his polite tone, every word felt like a carefully disguised barb.



Taking his side would be the same as admitting Millie had taken credit for the Watson family's achievements.



"Hey, I'm talking to Brandon, not you. Stay back,alright?" Babette shot Casimir a withering look.



There was no love lost between Babette and Casimir;they'd clashed since childhood, even as she stayed on good terms with Brandon. Millie, however, had always rubbed her the wrong way.



A deep dislike simmered beneath the surface whenever she thought about women clinging to Brandon for support. Still, if Brandon favored Millie,Babette saw no point in open hostility. At most, she'd keep her distance.



Even now, standing in front of her cousin, Babette kept things civil-a mark of Watson pride.



Stories like these had chased her through both undergrad and grad school in Flesta, a constant hum of rumor and speculation. She'd never paid much attention until one particular incident made it personal.


Now, the feeling lingered: resentment that Millie had snatched away some of the family's acclaim.



"Oh,come on,Brandon! Let Millie answer for herself."A teasing smile curved Babette's lips.



Shifting her attention back to Millie, Babette continued, "Millie,have you heard the latest? Word is,Mr.Perez is making his trip to Crobert."
###Chapter 70 What Makes This Wine Stand Out
Babette paused on purpose, her gaze searching Millie's face. "Millie, even with all this talk swirling around,do you plan on seeing him again?"


Brandon cut in, his brow tightening, "That's enough,Babette. Let's leave it at that. I know the truth-Millie has no connection to that man."



A look of annoyance flashed across Babette's features. "Brandon!"


Nearby,Casimir-recently scolded-remained silent,watching the exchange with a faint,knowing smile.


The Watson family had grown massive over the years,with dozens of new faces in every branch.



Tonight, the turnout was impressive.


With Brandon and Millie always in the spotlight,their presence naturally drew a crowd. As they lingered near the entrance, more and more family members drifted over.



Most of the newcomers were cousins and younger relatives-some close, some from more distant branches.



The elders, meanwhile, had retreated upstairs, sipping their drinks and making small talk as if none of this concerned them.



But Millie wasn't fooled.



The air was thick with hidden agendas-today's family gathering was anything but casual.



All the whispers, pointed questions from Babette, and Casimir's subtle digs? The older generation had orchestrated it all, allowing-and perhaps even encouraging-this quiet interrogation, thanks to the child she'd suddenly been photographed wvith.



"Brandon."



"Millie."



"Good evening, Brandon. Good evening, Millie!"


A group of cousins drifted over, smiles and greetings mingling as they arrived.



A few of them had spouses in tow, their numbers swelling the crowd.



With new faces gathering, Millie decided it was time to clear the air. "Honestly, there's no real mystery," she said. "Like Babette said, Watson Group broke new ground first-that was the real victory. Mr. Perez had resources and connections we needed to move forward,and our deal with him was about lifting a blockade, nothing more. As for the so-called wager..."Millie's voice softened as she glanced down. "There was a bet, but it was just a bit of fun on Mr. Perez's part. It didn't influence the partnership in any meaningful way."



Brandon studied Millie, his gaze lingering.


Memories of Flesta flickered through his mind. In those ten short minutes he'd been called away, he never found out what passed between Millie and Egbert.


He only left to sign the deal. When he returned,all he saw was Millie plunging into icy cold water.


The shock of cold blue,the blood, and the child they lost left a scar that never faded.



Not once, in all the years since, had they dared speak of that night again.



The last thing he ever wanted was to watch her break down in tears like that again.



"That's all there is?" Babette asked, still looking for holes in the story.


"That's everything," Brandon answered before Millie could, his voice firm. "You're wrong about her,Babette. She isn't the person you're making her out to be."



Without another word, he took MMillie's hand and led her away from the crowd.



Babette remained rooted to the spot, fists balled in frustration.



Casimir swirled his wine, a smirk curling at the corner of his mouth.



"Feeling left out?" Casimir's tone was light but needling. "You always got along best with Brandon.But now, you put him in the middle and wound up pushed aside. Tough break, huh?"



Babette shot him a glare, retorting, "WVhy don't you stay out of it for once?"



As Brandon and Millie slipped away, Millie couldn't help but replay Babette's pointed words in her mind.



One question echoed above the rest-Babette's casual remark-"Millie, have you heard the latest?Word is, Mr. Perez is making his trip to Crobert."



Her brow creased with unease, fingers tightening around the stem of her glass.



With Derek's message that he wouldn't be joining them for dinner, the entire family soon found themselves seated along a sprawling dining table, the evening carrying on.


As always, Millie took her seat right beside Brandon.


Around them, the dinner table buzzed with chatter,silverware chiming and glasses raised in constant toasts.



Halfway through the meal, one of the elders steered the conversation toward the child.



Millie braced herself, half expecting Brandon to join in and question her, but to her surprise, he skillfully sidestepped the subject.


He gave nothing away except, "We'll address that issue for everyone in detail another time."



With Brandon setting the tone, nobody dared press further,limiting themselves to a few indirect, cautious hints.



Stealing a glance at Brandon,Millie watched him serve her more food, his expression steady and composed.



A quiet realization dawned on her.



Despite Brandon's command over the Watson family,conflicts bubbled beneath the surface-alliances shifting, loyalties uncertain. Tonight, as their marriage still appeared intact to the public, he chose to protect her-he had to.



He had done the same earlier, both when Babette brought up the past and just now, when an elder pried about the child.



By the time they entered the dining hall, they'd both left their coats at the door.



Brandon's gaze lingered on her, noting the loose sleeves and pants. Even in clothing that concealed her frame, her recent weight loss was impossible to hide.



She shivered more often these days.



Brandon looked at her and murmured, "Have some more."



Dinner seemed to slip by in no time at all.


Casimir tried digging for information here and there but came up empty every time.



The rest of the family had no better luck.



A sudden vibration interrupted the flow-Brandon checked his phone and saw Derek's name flashing across the screen.



He stood and stepped aside to take the call,leaving Millie at the table.



Babette seized the moment, drifting over to Millie once more.



She plucked a glass of white wine from a passing tray and offered it with a sly tilt of her head.


"What,is the wine not up to your standards?" Babette teased.



Saying nothing,Millie accepted the glass, brought it to her nose, and inhaled the bouquet. The aroma confirmed it-a high-quality vintage.



She let a small sip linger on her tongue and savored the taste.



Babette watched, and then said, "Have another taste.I picked this up in Flesta-it wasn't easy to get, and it definitely wasn't cheap."


With a glint in her eye, she added, "It's also...rather special."



That comment drew Millie's gaze upward, eyes narrowing slightly in curiosity.



Babette only grinned. "Relax. There's nothing in it but wine," she said, a quick laugh escaping her. "Brandon's nearby-I wouldn't dare try anything foolish." Fixing her gaze on Millie, Babette murmured, "I'm only curious if you can pick out what makes this wine stand out."



A puzzled look crossed Millie's face as she took another careful sip.



Despite her efforts, nothing beyond the wine's obvious excellence stood out to her palate.



"I'm sorry, but I can't tell." A quiet apology escaped her lips.



Babette let out a light, almost mischievous laugh.



"So you really haven't a clue," Babette teased.



Confusion swept over Millie. Babette's attitude tonight made no sense, and neither did her cryptic comments.



"If there's something I should know, just tell me,"Millie replied quietly.



Babette only offered a mysterious shake of her head.



Instead, she gestured again, inviting Millie to try the wine once more.



Having already finished one glass, Millie waved off the offer. "I should stop-still need to see Derek later tonight."
"Alright." Babette simply nodded her acceptance.



A pleasant smile lingered as she added, "I'll be throwing a wine tasting soon to celebrate my return.You and Brandon should make an appearance."



That invitation lingered in Millie's mind. Despite the ongoing divorce proceedings, she recognized the importance of showing up in public with Brandon before the divorce was finalized.



Just then, Brandon returned, slipping his phone away



Without a word, he went to get Millie's coat and wrapped it gently around her shoulders. He offered Babette a brief nod, and then led Millie away from the gathering



The night air rolling off the lake cut straight through them,sharp and chilly.



A shudder passed through Millie as the cold found her.



With the wine swirling in her head and the breeze pressing against her, dizziness crept in.



Brandon's low voice broke through her haze "Grandma just called-Grandpa's already asleep, so we won't see him tonight. She wants us to stay and visit in the morning."
Millie could only nod, her mind a fog. Her footing faltered, and she nearly stumbed.



Brandon caught her quickly, his arm steadying her before she could fall.
###Chapter 71 A Hard Slap
Brandon's body radiated warmth as his strong arms wrapped firmly around Millie's waist.


For a moment, Millie stood frozen, arms stiff at her sides. Then, gathering herself, she slowly placed a trembling hand on his chest and gently but firmly pushed him away.


A faint spell of lightheadedness washed over her,though it had nothing to do with intoxication.



They boarded the buggy in silence, heading toward Brandon's place in the estate.



The journey unfolded in silence, a quiet tension stretching between them. Not a single word passed until the vehicle rolled to a halt near a cluster of trees.



"Mr. and Mrs. Watson," Matthew began respectfully,"Mrs. Norma Watson told me to remind you that Mr.Derek Watson expects to see you both first thing in the morning. So, you'll need to spend the night here at the estate." He paused, observing the emotional distance between them with a quiet sigh. "Truthfully,they've both been deeply concerned for a while now.Asking you to stay is just a pretense. What they really want... is for you to open up to each other."
He brushed at the corners of his eyes, visibly emotional. "I still remember when you first brought her home, sir. The way you looked at each other-it was like something out of a storybook. So much love back then. I just... I don't understand how it got tothis point."



He cleared his throat and blinked quickly, brushing away the shimmer in his eyes. "Please... talk. Maybe that's all it'll take to set things right."



With a heavy breath, Matthew stepped back and disappeared into the night.



Above them, the night had fully unfurled, stars cloaked behind drifting clouds.



Golden lights lit the path ahead, winding softly through the trees toward a certain villa.



Brandon took the first step, heading into the grove without a word. But Millie didn't follow.



Sensing her stillness, he stopped and looked back over his shoulder. "What's wrong?" he asked.


"I'll head back for now," Millie said quietly,her tone even. "I'll come by in the morning."



She turned to leave, but before she could take another step, Brandon reached out and caught her wrist.



"Millie," he said, his voice steady but low. "It's been days since we last saw each other. Don't you think it's time we talked?"



Talk? Was there truly anything left to say?



A few steps away, the silver light of the moon spilled across the surface of the lake, turning the ripples into sheets of soft glass.



Brandon's voice cut through the silence again, this time firmer. "At the very least... about the child.I deserve an explanation." His grip remained firm. "You never gave me answers. And I can't face them-my grandparents-without knowing the truth."



Millie turned her face away, her gaze drifting into the darkness.



After her session with Rita,she drifted along aimlessly,unsure of what to do next.



Sometime later, Charles mentioned that the charity event's funds were finally being allocated and asked if she'd like to see where the resources were directed.



Curious about how the money from the tanzanite sale was utilized,she accepted.



That was how she found herself standing in frontof a welfare center in Crobert. She had purchased a painting at the auction-Ari's painting-without knowing it would lead her here.


Maybe it was fate. Or maybe... the child she lost had found another way to stay close.



Tanzanite. A donation. A painting bought on impulse.All of it had woven a path that led her to Ari.


The young girl had been left at the shelter long ago,discarded by her biological parents due to a chronic illness.



For a number of reasons, her condition had gone untreated for years. The fundraising event turned out to be a turning point.



After only a handful of encounters, Millie felt something deeper, like it had been meant to happen.So she made a decision.



She would adopt Ari. She would make sure she received the medical care she deserved, give her a proper education, and walk beside her through every stage of life.



But there was one problem-Millie wasn't thirty yet,the legal minimum age to adopt. So,she reached out to the only person who could help, her mother.



That afternoon, she found herself standing outside her mother's small business, watching silently from across the street. After several long moments, she took a breath and called out for the first time in ages,"Mom."



Millie's mother agreed to help with the adoption paperwork. Though the legal process would take time,it had already begun.



Officially, Ari would be registered as Millie's younger sister-but everyone involved knew the truth.



Millie was the one who longed to be Ari's mother. And Ari understood that, too.



When Ari expressed her wish to attend school, Millie found a small private preschool in Crobert, one that respected children's privacy and emotional needs.



Maybe it was the early abandonment or the years spent in a quiet welfare center. Or maybe it was just her age. Whatever the reason, Ari often seemed unsure,like she was still learning how to move through the world.



That morning at the preschool entrance,Ari froze.


Millie knelt beside her, gently pulling down her mask to reveal a soft, reassuring smile. "What is it?" she asked kindly. "Are you scared?"



Ari gave a hesitant nod, but then quickly shook her head.Conflicted.



Millie didn't rush her. She simply waited, calm and steady.


After a long silence, Ari looked up, her small voice barely a whisper."Mom..."


Then she immediately dropped her gaze, as if unsure she had the right.


"Do I have to call you that?" she asked, almost too quietly to hear.



Millie reached out and gently smoothed Ari's hair."Only if it feels right," she said softly. "If it's too soon,you can call me Miss Bennett, or just Millie."


Ari blinked, visibly relieved. She nodded quickly, her lips curving into a shy smile. "Miss Bennett," she said in a quiet voice, wrapping her arms around Millie for a quick embrace before dashing inside.


Millie stood still for a moment, watching as Ari reached the classroom door. The little girl turned around, gave a small wave, and then disappeared inside.



That fleeting second-Millie without her face covering -was all it took for the cameras to capture her.Despite all her efforts to remain unnoticed,someone had managed to snap the photo.
The guardianship paperwork was still in progress,which meant Millie was allowed to accompany Ari to school, but couldn't yet bring her home.


But it was only a matter of time now. On average, the paperwork was processed within thirty business days.



With that thought in mind, Millie turned to speak. "She has no ties with the Watson family. So don't worry.She won't be there to fight for your family's inheritance or property."



She slipped her hand out of Brandon's grasp. A soft wind stirred the air, and the faint warmth of the alcohol she had earlier consumed returned, making her feel lightheaded.



Without a word, she stepped out of her heels and stood barefoot on the grass, her back to him. "That's all there is to say," she continued calmly. "You've heard enough. I'll tell your grandparents the same thing tomorrow. And if you doubt anything I've said,go and check for yourself. I have no reason to lie,Brandon."



She took a deep breath, straightened her shoulders,and walked away.



"Millie!" Brandon called after her, his voice tense with emotion. "Does it really have to end like this?"
She didn't pause. She had already made her choice.



"We had a child once," Brandon called out again."You let her call you 'Mom'... so what about me? What am I supposed to be?"



The words echoed through the quiet grove, his voice carrying a weight it hadn't held before. The trees around them seemed to hold their breath.


"Or maybe this was your plan all along," he added,suspicion creeping into his voice.



In Brandon's mind, she had done all this on purpose.She had allowed the child to call her Mom where cameras might see it, ensuring that they would end up face-to-face again at the Watson estate.



Millie froze mid-step, her breath catching.



Something stirred deep in her chest-a tangled mix of emotions she couldn't name at first.


Was it anger clawing its way up, or sorrow pressing down on her heart? Maybe it was both, crashing into each other all at once.



"I never asked you this before... Back in Flesta, during those ten minutes I stepped away-what did you really say to him?" Brandon spoke. "We lost our child. Do you think I haven't suffered? I've carried that pain with
me every day since. You know exactly why I've longed to become a parent all these years. So why would you twist something so sacred-why would you use a child as part of some scheme?"



His voice came in a low, even voice. calm as still water But each word cut like glass, merciless and cold.



Her chest ached with the weight of his words.Her hands trembled, her breath caught somewhere between a sob and a scream.



How could he say something so cruel? How could someone who once held her heart speak with such emptiness?



She slowly turned to face him. He stood in the moonlight, his expression unreadable.


Perhaps it was the distance between them-or perhaps the years-but in that moment, he didn't look like the man she once loved. He wore Brandon's face,but something inside him felt hollow... twisted.


Was this really him? Or had something changed so completely that he now looked like a stranger wearing his skin?



Without thinking, Millie crossed the space between them. Her steps were swift, her heart pounding. And then-
Her hand struck him hard across the face. The sharp sound echoed into the silence.



Her palm stung, but the pain didn't matter. He had already hurt her far worse.
###Chapter 72 Kisses
Brandon's cheek burned where the slap had landed, a mix of rage and humiliation simmering beneath his skin.



Not once in nearly three decades had anyone ever dared treat him with such disrespect.



Heat flushed through him as he spun to face her.



Words hovered on his tongue, but the sight of Millie's tear-streaked face stopped him cold.


Bathed in silver moonlight, she looked as if she might vanish at any moment-so pale, yet her eyes were raw and swollen with grief.



Her tears spilled quietly, steady as rainfall, soaking his resolve.



Every drop cut deeper than words ever could.



Memories from Flesta flooded his mind-the night they lost their baby, the way she had sobbed into his chest, every cry shattering him anew.



Not a single sound escaped her lips, yet the ache in his chest was sharp and unbearable.
He felt helpless against the heaviness settling in his heart; witnessing her like that was almost too much to endure.



Reaching out, Brandon tried to brush away her tears,only to have his hand knocked aside.


"Brandon." Her fingers shook as she looked him in the eye,voice unsteady but firm. "I refuse to be seen as someone so despicable."



Tears streamed down her cheeks, and she balled her fists so tightly her knuckles blanched, refusing to let herself look small.



"You told me Vivian was dying-half a year left,you said-and you wanted to care for her. Fine. You told me you needed a divorce for her sake, and I followed you all the way to the courthouse. Whatever you had with her, I let it go. But how could you belittle me?How could you show such contempt for me and my child?" Millie's voice barely rose above a whisper, but every syllable rang out beneath the hush of the night."Brandon, pain isn't reserved for you and Vivian alone.I made the mistake of loving you, and I will walk away.But what gives you the right to wound me-and my child--like this?"



Her mouth trembled, her voice faltering on those last words. Nails pressed deep into her skin,trying to anchor her composure.



Determined not to break, she drew her lips into a stubborn, unyielding line.



"Millie." Brandon's brow creased with anguish, every sentence landing like a blow. "About Vivian..."



He struggled for words, but in the end, nothing came out.



Pale moonlight streamed over everything, cloaking the earth in a cold shimmer.



"Half a year." The words escaped him at last, heavy and slow. "That's all the time she's been given."



A hollow laugh slipped from Millie's lips.



She tilted her chin, searching the black sky instead of his eyes.


How did everything unravel like this? Why was he the source of so much pain?



Dragging her sleeve across her face, Millie brushed away the last tears, unwilling to say more, and turned to walk away.



His hand shot out, catching hers before she could escape. "Millie." Her name left his mouth-hoarse,unwilling to let go.



No reply came. She only twisted her arm, determined to free herself.



But he only gripped her tighter.



Beneath the moon's gaze, the red in his eyes matched the stubbornness in his hold.



Millie fought his grasp, desperate to be anywhere but here.



The night breeze cut through her, and suddenly the world began to spin again.



That wine...



Years spent by Brandon's side at countless functions had made Millie an expert-one sip, and she could judge a drink's strength without fail.


Limits were never a mystery to her, and tonight's glass shouldn't have been enough to faze her.



Long experience with overseas business taught her to stay alert for tampering, and this drink held no hints of anything suspicious.Babette had no motive for such games either.



So why As the world tilted around her, she caught sight of Brandon's fingers circling her delicate wrist.



Her health had never truly recovered since that brutal fall on the stairs-since the baby was lost.



Now, the evening breeze tangled with the alcohol in her veins, leaving her reeling, legs barely able to hold her upright.



All she wanted was to get away from this place.



She tried to push Brandon off, to free herself from his grasp.



But she hadn't realized how much her balance had slipped.



"Millie?" Brandon's brow furrowed in concern.



No answer came from her.



Without hesitation, he bent and swept her up into his arms.



The ground vanished beneath Millie as Brandon lifted her, and she tried to shove him away,but her strength had long since faded.



"You've had too much to drink." His voice rumbled low,the sound barely breaking through his chest.
"Let me down," Millie muttered, her words slurred with fatigue and wine.



Brandon paid no attention, scooping up her shoes and carrying her toward the villa without missing a step.



Branches whispered overhead as they crossed the shadowy path, and Millie's head spun. She watched moonbeams break through leaves, scattering silver patterns over Brandon's shoulders.



For a moment, the glow blurred past and present,memories blending with the present moment in Millie's mind.



She had to admit-she was more intoxicated than she thought.



At the door, Brandon pressed his thumb to the scanner. The lock clicked open, and he set her gently at the threshold.



She leaned against the wall, steadying herself, while Brandon swung the door shut behind them.



Tears still streaked her cheeks, and something in her expression left a heaviness in his chest.



Lifting her, he'd noticed just how much weight she'd lost.
She'd always been slight, but now her fragility seemed impossible to ignore.



"Looks like the wine's caught up with you. Were you really planning to leave in this state?" Brandon's voice was gentle but edged with concern.



Heading out like this could put her in real danger.



"I don't need your concern," Millie retorted, her words thick and nasal from crying.



A quiet sigh escaped Brandon, frustration mingling with resignation.



"Moonlit Estate isn't exactly teeming with taxis. How do you plan on getting home-on foot?" he asked,trying to reason with her.



Security meant the area around the estate was always clear of prying eyes, and the Watsons liked it that way.



Normally, a family driver would be on standby, but Millie seemed intent on making her own way out.


Watching her clamp her lips together in stubborn silence, he continued, "I spotted your car outside.Were you thinking of getting behind the wheel like this? Millie, you can't even keep your balance."



She refused to answer, tears streaming unchecked down her face.



"Enough," Brandon said softly, "don't cry anymore."



The faint glow by the doorway cast shadows over Millie's tears, each one pulling at Brandon's chest.


She turned away, refusing to meet his eyes.



With a weary sigh, he bent down, hands gentle as he cradled her face and wiped the wetness from her cheeks.



Up close, he caught every shimmering drop clinging to her lashes.



He closed the distance and pressed his lips softly to hers.



Salt from her tears mixed with the warmth of her mouth.



Her fists landed against him, feeble and unconvincing.



Ignoring her resistance, Brandon tightened his grip,lifting her easily and carrying her through the hall into the bedroom.



White wine lingered on her skin; he didn't give her a chance to speak, silencing her with another kiss.



He didn't want words-only the closeness between them.



Inside the softly lit room, desire wove around them as he pinned her to the sheets, one hand roaming over every familiar curve.



He adored the feel of her, treasured every night spent tangled together, sweet whispers filling the darkness.



Nothing compared to the way she trembled in his arms or the look in her eyes when she focused only on him.



Weight had melted off her frame, leaving her even more fragile than before.



His hand traced her waist, startled by how much smaller it felt beneath his touch.



A whisper slipped from his lips as he drew her close."Millie..." He pressed a kiss against her mouth.



"Millie." Again, her name lingered in the hush between them as he found her lips, breath mingling softly wvith hers.
###Chapter 73 Brandon, It Makes Me Sick
Brandon's lips trailed lower, lingering at the small mole just above Millie's heart.



Her voice broke through the haze.



"Don't," she whispered.



He pretended not to hear.



"Will you really force me?" Millie's hands pressed against his head, her tone pleading and defiant.


He hesitated, desire warring with restraint, but his arms refused to let her go.



"Our loss in Flesta was a tragedy,Millie," he murmured,heat and longing sharpening his words. "We could try again...we could have another child."



A bitter laugh, soaked in heartbreak, escaped her. "If that's what you want, go to Vivian instead. Isn't she the one you spend every waking moment with these days? Haven't you already slept with her?"



Her voice broke, trembling with grief. "Brandon, don't do this to me. It makes me sick."
Sobs wracked her, each breath shaking her small frame with fresh waves of pain.



The words hovered on Brandon's lips-he wanted to tell her nothing had ever happened with Vivian,that she was wrong about all of it.


But Millie's mind was made up, and anything he said now would only sound like excuses.



Defeated, he let the silence grow.



Brows knitted in frustration, he finally pulled himself upright,unwilling to add to her misery.


His eyes lingered on her, rumpled and broken on the sheets.



Heat still pulsed beneath his skin, but with effort,he drew his hands away, forcing himself toturn from her.



A muscle worked in his jaw as he pressed his eyes shut,wrestling his own desire into submission.


Pale moonlight spilled across the floor, illuminating every quiet detail in the room.



He listened as her sobs slowly faded, powerless to comfort either her or himself.



A movement caught his attention-Millie straightened,gathering herself.
She quickly buttoned up her shirt, swiped the tears from her cheeks, and pulled her pants into place.Several buttons had vanished-torn away by his impatience, now nowhere to be found.



"I'll get you a new shirt," Brandon said quietly, his gaze settling on her.


Her lips were flushed and swollen, still bearing traces of where his mouth had lingered.


Desire, only moments ago pushed aside, now threatened to break loose again.



Fingers curled into tight fists as he fought for control.



Refusing to look at him, she slid off the bed,eyes fixed on the floor.



He saw her intent clear as day-she was determined to leave.


"Do you really have to go?" Brandon asked, voice tight, working to keep his temper in check.



Without a word, Millie rose, though her legs were unsteady beneath her.



Irritated, Brandon reached for her, pulling her back down to the mattress.



"Grandma expects us to remain here tonight," he said, his tone edged with warning.



Millie's reply came out cold. "I have no intention of staying. Try to force me,Brandon, and you'll only earn my hatred."



Frustration churned inside him, his jaw tight and his body tense with restraint.



She started to rise once more,and Brandon was ready to snap, but the sudden buzz of his phone cut him off.



Vivian's name flashed across the screen.



A faint crease appeared on Brandon's brow. He paused,debating, but finally accepted the call.


Vivian's voice came through, strained and uncertain."Brandon, I heard you went back to Moonlit Estate tonight-with Millie.Is that true?"



"Yes," he answered, voice flat.



With news of his return spreading through the family,it was no wonder Vivian had somehow caught wind of it.



"Are you with her right now?" Vivian asked, her words trembling, barely holding back tears. "Are you...spending the night there together?"



Brandon found himself without a ready answer.
They were meant to share the night under the same roof. But Millie had refused.


That was a detail Vivian didn't need to hear.


His silence stretched between them, and Vivian's quiet sniffles gave way to soft sobbing.


He still said nothing, lost for words and unwilling to offer empty reassurances.


After a spell, Vivian's sobs turned into a harsh cough."Ahem... ahem..."


He could hear her struggling for breath, her voice cracking through the phone. "Brandon, I feel awful...lt hurts so much tonight..."



Mid-conversation, Brandon's phone buzzed again. He glanced down to see a message from Vivian-a photo flashed on the screen.



Her face was streaked with tears, lips wiped raw, and a faint line of blood lingered at the corner of her mouth.



The image told the rest-her coughing had left its mark.



Vivian's voice trembled through the line. "Brandon,please...could you come over? I'm in so much pain
right now."


A deep frown furrowed Brandon's brow, his eyes shutting for a moment.



He gave in,replying quietly, "Alright."



Millie stood nearby, having seen and heard everything.Brandon made no effort to hide the call.



Vivian's plea hung between them-Millie knew exactly what it meant.



"Aren't you going to her?" Millie's voice was flat. "It's obvious you want to."



He shot her a look,lips drawn tight and eyes hard.


A thousand explanations crowded his mind-he wanted to say it was only because Vivian was sick.



But the coldness in Millie's gaze stopped him, and every word withered before it could reach his lips.



He rose from the bed. Once dressed in fresh clothes,he grabbed his keys from the dresser. Without making a sound, he slipped out of the room.



At the entryway, his gaze lingered on the closed door to the bedroom. He looked away and left the villa without another word.
...


Millie waited untiI she heard Brandon leave before she let out a deep sigh.


Scrambling to her feet, she locked the door in a hurry.She even dragged a table against it for extra security,and then sank to the floor, drained.



Brandon's presence still clung to her as she clutched at her collar.



Everything he said made sense. There was no way she could make it home tonight, not with her head spinning from too much wine.



Their marriage still stood on paper, with memories of nights spent together and heartbreak from the babies they lost before birth, but Vivian was his world now.
A heavy wave of emotion drove him out of the house,chasing after Vivian, while Millie knew what would happen next.
Even as she understood, her heart wanted none of it.
She had let him go a long time ago.
Brandon settled behind the wheel of his car. As he buckled in, he spotted Matthew, the butler, hurrying
toward him.



"Mr.Watson, where are you headed?" Matthew called,worry in his voice. "Your grandmother gave strict orders that both you and Mrs. Watson stay at the estate tonight."



Brandon hesitated for a moment before rolling the window down.



In the glow from the porch lights, the lines on Matthew's face seemed even deeper.



"There's something I need to take care of tonight,"said Brandon, voice steady. "I'll make sure I'm here for breakfast with Grandpa and Grandma."



Worry flickered in Matthew's eyes as he continued,"Sir, this isn't only about sharing a meal. Your grandparents hopes you and Mrs. Watson can mend things while you're here."



The thought of reconciliation hung in the air.



A memory of Millie's tear-stained face flickered through Brandon's mind.



Looking down,he avoided Matthew's gaze and stayed silent.



Matthew pleaded, "Sir, I can't let you go. Your grandmother is counting on me to bring you both
together."



Without meeting his eyes, Brandon said, "There's no need for Grandma to know the details." He then started the engine. "I'll return by morning."



Brandon guided the car away from the house, careful to steer around Matthew.



Desperation laced Matthew's voice as he shouted, "Mr.Watson,please! Mr.Watson!"



Brandon caught a glimpse of him in the rearview mirror but kept driving.



City lights blurred past as the Bentley cut through the dark, Brandon's gaze never wavering from the road ahead. Sorting through his feelings proved impossible,leaving only a storm raging inside him.


Confusion reigned over his thoughts. Even his heartbeat felt unsettled and uneven.



Finding a solution to this tangled web of emotions seemed beyond him; he tackled only what little he could manage.



Such uncertainty was foreign territory.



Every deal he handled at work showcased his confidence and calculated moves, yet tonight he felt lost.
Bit by bit, control kept slipping through his fingers.


Fear crept in with that realization.



A slow breath brought him back to the present,and he tried to block out the chaos for now.



Vivian's health demanded his attention, and he knew he had to be by her side.



Soon enough, he reached her apartment building,found a spot to park, and rode the elevator to her floor.



After a moment at her door, he pressed the bell.Vivian answered,appearing before him in the doorway.
###Chapter 74 | Want To Be With You,Brandon
When Vivian opened the door, Brandon found himself surprised by the scene before him.



Vivian greeted him,wearing only a delicate nightgown with thin straps.



A faint frown creased Brandon's brow.



The silence between them lingered, as Vivian, clearly aware of her appearance, refused to meet his eyes and kept her head lowered.



Instead of commenting, Brandon shrugged off his jacket and gently placed it around her shoulders.


"Let's go inside. You'll catch a chill out here," said Brandon.



At last, Vivian gave a small nod and stepped aside,letting him in.



Her eyes drifted over Brandon, quickly picking up on his freshly changed shirt and trousers-a different set from earlier that day when he left her.



Noticing his new clothes made it obvious he had
 gotten dressed again before arriving.



Puzzlement crept in-what possible reason did Brandon have to change, especially when he had spent the evening with Millie under the same roof?



Irritation simmered the longer Vivian dwelled on that thought.



After all the effort she put into taking Millie's place in Brandon's life, she now faced his meddlesome grandparents and the threat of a child who seemed to come out of nowhere.



One misstep, and it could ruin everything Vivian had fought for. What if Millie got pregnant again?


Still, brooding over the situation wouldn't help.Vivian forced herself to remain calm, knowing that composure was her only weapon now.


Taking a spot beside Brandon, Vivian dabbed at her eyes, trying to muffle her sobs.



Uncertainty crept into Brandon's expression as he watched her, not knowing what to say or do.


Eventually, he found his voice. "Can you try to stop crying?"



That only made Vivian's shoulders shake harder, her tears coming faster.
Red-rimmed eyes searched his face as she reached up,clutching at his collar in desperation.



Brandon's brow furrowed as he gently removed her hand from his shirt. "What are you trying to do?"



Tears fell freely as Vivian choked out her question."You promised you'd leave her-you told me you were getting a divorce. Why did you end up with her anyway? It hurts so much, Brandon. I can't take it."



A wave of helplessness washed over Brandon as he looked into her tear-streaked face.



Their eyes met for a long moment before he finally spoke. "I didn't."



A beat of silence passed before he added, "Millie and I didn't do anything. My grandparents just insisted on breakfast tomorrow. That's all."



Vivian's heart lifted at his words. "Is that the truth?"



Turning away, Brandon responded with a quiet, "Yeah."



A flicker of satisfaction crossed Vivian's mind once she realized Brandon wasn't hiding anything.



Millie couldn't accomplish anything,even with all the support in the world.



A sideways glance at Brandon filled Vivian with
confidence; she believed she finally had control.



No matter what Millie did-even if she tried to tempt him in the most obvious ways-Vivian was certain Brandon would remain indifferent.



Despite these smug thoughts, Vivian let her tears fall for effect.



Winning Brandon over fully was her true goal; after that,everything else would fall into place.


The idea emboldened her, so she shifted closer.



Her voice dropped to a whisper as she leaned in, her breath warm against him. "Brandon..."



Tonight's preparations hadn't been for nothing. She had chosen her nightgown carefully and dabbed on a fragrance designed to pull him closer.



Without hesitation, Vivian let herself rest against his shoulder,the image of vulnerability.


In a gentle tone, she said, "I'm sorry for doubting you.I just... couldn't help but worry."


Brandon discreetly shifted away from her, hoping to put a bit more space between them.



Upon catching Brandon's retreat, Vivian's reddened eyes fixed on him. "Why are you pulling away from me?"

Brandon didn't meet her gaze, instead asking quietly,"Are you feeling all right? Is everything okay with your health?"



That question gave Vivian pause; she mistook his retreat for concern about her well-being.



A shy flush colored her cheeks as she answered, "I'm fine. I just want you to stay with me tonight. Please?I really am okay."



Both of them knew exactly what her invitation meant -there was no need for subtlety between adults.



Rather than feeling drawn in, Brandon felt tension building in his temples.


Vivian's intentions were perfectly clear, and still, he couldn't find any interest.



Despite her alluring nightgown and the perfume she had carefully chosen, his body and mind simply wouldn't respond.



Desire was nowhere to be found.



Edging closer, Vivian reached for his hand and tried to guide it to her chest.



That was enough-Brandon pushed himself up from the couch.
Brandon?" Vivian called after him, confused.



Facing away, he spoke in an even tone. "You're not well.Get some rest."



A tremor crept into Vivian's question. "Is there something about me you just don't like?"



No response came fromn Brandon.



Tears made her words wobble. "Why is she allowed,but I'm not?"



She left nothing hidden. "I want to be with you,Brandon. Can't we just have this one night?"



Brandon's feelings didn't change. There was no spark,no interest.



Making for the door, he tossed out a reason. "I need to go. Grandma expects me for breakfast tomorrow morning."



Vivian's cry stopped him in his tracks, raw and pleading."Brandon!"



Spinning around, Brandon caught sight of her, utterly exposed and shaking with emotion.



Tears streaked her cheeks as she begged. "Why can't you just give me what I want,just this once?"
Without hesitating, he shut the door behind him to keep her out of the possible prying eyes from the hallway and moved toward her.


Gently, he gathered her clothes and draped them over her shoulders.



His voice was tired, stripped of all pretense. "I just don't have it in me tonight. I'm completely worn out."



Absolutely no desire stirred within him, not even the faintest hint.



Nakedness did nothing to bridge the distance between them; Brandon felt empty inside as he looked at Vivian.



He managed only a quiet, "Take care of yourself."


Vivian's sobs grew louder, pain cracking through each breath.



A desperate plea tumbled out. "But you promised,Brandon. You said you'd grant my wish. I'm running out of time, and you still won't touch me."


She asked further, voice trembling, "Is it Millie? Do you still love her?"



Tears streaming down her face, Vivian kept begging."Just once-please. Pretend I'm her if you have to.l just want you tonight."



That shattered image of Millie, her face stained with tears, flashed across Brandon's mind, confusion twisting inside him.



He kept his tone gentle but distant. "Try get some rest. I'm leaving now. The doctor will come by to check on you soon."



Vivian's scream echoed in the room, ragged with heartbreak. "I don't want a doctor!"



Glancing over his shoulder, Brandon caught the raw question in her eyes. "Is it... do you think I'm unclean?"



Utterly undone, Vivian broke down. "All this time,you've never touched me. Is it because of what happened that day?"



Shoulders drooping, Brandon stayed silent, his hands balled tight at his sides.


A harsh,humorless laugh broke from Vivian. "I knew it.I'm cheap. I'm filthy." Regret crept into her voice. "But this isn't what I ever wanted, Brandon..."



She couldn't bring herself to finish the sentence.



Those words left her utterly drained, her body giving out as she collapsed in a heap, racked with sobs.
Brandon stood motionless, watching her fall apart on the floor,his right hand beginning to shake.



Moments ticked by before he finally crouched beside her and held out a tissue.



With a voice barely above a whisper, he said, "You're not to blame for any of it. I am."


At that moment, the doctor Brandon had called knocked on the door. He gently helped Vivian into her clothes and invited the doctor inside.



One look at the doctor and Vivian's eyes filled with fear.



Worry gnawed at her, terrified of her secrets being exposed.
###Chapter 75 He Had Almost Fallen For It
Vivian lowered her head again, her voice trembling as she forced out a cry. "Brandon, I'm okay now. I really don't want to see a doctor."



Brandon frowned. "Your health isn't great. Seeing a doctor might help ease things a little."


The doctor beside them gave a small nod.



He'd heard about Vivian's illness-who hadn't? The media had been all over it, and he couldn't help but feel sorry for her.



Vivian managed a weak smile. "It's fine. I'll just take some painkillers."



Then she added in a low voice, laced with dry humor,"What's one more day or one less? It doesn't change much anymore."



She looked over at Brandon again.



He didn't meet her gaze. Instead, he waved the doctor off and helped her up from the couch, walking her toward the bedroom.
This has nothing to do with you. he said flatly I'm just exhausted from handling my grandparents today Im really not in the mood You need to rast So get some proper sleep


He called the caregiver who had stepped out when the doctor arrived back in



"Take care of her. Brandon instructed.



The caregiver didn't reply right away and instead looked to Vivian. uncertain.



Vivian held on to Brandon with her eyes.



He reached out and patted her gently on the head.


"I can't let my grandparents know i'm here. I'll come by when i can," Brandon said.



Vivian knew better than to keep pretending now. She couldn't risk him calling the doctor back.


So she turned her face to the side and kept up the image of being hurt



Brandon gave one last reminder to the caregiver and turned to leave



But just as he reached the door. Vivian's voice drifted after him, soft and bitter "I don't know what she said to you tonight... but Brandon. I just want to know  you really feel. Is the issue with the child really sottled?Who's that child? She's using your grandparents-and the child-to reel you back in. Are you really going to let her?"



Brandon paused for a heartbeat. But he didn't turn around. He kept walking. The door closed quietly behind him.



Vivian clenched her jaw as she looked at the caregiver, who was quietly tidying up nearby. She flung whatever she could grab in frustration.


How humiliating!



She had practically thrown herself at him-standing completely naked in front of him-yet he still wouldn't touch her.



It was totally unacceptable.



She couldn't let the Watson family keep pulling Brandon back to Millie.



Her thoughts spun quickly, and within seconds, she picked up her phone and made a call.


Brandon left the apartment building, walked out into the night, and slid into the driver's seat of his Bentley.But he didn't drive off right away.



He lit a cigarette, rolled down the window,and stared into the drifting smoke as it curled into the air.


That event a year ago... he still didn't feel like thinking about it.



The incident had changed so many things.



Vivian's parting words kept repeating in his mind.



His head began to ache, and he pressed his fingers into his temples.


Brandon knew Vivian sometimes went too far. He wasn't blind to it.



But she only had six months left.



After that... after she was gone, things would go back to how they used to be.



The cigarette burned down to the filter.



Brandon flicked it out, picked up his phone, and called Darden. Then he started the engine.







At Blue Lounge, the music throbbed through the floor and spilled into the streets.



Inside one of the dark, private rooms, Brandon sat quietly, separated from the crowd below, watching them dance to the rhythm. The door opened, and Darden walked in.



"Drinking alone now?" he asked, raising an eyebrow.



Brandon gestured to the table beside him,where a glass, a bucket of ice, and a few unopened bottles waited.



Darden took the seat next to him, and Brandon quietly poured him a drink.



Neither of them sat on the cushy leather couch. They both leaned against the low-lit bar counter.



"What happened?" Darden asked after a sip. "I heard your grandpa called you back to Moonlit Estate with Millie?"



"Yeah." Brandon stared down at the ice in his glass before looking out over the dancing crowd.



"That what's got you all worked up?" Darden pressed,tilting his glass.



Brandon didn't answer right away.



His head was a mess-Millie's tears, Vivian's breakdown... All of it tangled and heavy in his thoughts.



Almost without meaning to, Brandon asked, "That woman you talked about last time-what's going on with you guys that now?"


Darden, who had been waiting for Brandon to open up,was disappointed.


"Oh,so we're talking about me now? Trying to feel better by laughing at my drama?"


Brandon didn't say anything. He hadn't meant it that way. It had just slipped out.


Seeing Brandon distracted, Darden let it go and downed another sip before continuing, "It's still a mess. She's still freezing me out. I mean, I might not run something as big as Watson Group, but I'm still the heir to my family's company. She can't keep treating me like I'm nothing. I've tried everything. Flowers,designer bags, apology notes, her favorite food..nothing gets through. Booked a table at her favorite place-Michelin-starred, mind you-she didn't even show up. Whenever I call, she's busy. Whenever | text,no reply. She's making sure I feel it."


Then he sighed, sounding more tired than angry now.


Rubbing his head, Darden finally said, "I get it. It's about that McCoy girl. I was dumb. I shouldn't have gone shopping with her. Now Alyssa's making sure l learn my lesson."


 
Brandon listened,watching the dancers.Darden's situation wasn't that different from his point of view.



Vivian's voice echoed in his mind again. "Have you sorted out the issue with the child? Is the issue with the child really settled? Who's that child? She's using your grandparents-and the child-to reel you back in.Are you really going to let her?"



He had told Millie nothing would change, and she would still be his wife six months later. She could've just waited quietly for these six months to pass. She could've even left the country for a while. Instead,she chose to behave this way.


Maybe she was trying to raise her value in the long run.Make sure that when they got married again, it would be under her terms.



And the child-whether it was his or not-was the biggest lever. His grandparents would insist on seeing the child,and Millie knew that.


She knew the reason behind their rushed marriage.She also knew what the loss of their baby had done to him.



Brandon's eyes darkened.



She was clever. Calculated.
He had almost fallen for it.
The next morning came quickly.



Millie went through the clothes she had stored away here and found a simple, elegant dress.



After freshening up, she made her way toward Derek and Norma's villa.



But just as she reached the path leading to the door,Brandon's car pulled up.



Not wanting another scene, she picked up her pace.



"Millie!" She had barely moved when Brandon pulled in,stepped out, and came to stand quietly at her side.



She didn't answer and kept walking towards the house.



In the next second, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her off the path, into the woods. He pressed her back against a tree. And then, without a word, he kissed her -hard.

"Brandon, what are you doing..." she started,but the rest of her words disappeared beneath his lips.
###Chapter 76 You're Millie!
Heat pressed against Millie's lips, but all she felt was the sting of humiliation.

No matter how desperately she thrashed, Brandon's grip locked her in place, leaving her powerless.

Fury and shame tangled inside her chest. Millie bit down hard, the metallic taste of blood blooming on her tongue.

Only then did Brandon let go,freeing her at last.


He drew himself up, using the back of his hand to wipe away the blood on his lips.

Before Millie could raise her arm to slap him, Brandon intercepted her, trapping her wrist firmly against the rough bark.

A blaze of outrage swept through her.How could he treat her like this?

He had spent the night in Vivian's arms, only to show up at dawn and force this on Millie.

Did he come here just to humiliate her?

The entire situation left her sick to her stomach.

Did he come here just to humiliate her?



The entire situation left her sick to her stomach.



Hatred simmered, boiling over as she aimed a kick at him.
Brandon stopped her, quick and unyielding.



"Millie, do you really think I'll let things play out the way they did before?" His tone was cold,every word edged with warning.



Yesterday, she'd caught him off guard. If he'd been ready,there's no way she would have landed that blow.



For a fleeting moment, he believed Millie had finally chosen peace. Yet here she was, proving him wrong once again.


She had turned him down outright, but all her actions -letting the child call her "mom," coming back to the Watson home-looked to Brandon like moves in a bigger game, all designed to sway him through his grandparents.



Suspicion fueled Brandon's temper, making it burn even hotter.



Was this really the same woman he used to know?



Once,she'd been the picture of kindness and patience.



Any softness he felt for her the night before now felt like nothing more than humiliation.



His fingers dug harder into her wrist, and Millie winced at the pain.
Try as she might, there was no breaking free from his hold. It drove her crazy, realizing just how much stronger he was.



If not for the drunken mess she'd been last night-and the need to give answers to Norma and Derek-she never would have stayed a second longer.


Frustration erupted from her in a shout. "What exactly do you want from me?"


Brandon leveled a warning, voice low and sharp."Watch what you say to Grandpa and Grandma. Millie,don't give me any more reasons to hate you."


A sharp laugh nearly escaped Millie's lips.



She retorted coldly, "And who are you to talk to me like that? Are you speaking as my soon-to-be ex-husband?"



Brandon's reply was a harsh bark. "Millie!"


A hard edge crept into Millie's voice. "Take your hands off me." Her glare held steady. "Unless you're the kind of man who only knows how to push others around with brute force!"


Their voices carried through the trees, making it
 impossible for Matthew to ignore the argument any longer. Although he had considered stepping in, he now only managed a weary sigh.



A disappointed look crossed Matthew's face as he watched the pair bickering in the distance. "You'd hoped a night together would help them talk things out and move forward, Mrs. Watson," he murmured,shaking his head and releasing a heavy sigh. "Now their troubles only/ seem worse. What on earth are we supposed to do next?"



Still brooding,he watched Millie and Brandon march toward the villa, their argument far from over. Not wanting to interfere, he kept a careful distance behind them.



The morning dawned with a cold silence at the breakfast table. Not a word passed between Millie and Brandon as they ate. Later, when Millie sat down with Derek and Norma, she skillfully sidestepped the whole tanzanite issue at the auction, beginning instead with Charles' invitation and quickly explaining her plans to adopt Ari.


No opposition came from Derek and Norma regarding Millie's wish to put Ari's name under her mother's on the register.



In their minds, for all the heated words and standoffs,Millie and Brandon's marriage still stood. With time,
every misunderstanding could be mended, and the promise of children remained on the horizon.



Reminders of recent closeness between husband and wife lingered-Brandon's lips still bore proof.



On top of everything, neither was old enough for formal adoption just yet, making this the only workable solution.



Welcoming another child into the family hardly seemed a burden. If Millie felt drawn to care for Ari,then their hope was simple-she would pour her love and attention into raising the little girl well.


"When you get a chance, Millie, bring Ari by for a visit."A gentle reminder slipped from Derek.



Reluctance bubbled up in MMillie,but she knew full well how much sway the Watson Group carried in Crobert.If Derek wished to see Ari, nothing would really stop him.



Choosing her battles, Millie decided it was smarter to agree on her own terms. That way, she could manage the details of their meetings. Besides, Derek never struck her as someone who would stoop to low tactics.



She answered him with a quiet nod.



Catching that gesture, Brandon became even more certain about his own suspicions.



He gave nothing away, however, simply lowering his gaze and staying silent in front of Derek.



A few pleasantries later, their time at Watson Mansion wrapped up.



Stepping away from Moonlit Estate, Millie made her way straight to her car.


Every move was practiced: opening the door, buckling up, turning the key, and pulling away all flowed together seamlessly.



Not once did she glance in Brandon's direction.



From the curb, Brandon could only watch as Millie sped off without hesitation. He kept behind her for a block, but at the next intersection, their paths split-his car veering away in the opposite direction.



She went to pick up Ari and then dropped her off at school for the day. No sooner had she left than her phone rang with a call from Alexia.


On the line, Alexia's voice brimmed with energy."Millie, can you come by? We're working on pulling the data from Tia's phone!"



Word had first reached Millie after the second live stream of Heavenly Melody-Alexia mentioned she caught someone filming the event in secret. That evening， the two discussed it further， and是he learnt the spectator wanted to expose the truth but lacked the proof to do so.



Trust began to build after a few more conversations,and Alexia eventually verified the details the person shared.



Connecting with the expert Giffard had recommended proved tricky, since he was currently overseas and shipping the device would be complicated.



Only yesterday, Alexia had sat down with Seville. As soon as he heard about the phone, his enthusiasm to get involved was obvious.



Today, the plan was to meet Seville's brother to try and recover the lost data.



Nerves still had a hold on Alexia, despite her confidence. "Millie, I know | could probably handle this myself, but it would mean a lot if you came and helped us figure out our next steps," she said over the phone.



Agreement came easily to Millie as she slowed the car with a gentle press of the brake.



Not wasting a second, she added, "I'm on my way.Just text me the details." The moment their call ended, a new message buzzed on her phone with the address.



Without hesitation, Millie spun the wheel and redirected herself to meet Alexia.



A short drive later, her car slipped into a parking space in front of the building.



Her steps took her up to the seventh floor, where she paused and pressed the button for apartment 716.



The door swung open just moments later, revealing Alexia's eager face.



Joy practically radiated from Alexia as she spotted Millie. "You made it!" she blurted out,excitement lighting up her features.


For days, Alexia had been counting down to this moment.



Guilt had weighed on her since Millie's accident.Finally making some progress with the data to help Millie felt like a baby step toward making things right.



The possibility of Seville bringing that crucial audio into the open meant Vivian would finally face the consequences.



Reaching into her pocket, Alexia pulled out a mask. "Need one of these? I never shared your actual identity with Seville," she whispered.



Millie simply offered a smile and shook her head.



Seville had shown nothing but sincerity, his actions proving he truly wanted to help.


Because of that, Millie decided he deserved her trust.


Stepping over the threshold, she pulled the door shut and met Seville as he came forward. A small nod and an outstretched hand signaled her greeting.


With a calmn voice, she introduced herself. "Hello, I'm Serena."



Recognition shot across Seville's face, his mouth half -open in shock before he managed to cover it.



A beat passed before his astonishment tumbled out."Wait-you're Millie!"
###Chapter 77 Irrefutable Proof Found
Seville had only gone to watch the live stage of Heavenly Melody out of curiosity. At that point, he had only been a casual fan of Vivian.



But her terminal cancer, her charity efforts, and the strength she showed while comforting others facing the same situation had left a strong impression.She seemed graceful, courageous, and truly admirable.


The reason Seville decided to post Serena's live footage had little to do with Vivian herself. The truth was, it all began with frustration. He had been attacked in online debates, unfairly blamed, and silenced by faceless trolls. That video was his way of pushing back.


The fact that Millie showed up in front of him,introducing herself as Serena caught him completely off guard.


Whispers about Vivian's tangled affair with Brandon were all over social media, and Millie-Brandon's wife -was always dragged into the mess.


According to the Internet, she was pathetic. A fragile,spoiled woman who clung to her husband for money most and couldn't even do anything on her own. A background figure with no strength of her own. But Serena, that radiant woman on stage? Could she and Millie really be the same woman?



"Wait... this can't be real," he muttered, eyes wide."You're nothing like what they talk about online."



He had attended both shows. One great performance might be sheer luck, sure. But Serena's flawless consistency and her commanding presence on stage proved she had genuine talent.


She wasn't weak. She wasn't passive. She was powerful in a way the Internet had never shown.


"God," Seville whispered. "You're Serena... This is so unbelievable!"



"Told you," Alexia said beside him, arms crossed."I've been saying it from the beginning. Vivian getting involved in someone else's marriage. Not exactly the noble image she was selling. You were the one who told me to ignore it. You said you just wanted to shut the trolls up, remember? But now you finally see the truth, don't you? Vivian was the one who tampered with the video and audio. She ordered someone to mess it up, and used Brandon's name to do it-the man who's still legally Millie's husband. They haven't divorce yet, mind you. Think about it. Charles runs Evans Entertainment-the same company backing Heavenly Melody. Do you think anyone else would've dared to sabotage Serena's performance knowing she works for Charles? She's their top performer, even."


Seville still looked confused. "But... why would she do that? Does Vivian even know who Serena really is?"



Millie gently shook her head. "No. Other than Charles,only the people in this room knowN the truth."



"Even the makeup artist has never seen her face,"Alexia added with a smirk.



Seville frowned, trying to connect the dots. "But...I still don't get it."



"Oh, seriously?" Alexia rolled her eyes and nudged Millie further inside. "It's not that complicated. Vivian can't stand the idea of someone-anyone-outshining her. That's always been how she is. She wants to be the center of attention, so anyone else who shines becomes a threat. You've always seen the best in her,so you never noticed the rest. That's the problem."



Seville didn't respond. The shock still hadn't worn off.Millie stayed quiet too, understanding what was happening. Alexia's words had struck a nerve. Seville had once admired Vivian, maybe even idolized her.And Millie knew when someone you looked up to fell off that pedestal, it took time to accept.



Without another word, Millie followed Alexia further into the apartment.



The neighborhood they'd entered had become trendy in recent years, known for its clean streets and high-end facilities. Most of the residents were professionals -tech experts, software engineers, and developers with lucrative stock options and deep connections in the industry. Quiet money. Smart money.



The house itself had a sleek, modern design-minimalist, almost cold. It gave off the vibe of someone precise and data-driven, like a software architect with no time for clutter. Definitely not Seville's style.



Millie glanced at Seville again. He stood there in his bold anime shirt, covered in brightly colored artwork,completely out of place in the calm, muted environment.



Noticing her look, Seville quickly snapped out of his thoughts. "Oh-uh, this isn't my place," he said,rubbing the back of his neck. "It's my brother's. He's the one doing the ddata recovery."



By then,Alexia had already led Millie down the hallway to a closed door. She knocked gently.



"Come in," a man's voice called from inside.


 
Alexia pushed the door open. The room mirrored the minimalist design of the rest of the house-clean lines, muted colors-but this one was packed with electronics. Wires, monitors, and drives covered the desks. It looked more like a tech lab than a living space.



Alexia shot Millie a quick glance before nudging Seville to step in first.



Maybe the person inside didn't like being interrupted...or just had a short fuse.



"Yo, bro, is the data recovery done?" Seville asked casually, stepping inside like he owned the place."brought them over."



As soon as he spoke, Alexia nudged Millie gently, and the two of them moved toward the center of the room.



"Almost finished," the man replied without looking up.He wore black-rimmed glasses and focused intently on the screen in front of him. Millie watched the progress bar tick toward completion. Then, with a small click,it was done.



The man turned in his chair. "It's ready. You can go through it-see what you need or want to save."



He didn't offer a greeting, didn't ask any questions,and juststepped aside so they could take a look. His demeanor was precise, detached-almost robotic.



Alexia pointed to herself. "Want me to do it?" Since the phone belonged to her friend, it made sense for Alexia to handle it instead of letting someone else dig through the files.



"Yeah, go ahead." Seville nodded, moving aside to chat quietly with his brother.



Millie stayed nearby, her eyes fixed on the screen while Alexia started clicking through folders.



The room settled into an eerie quiet, broken only by the soft clicks of the mouse.



"That's Millie," Seville whispered to his brother."Brandon's wife... and also Serena."



He probably thought his voice was low enough, but Millie heard it.



She felt someone's eyes flick toward her, and then look away just as fast.



Then, Alexia's voice rang out, cutting through the silence."Found it!"



"Seriously? Let me check if it's any good!" Seville rushed over, eyes wide with excitement as the video started playing. "Guess Tia's got a whole collection of phones," Alexia joked, chuckling. One device was running their video call during the livestream, while another captured video from a different angle.



No wonder she was such a pro at snatching phones-this clearly wasn't her first time pulling off something like this.



"This is actually decent," Seville said with a nod. "Not top-tier gear, but still miles ahead of a lot of the junk floating around online."



"What's your take on it, Millie?" Alexia asked.


Millie, who had been quietly observing, gave a gentle smile and nodded in agreement.



"With this video out there, let's see how those trolls try to slander me again," Seville said, his voice tight with resentment.



"Is it really enough?" his brother asked, arms crossed."Might not turn out the way you're hoping."



"Oh, come on, the live performance was amazing!"Sevillereplied, a little louder than necessary.



Alexia didn't speak. She simply looked at Millie,waiting for her take on it.
 Millie stepped forward and grabbed the mouse,dragging the video's progress bar back and forth,replaying certain moments with a thoughtful expression. After a beat, she said, "It'll work."



Seville's brother didn't look convinced. His frown deepened slightly.



Millie understood his hesitation-a phone recording could never fully capture the magic of a live performance. He likely assumed Seville was overhyping it.


And if the footage didn't meet the expectations Seville had built up, the backlash could be just as harsh.


"We just need the right timing-then it'll make the impact we're aiming for," Millie said calmly.


At that moment, her phone buzzed.


Glancing at the screen, she saw Charles' name flashing.



She picked up with a steady voice. "Hi, Charles."



"Fantastic update, Millie!" Charles' voice crackled with triumph. "I finally cornered Oakley and his people.They're under our control now. We can kick him out -today,tomorrow, or even right this second. Just say the word!"
Millie's lips curved into a slow smile as she listened to his laughter.

At last, the opening she had waited for was here.
###Chapter 78 The Bite Mark On The Lips
Sunlight gleamed off polished surfaces as Millie addressed Charles, saying, "I've got something to show you. Want to drop by and check it out?"


With barely a pause, Charles answered, "Just send the location. I'll come right over!"


Once the call ended, Millie surveyed the group. A small, confident smile touched her lipsas she said,"Heavenly Melody's third live show is only two days away. Let's get started with our prep. Charles will join us soon so we can iron out all the plans."


Her attention then shifted to Seville and Alexia.


Right now, nothing mattered more to her than advancing her own career and saving every penny,determined to someday reclaim the Bennett family's old property from Brandon.


Gaining recognition and commercial deals through a win in the popular show was the fastest way to reach that goal.


Still, Vivian's ongoing meddling with their broadcast quality threatened to tip the public voting against Millie. This could not continue.


Determination sharpened her words. "This time, we go all out and win-no exceptions!"


"You got it!" Seville and Alexia responded together, enthusiasm bright in their eyes.
Both of them had been waiting for an opportunity like this.

Turning her gaze to the man in glasses-the owner of this apartment--Millie waited for his response.

He offered a careless nod and said, "Feel free to use the living room or any of the other rooms. Just leave this room alone."

A round of nods passed through the group.

Alexia, with a warm grin, spoke up. "Sheridan, you didn't get any breakfast yet, right? I ordered some for us. Want me to bring yours to your room later?"

Sheridan Nicolson met her eyes. The usual coolness in his expression softened a touch.

"Thank you," he answered.

Without another word, Millie glanced from Alexia to Sheridan, and then quietly exited the room with her companions in tow.

Breakfast was underway and everyone lingered, anticipation building for Charles' arrival and the planning session to come. Suddenly, a new hashtag surged across social media-#BrandonSplitLip#.

A popular post under that tag captured Brandon, sharp in a tailored suit, striding into the Watson Group headquarters.

His striking features-those piercing eyes, sculpted nose, and clean jawline-demanded attention as always.

Charisma radiated from every angle of his face.

Despite his commanding presence, a glaring split marred his lower lip, asif someone had taken a bite out of it.

Could it have been a woman behind that mark?

The Internet had been abuzz with Brandon's name lately, mostly tied to Vivian's impending demise.

This new development sent rumors flying in every direction.

One comment said, "Seriously, are we supposed to believe he bit his own lip by accident?"
Another chimed in, "That mark looks too fresh. Who's bold enough to do that to him?"

"Who else could it be but Vivian? Those two have been joined at the hip for ages. Maybe they're finally ready to show off their relationship."

"That's right. Brandon's left MMillie in the dust. Vivian's the only one on his mind now, so the answer's obvious."

"Looks like things got wild between them last night! Take it easy, Mr. Watson. Poor Vivian's not in the best shape-don't overdo it."

Speculation exploded online, sending a stampede of reporters and photographers straight to the doors of Vivian Floral Design, all eager for a statement.

The news soon reached Vivian herself.

Fury built inside her, jaw tight enough to make her molars ache.

There was no way she had left that mark. Brandon's lips were unblemished when he stopped by last night. Clearly, whatever happened to his lip had to have taken place after he left. But what exactly had gone on between him and Millie?

"Miss Simpson, there's a crowd gathering outside." Concern tinged her caregiver's voice.

Vivian's glare darkened as she took in the scene beyond her window.

She realized a response was unavoidable. However, she absolutely could not let anyone find out that Millie was behind the bite.

With Brandon and Millie's divorce still pending, the two remained married in the eyes of the law.Recently, Vivian had been stirring up drama to prove that Brandon's affections lay with her, and that only the unloved one could be considered the third wheel in a relationship.

Revealing that Brandon and Millie were still intimately involved would spell disaster for Vivian's reputation.

Claiming responsibility for the bite was also out of the question-Millie could easily expose the truth.

Her mind raced, searching for a workable solution.
An idea sparked. She scrolled through her phone, landed on a familiar name, and quickly dialed.

Meanwhile,outside Vivian's studio, the commotion only grew.

People elbowed their way closer, vying for a better view.

Frustration simmered as time dragged on with no sign of Vivian.

At last, the entrance swung open.

Vivian appeared, leaning on her caregiver for support.

Color had drained from her face, leaving her looking fragile.

With a voice barely above a whisper, she said, "Forgive me, I'm not well today."

Everyone present sympathized, aware that she'd been given only half a year to live.

A reporter called out, "Miss Simpson, were you the one who bit Mr. Watson's lip?"

Another chimed in, "Miss Simpson, have you and Mr. Watson become romantically involved?"

A third voice called out, "Miss Simpson..."

Curiosity surged, but the staff formed a protective barrier, keeping the eager crowd from getting too close to Vivian.

A hint of pink crept into Vivian's cheeks as the barrage of questions continued, her usual composure giving way to a bashful glance.

Excitement rippled through the onlookers, making them all the more certain of their suspicions.

With a gentle cough, Vivian steadied herself before addressing the assembly."Everyonshe said,her voice soft but clear. "I'd rather we not get caught up in rumors and speculation," she said, sidestepping the subject entirely as she moved the conversation elsewhere.

"Today, I'm happy to announce some exciting news. Vivian Floral Design has joined forces with a film studio to produce a web series inspired by my song Glimmer of Love. Not only that, but the theme song for the series will be Glimmer of Love itself.Please look forward to it."

A graceful bow followed her words, her dignity intact.
Interest lingered in the crowd, but the hunger for gossip remained. Vivian's lips curved into a gentle smile as she continued, "I truly hope you'll pay closer attention to my work on behalf of the chronically ill. My aim is to spread hope and resilience-may you help me share that spirit."

By shifting the focus, Vivian painted herself as a figure of virtue.

A fresh wave of coughing broke up her speech, and she offered a quiet apology. "I'm running out of time, so you'll have to forgive me."

With her caregiver's steady arm, Vivian disappeared back into her studio.

Clips of her response swept across the Internet, drawing admiration for her compassion and excitement for the upcoming series. The question about the bite faded from people's minds-her shy demeanor had spoken volumes.

In another part of town, Alexia caught wind of the headlines and threw up her hands in outrage."Unbelievable! Brandon spent last night with you at Moonlit Estate, so what's Vivian pretending to blush about?" Alexia's irriation was unmistakable.

Seville's eyes lingered on Millie, a spark of intrigue in her gaze.

Taking another mouthful, Millie finally broke the silence. "Vivian called and asked him to come by last night."

The moment she finished, everyone at the table seemed to process that news in their own way. Millie continued, her tone casual, "Still, I was the one who bit Brandon. He came home this morning in a mood and tried to kiss me out of nowhere. I wasn't having it, so I bit him. Simple as that."

Alexia's hand balled into a fist as she replied, "Now it makes sense."

A different light dawned in Seville's eyes, revealing just how much Vivian's actions puzzled him.

But for Millie, none of that mattered right now.

Her thoughts turned entirely to Vivian's next move-plans to relaunch Glimmer of Love.

Pushing boundaries seemed to be Vivian's specialty; even with a legal notice from Evans Entertainment's lawyers, she was doubling down, showing no sign of backing away.

Maybe it was Brandon's influence that gave her such nerve.
In the grand scheme, Millie knew it would not last. The higher Vivian tried to climb, the further she would tumble once the truth emerged.
Amidst the conversation and clinking cutlery, the sharp ring of the doorbell cut through the air.Charles had made his entrance.
###Chapter 79 The Third Live Broadcast
Charles entered the room with a composed expression. "I thought you should know," he began,"we're in control now. We can remove Oakley whenever we want."

Millie's lips curved into a pleased smile. "That's exactly what I wanted to hear."

She had already started laying out her plan the moment she sent Alexia to Tia for the footage. But with this latest update, things were falling into place better than she had hoped.

Charles had managed to settle the internal conflicts at Evans Entertainment, and the recent charity gala seemed to have tilted public opinion in their favor.

Adjusting her strategy slightly, Millie turned to those gathered. "Charles, you mentioned before that Vivian's PR team is sharp. That means we have to be even sharper. There is no room for error."

Charles gave a firm nod in agreement.

Seville, seated quietly nearby, took it all in. There had been a time when he admired Vivian. But now,after everything he had seen, he realized just how wrong he'd been.

He recalled an article from not too long ago that had praised Vivian as a noble figure, all while subtly dragging Millie down. It had made him doubt Millie back then.

Millie's voice broke the silence."The next Heavenly Melody broadcast is in two days. I've got a plan in mind-let me lay it out, and you can tell me what you think. We'll move in steps. Step one..."

···

The day before the broadcast, things took an unexpected turn.

An old topic started resurfacing online-the live sound quality of Yesterday, a performance that had barely gotten attention before. But suddenly, people were talking.

A video had appeared, uploaded by Seville. He claimed it wasa live recording from that live show.

The clip, however, was grainy and poorly recorded from within the crowd. The sound was unclear, and no faces could be seen. It was footage Seville had picked up from a contact in the scalper group chat-
one that had previously been dismissed as useless since the sound quality was just as bad.

Still, curiosity drove people to click. The video spread quickly.

Vivian's team saw it too. But Johnny waved off the concern. "Relax," he said. "If that's all they've managed to dig up after all this time, we've got nothing to worry about."

Vivian let out a cold sneer. "Show them who's in charge."

"On it," Johnny replied, immediately mobilizing an online crowd to flood the Internet with criticism aimed at Seville.

But Seville watched their every move calmly, a faint smile playing on his lips.

This was exactly what Millie had planned.

It was the first step-one that served two purposes: first, to settle old scores and give Vivian's team the illusion that everything was under control; and second, to quietly gather proof of their digital smear campaign for a counterattack later.

Meanwhile,Vivian instructed Oakley to slip a few of her people into the live audience.

"Why? What do you want them to do?" Oakley raised an eyebrow. "Honestly, Charles is a nobody. Even without my grandfather pulling strings, he's not going to shake things up. I've got this under control."

Vivian crossed her arms, irritation flaring in her eyes. "Just follow my instructions. I have my reasons."

Oakley shook his head. "Look,the external voting stats are clear. Serena doesn't stand a chance of making it to the finals. So what exactly are you worried about?"

"Just do what I told you," Vivian snapped, her tone leaving no room for argument.

Her mind, however, was restless. The bite mark she had noticed on Brandon's lips had unsettled her.

Though she believed she had himn fully wrapped around her finger, Millie still posed a dangerous,personal threat-one that had to be dealt with swiftly.

To do that, she needed Serena on her side.

Her previous attempts had failed. No amount of persuasion or incentives had worked on Serena.So now, coercion was the only option.

Vivian had a card up her sleeve. She knew Serena's secret: the miscarriage. With that knowledge as leverage, Serena wouldn't dare defy her.

Still, Serena's continued indifference, her calm refusal to bow to Vivian's authority, was infuriating.

Vivian gritted her teeth. She wasn't the type to back down. She would make Serena surrender-no matter what it took.

The following day, Jayceon was preparing to go out when a message pinged on his phone-it was from his brother Myron.

He blinked at the screen. He was being asked to accompany Myron to the third live broadcast of Heavenly Melody.

"Huh?" Jayceon muttered, confused.

He remembered suggesting to attend the last broadcast, but that was only because Serena had caught his eye after the charity auction. Since then, his interest had cooled

Why was Myron suddenly asking him to go again?

Raising a brow, he messaged back, "Wait... do you have a thing for her, Myron? | thought she was with Charles."

Myron replied with a simnple message. "No, nothing like that. She just seems interesting...and possibly useful for our current plans."

Jayceon read the message and straightened up, his expression shifting to something more serious. If Myron thought Serena had potential, it was worth paying attention.

At the same time, high above the city in the Watson Group's executive office, Brandon stood silently by the wvindow. He stared out at the sky, watching clouds drift past with calm detachment, his thoughts far away.
Time moved quickly. Spring was settling in, and the air was warming.
Twenty days had passed since Brandon and Millie filed for divorce and it would soon become official.And it was also the day of the third live broadcast of Heavenly Melody.

The competition had become fierce. Originally, there had been twelve contestants. Three had been eliminated during the last round, but one had returned through a revival vote, leaving ten still in the game.

Now, five more were about to face elimination, with only one chance for a comeback.

As always, Millie wore her mask to keep her identity hidden. After checking her appearance one last time in the car, she stepped out and made her way backstage.

Alexia and Seville were already in position, everything prepared. Even Sheridan, who usually ignored entertainment shows, glanced at the television as he walked past the living room.

Backstage, someone hurried over to Vivian. "Vivian, that person showed up again. This is the third time. What do you want us to do?"

Vivian didn't need to ask who they meant. The same man had been trying to ask uncomfortable questions about the demo-too persistent for her liking.

"Same as before," she said coolly. "Keep him busy for now. We'll deal with him later."

"Understood," the person replied, and then quickly left to follow her orders.

Just then, Millie arrived backstage and happened to catch a glimpse of Vivian dismissing someone with a flick of her hand.

Vivian looked up and spotted Millie. A familiar smile curved on her lips as she walked over.

"Ready for round three?" Vivian asked lightly, her voice smooth as silk. "You seem much healthier these days.I heard you've been training with Alex's team. That's impressive."

Millie offered a polite smile but didn't respond with words.

She had already instructed Charles to wait until she was on stage before making any moves against Oakley's planted people. That meant Oakley still had no idea what was coming.

Milie wasn't sure whether Oakley was secretly working with Vivian, but either way, she saw no reason to share anything with her now.
"Let's have a quick chat," Vivian suddenly said, gesturing toward the staff corridor. "No cameras over there."

Millie didn't budge. She had no interest in small talk, especially not with Vivian.
"It's about the broadcast's influence," Vivian added smoothly. "You know exactly what I'm talking about."

Millie paused. Was Vivian aware that Charles had alreadytaken control behind the scenes? If so, this conversation might be worth hearing. She gave a small nod and followed.
The two women walked off toward the side corridor.
Just a few doors down, in a small, dimly lit room, the atmosphere was electric.
"Boss! Boss!" someone called out, eyes glued to a grainy monitor. "Vivian and Serena are heading to the staff corridor again!"
His voice stirred the others into motion. Two people rushed over, eyes locked on the screen. "Ooh, I bet they're about to drop something juicy again,"one of them said, practically bouncing with excitement.

The one they called "Boss" leaned in, rubbing his hands together eagerly."Let's see what secrets they're sharing today... maybe we'll land another headline-worthy scoop."
###Chapter 80 Her Sterling Reputation Will Crumble

Previously, these paparazzi had captured only audio recordings, but after landing two major exclusives consecutively,they strategically positioned concealed pinhole cameras in the corridor this time.

Meanwhile,Millie and Vivian had made their way into the staff corridor, their footsteps echoing softly against the polished floors.

"So, what's all this really about?" Millie inquired with characteristic directness, cutting through any pretense.

Vivian's-eyes darted around the corridor, ensuring no wandering ears could overhear their conversation, before she finally spoke with measured calculation. "Have you reached a decision yet?Will you join forces with me, or shall we remain adversaries?"

Millie found herself puzzled by the cryptic statement. "Collaborate on what specific endeavor?"

"You truly haven't devoted any consideration to this matter?" Vivian's laughter carried sharp edges of contempt, though she swiftly suppressed her rising fury upon remembering her underlying agenda."Allow me to refresh your memory-Millie still stands between you and Charles like an insurmountable wall. If you genuinely desire advancement, you must orchestrate Millie's downfall. Without that,you'll never ascend to become Charles's official girlfriend."

With that revelation, Millie finally comprehended what Vivian was proposing.

"Your proposal holds zero appeal for me,"she responded with unwavering finality.

Having delivered her verdict, Millie pivoted toward the exit with determined purpose.

Yet Vivian materialized directly in her path, transforming herself into an immovable human barricade.

"If you lack enthusiasm for that particular arrangement, what about today's upcoming competition?"Vivian's expression transformed into one of supreme confidence, a knowing smile playing across her lips.

Millie remained silent, her gaze fixed intently on Vivian while she waited for the explanation to unfold.
"You understand perfectly well that your live performance quality had been screwed twicealready.These remaining contestants are seasoned professionals, not inexperienced amateurs, and your off-stage voting statistics will inevitably fall short. Since off-stage votes constitute a substantial portion of the final scoring system, you're already operating from a position of significant disadvantage.Furthermore, several individuals in today's audience maintain loyalty to my interests, and I myself make scoring decisions as one of the judges," Vivian declared with calculated precision.

She advanced closer, her eyes boring into the masked figure who stood before her with steadfast resolve. "Therefore, Serena, do you comprehend the situation now? Whether you advance or face elimination today rests entirely within my control."

Millie studied Vivian's face and suddenly perceived the entire situation as utterly absurd.

Hadn't Vivian proclaimed her desperate desire to spend her remaining six months in peaceful harmony with Brandon? Millie had already released her claim on Brandon and allowed him to pursue his relationship with Vivian, so what purpose did Vivian's current machinations serve?

Millie genuinely could not comprehend the logic behind these actions.

Though she harbored a personal dislike for Vivian, she had never actively pursued opportunities to sabotage or harm her. When dealing with someone battling such a terminal illness, she perceived no justification in exacerbating their suffering.

Yet now, Vivian was deliberately forcing this confrontation upon her.

Processing these thoughts, Millie responded with calm resolve, "Proceed however you see fit.I remain completely uninterested in your proposals."

Millie refused to accept the role of a passive victim. She had simply been awaiting the appropriate moment to assert herself. Now that circumstances had shifted favorably in her direction, she felt no inclination to restrain herself any longer.

She began maneuvering around Vivian's obstructive position.

"Are you absolutely certain you have thoroughly considered the consequences of this decision?" Vivian struggled to accept that Millie was still rejecting her proposal outright. "If you refuse to cooperate with my terms, you'll face elimination in this very round. That outcome means you will become worthless to Charles, and you will never achieve superiorityover Millie."
Millie released a genuine laugh. "Should I interpret that as a direct threat? Or does this represent just another one of your manipulative power games?"

"If labeling it in those terms provides you with comfort, then certainly," Vivian replied with icy indifference.

As though the situation could truly be reduced to such simplistic terms. Millie found Vivian's blatant hypocrisy absolutely astounding.

Rather than dignifying Vivian's posturing with additional verbal sparring, Millie simply stepped around her adversary and continued toward her intended destination.

"Serena!" Vivian's voice rang out behind her, but Millie maintained her steady pace without so much as a backward glance and walked directly out of the corridor.

Vivian could only remain frozen in place, watching Millie's retreating figure disappear, her jaw muscles clenched so tightly that sharp pain shot through her temples.

She despised this infuriating woman with every fiber of her being.

She possessed undeniable leverage over Serena, yet the masked contestant remained frustratingly indifferent to every threat and manipulation.

If she didn't require someone to execute her underhanded schemes at this moment, she would have orchestrated Serena's destruction ages ago.

"You will come crawling back to me on your hands and knees one day," Vivian whispered through gritted teeth, her words dripping with promised retribution. "Just wait until you're truly desperate and hanging by a thread."

She still retained the powerful option to resurrect an eliminated contestant from the competition, and she found herself anticipating the moment when Serena would grovel and plead for her intervention.

Embracing this satisfying thought, Vivian finally allowed her tense muscles to relax, curved her lips into a triumphant smile, and glided out through the staff corridor with renewed confidence.

After both women had departed from the corridor, two shadowy figures began conversing in hushed tones within a cramped, dimly lit surveillance room.
"Our boss truly possesses an extraordinary instinct for explosive drama. This footage will generate massive headlines!"

"During our last assignment, when the boss instructed us to maintain surveillance on Brandon's wife,we stumbled upon that incredible scene of a child addressing her as 'mom'-that single shot netted us a substantial fortune!"

"This ammunition will prove devastatingly effective for extorting substantial payments from Vivian.She'll hemorrhage cash to keep this buried!"

"Absolutely correct. This behavior contradicts her carefully crafted public persona completely. If she refuses our demands, her sterling reputation will crumble into worthless dust!"


.··

While everyone harbored their own sinister machinations and hidden agendas, the third live show commenced with great fanfare.

The trinity of judges assumed their elevated positions one by one, each movement choreographed for maximum dramatic impact.

The charismatic host emerged into the blazing spotlight, delivering polished introductions for each distinguished panel member, who responded with carefully rehearsed pleasantries.

Soon, the spotlight shifted to illuminate Vivian's moment of prominence.

One could argue that this particular season of Heavenly Melody had achieved such unprecedented widespread attention largely through Vivian's magnetic presence and star power.

Backstage, Millie stood in perfect stillness, her sharp gaze fixed intently upon Vivian's commanding performance on the illuminated stage.

She clutched her phone firmly, methodically reviewing a private group chat that tracked everyone's assigned tasks and responsibilities for the evening's live broadcast.

Everyone had completed their preparations with thoroughness and dedication.

"How swiftly time passes by us. This evening already marks the third electrifying live stage for our beloved Heavenly Melody competition," Vivian declared with a radiant smile, her presence absolutely
luminous beneath the stage lights.

"At this moment, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to every single audience member who has remained steadfast in their support, accompanying me through this incredible journey of discovery and artistic growth."

Vivian's smile deepened with apparent sincerity as the live camera smoothly panned across the audience to capture Brandon's supportive face among the crowd.

The crowd exploded into thunderous applause that reverberated throughout the entire venue.

Standing within earshot, Barbara offered her astute observation, "Mr. Watson has maintained his attendance for all three live shows without missing a single performance. He must genuinely harbor deep affection and concern for Vivian's success."

Millie remained perfectly still, her expression carved from marble as she absorbed the spectacle with detached composure.

After the enthusiastic cheers gradually subsided into expectant silence, the camera swept away and then captured the Elliott brothers seated among the sea of faces.

"The Elliott brothers have graced us with their presence as well!" Barbara exclaimed with genuine surprise. "Isn't Myron famously elusive? Yet here he stands, having attended two performances already."

Millie's brow furrowed slightly as she recalled Jayceon's unbridled excitement when he had requested an and autograph during their previous encounter. "Their bond appears unshakeable. Perhaps he's simply here to champion his younger brother's endeavors."

Barbara's head bobbed in understanding agreement. "That reasoning holds perfect sense."

The camera continued its sweeping journey, capturing devoted audience members brandishing handmade signs bearing Vivian's name in bold, colorful letters.

Millie's eyes narrowed into calculating slits as recognition dawned-these were undoubtedly the very people Vivian had spoken of, the ones capable of manipulating the live voting results through sheer vocal force.

In harsh reality, live audiences rarely maintained complete objectivity in their judgments. Most attendees inevitably developed personal favorites and preferences. That fundamental reason explained why online voting carried significantly heavierweight in the final scoring calculations.
Nothing inherently flawed existed within the established scoring system itself.
However,Millie had consistently found herself swimming upstream against the current because of her feed's inferior production values, which paled in comparison to her competitors' polished presentations.

Fortunately, the first two competitive rounds had served primarily as introductory showcases and had not resulted in massive contestant eliminations, which allowed Millie to successfully advance through those preliminary stages.

Yet given the carefully orchestrated circumstances surrounding this particular round, Vivian's behind-the-scenes manipulation had become glaringly transparent and undeniable.
This round,however, would unfold according to an entirely different script.

"Thank you from the depths of my heart," Vivian whispered, pressing delicate fingertips beneath her glistening eyes before gracefully lowering herself into her designated seat.

With that carefully choreographed moment of sentiment, the competition officially commenced with renewed intensity.

Contestants took the stage one after another, each determined to etch their mark into the evening's memory.

The stakes had escalated dramatically-five souls would face elimination while one fortunate performer would earn resurrection, driving every participant to pour their entire essence into their fleeting moment under the blazing lights.

At long last, fate called Millie's name.

Adorned in a breathtaking mermaid gown that caught and scattered light like captured starlight, Millie glided onto the stage with measured, hypnotic grace.
###Chapter 81 Deep Sea Mermaid
"As our next performance, Serena brings us the song 'Deep Sea'," the host's voice rang out as the lights on stage began to dim.

Slowly, the sapphire lights came to life, casting their glow on a woman in the center of the stage. She wore a deep-blue mermaid-style dress, its fishtail cut flowing around her feet. Her waist was narrow,her arms soft and bare, and the glitter on her skin caught the lights. A half-face mask laced with tiny gems to imitate scales clung to her face, adding just the right amount of mystery to her beauty.

It took no more than a second for every eye in the room to lock on her.

Vivian's eyes locked on the woman on stage. She was certain her carefully planted trap was about to snap shut.

The room hushed. The setting was spellbinding. For many in the audience, it was ther first time witnessing something like this in person, and the atmosphere left them breathless.

Brandon sat up slightly, his brows knitting again. That strange, unshakable feeling of familiarity crept back over him.

Outside, the livestream played on countless screens.

At first glance, nothing stood out-the mermaid-themed set looked plain, even a bit cheap. Under the lighting, it resembled a toy display, plastic and overdone.

But then the image flickered and something changed. What had looked plain and forgettable bloomed into something arresting.

Some viewers, mid-sip, paused as they realized what had happened. The stage, just moments ago boring, had come alive-its texture rich, the lighting softer, deeper,almost liquid.

What had once looked dull now shimmered in sharp focus.

The mermaid's dress, its scaled fabric kissed by blue light, gleamed like ocean waves under moonlight -each glint casting Serena not as a performer, but as something mythical.
And just like that, she held the room in the palm of her hand.

At their laptops, Seville and Alexia were practically glowing.

"Charles pulled it off!"

"I thought we were done for-but this is just perfect!"

"We're finally taking control!"

"Time to shut those people up for good!"

"Millie is everything!"

Their excitement spilled over, laughter filling the room-unaware that Sheridan stood quietly nearby,listening with an amused smile.

Backstage, Vivian checked the stream. Her expression faltered, barely for a second, but she quickly put her mask of composure back on. She excused herself to the restroom and, once out of sight of the cameras, pulled out her phone and called Oakley.

He answered quickly.

"What's going on?" she snapped. "Didn't we have this locked down? Why does the livestream look better?"

"Maybe it hasn't kicked in yet. I'Il take care of it," Oakley said, trying to stay calm.

"Don't forget what you promised," she said coldly. "If Serena slips through your fingers, Charles will be harder to deal with."

"I get it," Oakley said, trying to stay calm.

But it was already too late. Oakley wouldn't be the one to fix this, not now.

Charles was posted at the door of the control room, arms crossed, a smug smirk playing on his lips.Around him, a few subdued saboteurs sat slumped, surrounded by his team.

From a distance, Oakley approached, unaware that the game had already slipped out of his hands.

Behind the scenes, a quiet battle was unfolding, hidden from the watching crowd.
Meanwhile, the livestream continued without disruption.

Serena began to sing. Her voice, gentle and low, wove itself through the ocean sounds and lighting effects that surrounded her. With each note, the stage felt like it was sinking deeper underwater.

The story she sang wasn't the familiar one of a mermaid giving up everything for love.

This version belonged to a girl of the sea with eyes set on the land-not just for the prince, but for the world beyond.

The prince was not the reason. He was simply part of the journey. Loving the prince and walking away from him were both her own choices.

She wasn't a woman led around by heartbreak. She knew how to hold on and how to let go. Always growing, always changing, but never losing herself.

As her voice moved from soft longing to strength and clarity, the story changed-from a girl caught in love to a woman exploring a world far bigger than romance. Then, just as naturally, it all returned to the sea. Blue lights rippled across the stage. The hem of her gown danced gently in the air, mimicking a fishtail weaving through the ocean.

The melody climbed higher, each note lifting the audience with it.

The livestream chat lit up with messages pouring in.

"Oh my God, this is stunning!"

"I can't take my eyes off the screen-her voice, her dress, the stage, everything!"

"Is that really Serena? I used to thik she was only good with lyrics. Her stage presence tonight is unreal!"

"She looks beautiful. This whole look is next level."

"And her styling-perfect with the theme. Her makeup and hairstyle fits so well!"

"I saw her at a previous show. Her live performances have always been solid, but strangely, the stream and sound quality didn't do her justice. I said it before, and no one listened. It felt so annoying."

That last comment,apparently from someone in the audience, was flooded with likes.
"Yeah,the video changed all of a sudden-like someone flipped a switch."

"Exactly. Barely a second or two in, and boom. What was dull and grainy turned crisp and stunning,just like that."

"People watching live, you're lucky. This is a whole experience."

"Trust me, being there in person is even better."


···

The Internet buzzed wvith excitement, while behind the screens, Seville and Alexia coordinated every move,carefully amplifying the buzz online.

At the Heavenly Melody live show, Vivian couldn't stop staring at the screen. The masked woman was already halfway into her song, and still, the broadcast refused to slip back into that poor resolution she had counted on.

Her frustration boiled over, and she dialed Oakley again.

He didn't answer right away.

When he finally picked up, she snapped, "What took so long? What's going on? The show's already halfway gone, and the stream's still crystal clear!"

On his end, Oakley stood tense, glaring at Charles from a distance.

His men had already been captured.

Heavenly Melody had multiple hands in it-production houses, talent agencies, investors. That made everything sensitive, and Charles knew he needed to thread carefully. Charles, even though known for his short temper, wasn't the reckless type to lash out without thinking.

He knew that reckless action could trigger a chain of consequences that would echo far beyond the night. He was just the third grandson in the Evans line. With more episodes of Heavenly Melody still in the pipeline and multiple powerful players watching from the sidelines, Charles had done the math. He had read the room, struck the right deals, and quietly won the nod of every key investor.

So when Oakley tried to smooth things over with vague words and fake calm, Charles simply raised his fist and hit him."You thought the temper was for show?" Charles asked coldly.
Because Charles hadn't acted aggressive earlier but instead kept his calm, Oakley had been careless and come alone. No backup. And now he was outnumbered.
He seethed more as Vivian's name lit up his screen.
"I'm dealing with it," he said curtly and hung up without waiting for her reply.
"Oakley, what are you-" Vivian's voice crackled, but the line was already dead, leaving her fuming.
Back on stage, the masked mermaid kept singing, her voice rising even higher. Every eye stayed fixed on her with amazement.
###Chapter 82 The Counterattack
The stage lights danced in perfect harmony with Serena's ethereal voice, transforming her mermaid-like silhouette into a mesmerizing aquatic dreamscape that enveloped the entire audience.

Meanwhile,fury coursed through Vivian's veins like molten lava.

She contemplated reaching out to Oakley, convinced that sabotaging the audio quality would serve as her most effective weapon. Her knowledge of Serena whispered warnings that even greater spectacles awaited the audience.

Yet Oakley remained frustratingly unreachable, either deliberately ignoring her desperate attempts or drowning in his own web of complications.

Exhaling a defeated breath, Vivian pivoted her strategy and decided to contact Johnny instead,her fingers moving with urgent precision.

The live broadcast continued its relentless march forward, igniting passionate debates that spread like wildfire across the digital landscape.

Without warning, a provocative question surfaced from the chaos. "Have mysterious puppet masters orchestrated the dramatic transformation in Serena's video quality?"

This accusation unleashed a devastatingstorm of suspicion, since the stark improvement had blazed obviously to every watching eye.

"She stumbled through those first two broadcasts like an amateur, but now she's suddenly transformed into this polished performer. Something reeks of deception here."

"Did anyone else catch this pattern? Serena consistently dominates the live audience votes while her online ratings plummet into obscurity. The Internet crowd sees through facades, but those present fall for every trick."

"What if they secretly boosted Serena's technical production values for this particular performance?"

"If that revelation proves accurate, it's absolutely revolting. A manipulated talent competition becomes nothing more than an elaborate farce!"
These critical voices gained tremendous momentum, drowning out any opposing viewpoints beneath their overwhelming chorus of condemnation.

Across the digital battlefield, Seville and Alexia recognized their golden moment had finally arrived.

"The time has come," Seville declared, his fingers flying across the keyboard with practiced precision."Prepare yourself; we're unleashing our devastating counteroffensive immediately!"

They had spent hours lurking in the shadows, carefully hoarding their ammunition for this decisive final assault.

Millie had previously shared her tactical wisdom with them, dissecting every move Vivian's PR team might attempt while presenting multiple strategic pathways. This particular approach had emerged as their chosen weapon, supported by carefully crafted contingency plans.

Just as the accusations against Serena reached their peak intensity, a video exploded across social media bearing the tantalizing title "Exclusive Phone Recording of Serena's 'Yesterday' Live Performance."

The footage immediately triggered an online earthquake.

"Sweet heaven, my friends who witnessed the live show kept raving about Serena's brilliance, but l never imagined she could be this absolutely breathtaking! The visual feast is spectacular, and that violin solo sent electric shivers cascading down my spine!"

"Remember,someone captured this using basic phone equipment, not sophisticated professional gear.Can you imagine how transcendent the actual audio experience must have been?!"

"For everyone who missed the live event, I stood in that audience, and I can guarantee with absolute certainty that Serena earned every single vote she received!"

"I witnessed it firsthand too, though I kept silent before now. This recording reveals Serena's true audio and video brilliance. I'm convinced someone deliberately sabotaged her earlier performances."

The arguments erupted with renewed fury.

Then another explosive video materialized from the depths of cyberspace, titled "Exclusive Phone Recording of Serena's 'Us' Live Performance."
This second release struck even deeper emotional chords. While "Yesterday" had mesmerized viewers with its theatrical spectacle and haunting violin magic,"∪S"pierced straight through to the heart.

The light rock melody, masterfully woven with threads of melancholy, painted a story so vivid it seemed to breathe with life.

Every viewer sat paralyzed in wonder.

Both revelations had launched within thirty seconds of each other-a coordinated strike designed for maximum impact.

Back at the Heavenly Melody live venue, Vivian witnessed her carefully constructed plans crumbling into dust, her entire body trembling with uncontrollable fury.

On stage, Serena glided gracefully into the climactic final verses of her mesmerizing performance.

The melody began its breathtaking ascent, carrying her voice from whispered intimacy to celestial magnificence, spiraling upward like an ancient prayer ascending to the heavens.

Her vocal cords stretched beyond mortal limitations without fracturing, leaving behind only an overwhelming sensation of otherworldly purity.

The song approached its finale as the melody struck a stunning G6, sweeping the audience forward like an unstoppable ocean wave, painting the vision of their mermaid finally claiming her throne as sovereign of the depths.

Profound silence descended upon the venue like a sacred shroud.

Every soul present remained frozen in reverent wonder.

Nearly thirty seconds passed before thunderous applause crashed through the stillness.

Millie surveyed the sea of enraptured faces before her, and then bent forward in a graceful bow that acknowledged their collective appreciation.

This masterpiece had consumed weeks of meticulous preparation, crafted specifically for this pivotal moment.

The instant Alexia had successfully obtained Tia's phone, Millie recognized that destiny had finally arrived.
The time had come to flip the script entirely, and this composition possessed all the necessary elements to accomplish that monumental task.

Her mind raced with strategic calculations about reaching the online audience with maximum impact.

High notes-those spine-tingling vocal peaks that defied human limitation-represented the most powerful method to demonstrate the dramatic difference.

This composition masterfully blended emotional storytelling with technical virtuosity, shattering through the deliberate suppression that had plagued her previous two performances.

Even if Charles encountered unexpected technical disasters, her undeniable skill would shine through regardless, piercing even the most degraded broadcast quality.

She had constructed every element to be absolutely bulletproof.

Millie rose from her bow with regal dignity, and became acutely aware of an intense scrutiny burning into her consciousness.

Her eyes swept the crowd until they locked onto Brandon's familiar silhouette, seated among the mesmerized spectators.

Those brief, transformative minutes had somehow shaken Brandon to his very core.

Watching the enigmatic masked performer on stage, his vision kept superimposing Millie's face over the mysterious figure.

The haunting melody and embedded story triggered cascading memories of Millie's expressions,their shared precious moments, and that recent painful encounter when she had firmly rejected his advances.

Something fundamental had shifted within Millie's essence, though he remained frustratingly unable to identify the exact nature of that transformation.

The performance reached its conclusion as applause erupted around him, and he found himself joining the ovation despite his confusion.

Though he understood rationally that the masked woman represented Charles' romantic partner rather than Millie, he couldn't suppress his admiration for her extraordinary skill and raw talent.
Close beside him, Jayceon erupted into wild celebration, his enthusiasm infectious and unbridled."Myron, did your ears capture that absolute magic? Sweet mercy, this performance transcended phenomenal! Thank the stars we decided to attend this particular show. Live audio delivers such richness that no recording could ever capture. Every second proved absolutely worthwhile!"

Next to him, Myron-who had endured Jayceon's excited shaking throughout the entire performance-applauded enthusiastically while nodding his complete agreement.

By the time the final notes faded into memory, every person in attendance, with the notable exception of seething Vivian, found themselves overwhelmed with nothing but pure, unadulterated admiration.

Millie allowed her gaze to linger briefly on Brandon before deliberately looking away, catching sight of Barbara positioned at the stage's periphery, who was nodding and clapping with unmistakable enthusiasm-a clear signal of Charles' triumphant success.

Every intricate piece of their elaborate strategy had fallen perfectly into place, creating a symphony of coordination.

The performance concluded with flawless precision as Millie gracefully retreated from the spotlight.

Charles rushed toward her with obvious excitement radiating from every step.

"How did everything unfold on your end?" Millie inquired, her smile radiating quiet satisfaction.

"Beyond magnificent!" Charles erupted with joyful laughter, still riding the high from his earlier confrontation with Oakley that had left him feeling gloriously vindicated. He carefully steadied Millie's elaborate dress while supporting her arm. "Every aspect remains completely under our control."

Charles glowed with immense pride, knowing he and Millie had orchestrated this stunning victory as true partners.

"From this point forward, success depends entirely on our company's marketing specialists, working in perfect coordination with Seville and Alexia's efforts," Millie explained with quiet confidence.

They shared a meaningful smile that spoke volumes, their understanding transcending the need for additional words.

Meanwhile, Brandon observed them from his distant vantage point, experiencing an unexpected surge of jealousy that caught him completely off guard.
###Chapter 83 The Truth Comes Out
Side by side, Millie and Charles slipped behind the scenes.

While they moved through the narrow staff hallway, Vivian's silhouette caught their attention near the wall.

Something in her expression had shifted-nervous energy had replaced her usual calm.

"You've been dodging my invitations for a reason, haven't you?" Vivian's gaze fixed on Millie. "Turns out you had this all mapped out from the beginning."

A small, cool smile played on Millie's lips. "Plans or no plans, I never cared much for your proposals."

Charles gave Vivian a glance, barely able to stifle his amusement.

Realization dawned on him-Millie's choice to wwear a mask on stage now struck him as sheer brilliance.

Ironically, Vivian had tried to outsmart Millie and ended up trapping herself.

Still, he managed to hold back his laughter, remembering he had to keep up appearances as Serena's backer.

Keeping a straight face proved almost impossible for him.

With a quick cough to steady himself, he furrowed hisbrow and acted confused. "What's all this about? We should get moving."

Catching his cue, Millie met his eyes, gave a quick nod, and fell in step beside Charles.

They wasted no time leaving the hallway, while Vivian could only watch, so flustered she stamped her foot on the floor.

Soon, she barely had a moment to dwell on the duo, as her phone buzzed with an urgent message from Johnny.

A fresh announcement had just appeared on Evans Entertainment's official page.
What lay ahead was more than a simple showdown onstage; the real contest was only now coming to life.

Beyond the stage lights, a storm of public opinion was about to take shape.

Once back in the lounge, Millie, Charles, and Barbara found their spots behind a makeshift divider.

Every hand flew across keyboards, linking up with their allies online, working in perfect sync.

Just then, Evans Entertainment dropped two pristine videos for all to see-live performances of Yesterday and Us.

An official statement ran alongside. "Earlier technical issues impacted Serena's live broadcast. After much coordination, we're including updated performance footage in the upcoming Heavenly Melody special."

Unlike the shaky phone clips, these videos boasted flawless audio and visuals.

No detail on stage went unnoticed, and the entire production looked more dazzling than ever.

This rollout had been carefully mapped out by Millie and her team as the most effective approach.

While official footage would sway some, unfiltered phone recordings had their own crucial role.

Vivian's side was bound to claim everything was orchestrated by money and influence, so dropping only polished videos would never silence those doubts.

Instead, the plan was simple-let raw phone clips make the rounds and soke conversation. Only after public debate reached its peak would the official account step in with high-definition videos, laying bare the truth behind the earlier efforts to suppress Serena.

Once Millie caught a glimpse of Tia's video, she began mapping out the perfect timing for both the song and footage release, making sure the phone clips hit with even more force.

Meanwhile, Charles took care of Oakley, ensuring nothing more could throw a wrench in their plans.

Social media lit up, flooded with reactions and heated debate.

Evans Entertainment tried to play it safe, issuing a polished statement about "technical issues" to gloss over the controversy.
People couldn't help but wonder why every contestant's show had gone smoothly, except for Serena's performance.

Questions started popping up. "Funny how the glitch only hit Serena's set, isn't it?"

One commenter chimed in, "Honestly, I didn't want to believe it at first-why sabotage your own talent?But this explains a lot."

Another added, "Exactly. Forget the official uploads-the raw phone clips, even with awful angles and old cameras, were still rock-solid. If nothing else, that proves there really was some problem on Serena's stage."

"From what I saw, the rest of today's show was flawless. Just a hiccup at the beginning, but they fixed it right away."

"Nearly missed out on a powerhouse singer because of all this!"

Someone else added, "I was right there in the crowd. Every time | tried to comment, my words vanished.I kept getting muted."

"Same here. I'd watch Serena's live performance, but the versions floating around looked off. When I posted about it, nobody answered. Eventually, I figured out my posts were invisible to everyone but me."

Little by little, more audience members came forward, all with the same burning question.

They wanted answers. "Who's behind this mess?"

Whispers and theories began racing across every corner of the Internet.

Initially, fingers pointed at Serena's fellow contestants, but a pattern quickly emerged-she'd been singled out since the very first round. Stories circulated about her missing rehearsals because of an injury, and supposedly, no one else had access to her stage setup. Besides, as someone signed to Evans Entertainment, it made little sense for rival companies to sabotage her performance.

Memory served the crowd well: Serena's rendition of Yesterday nearly stole the spotlight, only to end up neck-and-neck with Vivian's Glimmer of Love in the audience polls.

That observation kicked off a whole new round of online sleuthing.
"Is it possible Vivian had a hand in this?"

"Now that it's out there, all the puzzle pieces start to fit," someone commented.

"Who else could pull this off so easily? Let's not forget, she's got Brandon in her corner."

"The margin between Glimmer of Love and Yesterday was razor thin."

"Exactly. Without the glitch, I bet the two wouldn't have been locked in a tie-Serena's performance was obviously way much better. I recall people mentioning Vivian didn't even have a professional background, and with Serena's performance looked awful in the clips, they said Vivian was the true winner."

"Rumor has it, before that opening night, Vivian's crew was seen pulling aside other contestants for some quiet conversations."

"Can anyone confirm if that actually happened?"

"Nobody really knows-just gossip for now. Still, you have to admit the stage setup improved a lot for the later shows!"

"That's a fact."

Before long, the Internet's attention landed directly on Vivian.

Vivian, caught off guard, began firing off frantic texts to Johnny, searching for a way out.

For a while, she disappeared entirely from the live broadcast.

Her unexplained absence only fanned the flames of suspicion.

Nothing could be done; it wasn't like she could ring Johnny for advice while cameras were rolling.

Grinding her teeth, Vivian sent a sharp glare toward the door of Serena's lounge.

Taking a breath, she reminded herself, saying, "This isn't the moment for payback. Clean up this mess first-then go after her."

Determined, she called Oakley once more.

Meanwhile, inside Millie's lounge, she and Charles watched as Seville and Alexia coordinated smoothly
with Evans Entertainment's PR team, tilting the odds in their favor. The two shared a glance, both pleased with their progress.

Relief finally settled in. They leaned back against the couch, tension easing.

Charles broke the silence. "What drives her to go so far? She already has everything she wanted,doesn't she?"

Millie frowned, just as confused. "Your guess is as good as mine."

A thought struck her, and she asked, "Hey, do you have anyone you know working over there? Whose words carry weight?"

"Where exactly do you mean?" Charles replied.

Millie quietly typed out "Flaville" on her phone and showed it to him.

He gave his head a little shake. "Not at the moment, but I have friends who might do. I can make some calls.What's up?"

Waving off the question, Millie said, "It's nothing urgent. Go ahead and reach out, though. There are a few things I'd like to find out."
###Chapter 84 It Was All Serena's Fault!
The live show was still ongoing, but the Internet was already buzzing.

Heavenly Melody had become a sensation, drawing a wave of attention.

The live stream audience was just a fraction. Many who missed it watched the edited clips instead.Serena had made a strong impression in the first round, but her second-round performance felt underwhelming.

Now, thanks to the trending clips released by Evans Entertainment's official website, the views were skyrocketing.

If the live stream sparked the first wave of attention, this was the second-wider, louder, and far more explosive.

Most people didn't have the time to sit through full live broadcasts, so the edited versions became their go-to.

The more views poured in, the louder the chatter grew.

"Oh my goodness, this is amazing!"

"Yeah, I've been watching the edited versions. Everyone stepped up in round two. I thought they were holding back in the first round, letting her shine. Didn't realize it was the audio and video quality messing things up."

"In the second round, her song didn't focus on showing off singing technique like the others did. Plus the tampered quality, she looked pretty average."

"I only voted for her because of her songwriting. I gave my other votes elsewhere. Honestly,I regret it now!"

"So who's behind this? I don't buy the 'technical issues' excuse. I mean, why is she the only victim?Someone needs to dig deeper!"

"Exactly. This has to be looked into properly!"
Vivian's side was instantly flooded with criticism.

People began questioning her, demanding answers.

Vivian was caught off guard.

Thankfully, she used the live broadcast as an excuse to delay her response and buy time.

Meanwhile, at the apartment, Seville and Alexia were celebrating.

"Hahaha, this is so satisfying! I can finally breathe again!" Seville jumped to his feet. "Everyone was attacking me before.Look at them now-apologizing!"

"Yeah, some even posted screenshots of your old comments. It's hilarious," Alexia said with a nod.

Seville was surprised that people had acted so fast to save those comments before they were deleted.

Now,they had become proof.

"But I'm sure most of the ones insulting me before aren't the same ones defending me now," Seville said, narrowing his eyes.

Alexia laughed. "Still, clearing your name is what matters."

"Absolutely!" Seville broke into a goofy anime-style celebration dance in the living room.

He might've been chubby and a bit of a homebody, but he moved with surprising agility.

Alexia burst out laughing beside him.

Unseen by them, Sheridan, sitting in another chair, smiled quietly.

At the Heavenly Melody live show venue...

Inside Millie's private room, Charles looked pleased as things started swinging in their favor.

But Millie stayed calm. She quietly watched Vivian return to her seat on the live stream screen.

Vivian's return meant only one thing-she had a counterplan.
Now, it was time to see her next move.

Vivian's PR team wasn't one to take lightly.

Sure enough, a new narrative soon began to spread online.

"Why is everyone blaming Vivian? She's not even a contestant!"

"Exactly. She's just a judge. Maybe people are barking up the wrong tree."

"They say Vivian used Brandon's influence to target Serena, but think about it-if she really had that power, Serena would've been erased without a trace by now."

"Someone else is behind this, and they're trying to frame Vivian."

The argument was clever, flipping the logic in Vivian's favor.

To the average viewer, it sounded reasonable.

Meanwhile,Seville and Alexia stayed active, pushing out responses and listing their points.

It was all part of a well-planned strategy. Slowly, public opinion started tilting back.

After all, besides Vivian, no one else had a reason to target Serena.

And that was the truth.

Then,professionals from the music industry joined in, analyzing Serena's performances and praising her talent.

The online buzz only grew louder.

Vivian saw it all-and her jaw clenched in frustration.

Since Johnny's team started working with her, she had never taken such a hit.

Even handling Millie had been a walk in the park. But now Serena-this nobody-was proving to be a real thorn in her side.

Still, Vivian couldn't let her frustration show on camera. She signaled the crew not to film her and quickly lowered her head to text Oakley and Johnny.
Oakley ignored her completely. He had his own mess to deal with.

Johnny suggested they leak Serena's scandals-like her secret relationship with Charles and her miscarriage-to distract the public.

Vivian refused. "That's my ace. I need to keep it for leverage. Besides, now that the audio tampering is almost confirmed, using that info would backfire. Netizens will think we're slandering her out of spite.We'd lose the advantage and risk a backlash."

Johnny agreed-but there was nothing more he could do for now.

"I need to clear my name and steady my public image first," Vivian typed back quickly. "I'll come up with something. Wait for my message," she added after thinking it through.

Vivian glanced toward Serena's lounge, her eyes filled with hatred.

Then she reopened Oakley's chat-but still no reply.

Frustrated, she got up and stepped into the staff corridor to call Eugene.

It didn't take long before Eugene answered.

"Miss Simpson?" his voice came through.

"Eugene, I need your help. I don't know if you've seen what's going on online," Vivian said weakly.

Eugene confirmed he had.

"I honestly don't know who's behind this. But now, everything's being pinned on me. Doesn't the Watson Group have ties to the entertainment industry? You might know some people. Could you give me a hand?" she asked in a low,pitiful voice.

Before now, Vivian had only used Brandon's name as a shield, relying entirely on Johnny's team. This was the first time she'd ever directly asked Watson Group for help.

Getting the Watson Group involved meant more complications. Once tied to them, she wouldn't have the freedom she used to. She also risked some of her secrets coming to light.

But now, she had no choice.
And it was all because of Serena. Vivian believed Serena was the reason that she had been pushed this far.
###Chapter 85 Vivian's Desperation
Vivian expected Eugene to agree immediately, but to her surprise,he hesitated.

"Miss Simpson, I can't promise anything. You'll need to speak to Mr. Watson directly. Without his instruction, I can't make this decision," Eugene said, his voice steady.

He hadn't reached his position by being reckless.

that so? I understand. Sorry to trouble you," Vivian replied with a soft smile, though she was seething inside.

Once she married Brandon, she would make sure Eugene got replaced immediately.

For the first time in a long while, she felt like she was hitting a wall at every turn.

With no other option, she walked over to Brandon.

"Brandon," she said hesitantly.

Brandon looked at her and gave a small nod, signaling her to speak.

Vivian leaned in close and whispered in his ear.

"Please, Brandon," she said, her tone pleading. "This is actually about a family feud within the Evans family. Oakley and Charles had a fight. I saw Oakley backstage, and things were heated. But the public doesn't know better, so they're blaming me."

Her eyes turned red with emotion. "I'm not afraid of rumors. I just don't want all my efforts to be misunderstood. I've never had much time left, and all I want is to leave behind something good. If I'm wrongly accused, everything I've done will be stained. You know that's not what I want."

She cleverly shifted the blame onto Oakley.

Brandon looked at her quietly. His feelings were complicated.

He knew about the feud between the Evans brothers.
Vivian had also spoken to him before about why she wanted to join the show.

But as she spoke, Millie's face suddenly appeared in his mind.

The Watson Group didn't even have an entertainment arm-until Millie.

That department had been created just for her, even though she was signed with Evans Entertainment.

It eventually grew to support other artists, but the biggest share of resources always went to Millie.

She knew it too, but she insisted on honoring her contract with Evans Entertainment and never once asked to break it.

After marrying Brandon, she quietly stepped away from music and never brought it up again.

Vivian noticed Brandon's silence and kept her pitiful expression in place.

"If you don't want to, it's fine," she said with a forced smile.

Brandon finally looked away.

Maybe it was time to let go.

Millie had changed. She didn't need those thing he built for her anymore.

He sighed. "Tell Eugene it's from me," Brandon said at last.

"Really? Thank you, Brandon!" Vivian's face lit up, and she rushed to call Eugene.

But Brandon didn't look at her again.

Something made him raisehis head and'glance down the corridor.

There,he saw Serena standing quietly,watching him.

Charles then stepped out from the shadows and gently draped his coat over her shoulders.

He said something to her. Serena looked away, and the two of them walked off together.

Whispers spread: Speculation grew. Public opinion began to shift.

"Vivian has always stayed true to her values. Whether it's Heavenly Melody or her charity work, she just wants to inspire others before her time runs out."

"Exactly! She's almost at the end of her life. Why would she care about pushing Serena down?"

"I heard it's a family feud-Oakley and Charles. This isn't about Vivian."

"Vivian doesn't even have six months left. Blaming her just seems wrong."

"Yeah... It's just too cruel."

Millie scrolled through the comments and smniled.

As expected, Vivian's illness would always win sympathy.

Charles sat beside her, seething.

"What is he even thinking?" he snapped. They both knew who	"he"was. "Should we go with that plan?"

Millie shook her head.

Though they had evidence against Vivian's PR team, the players involved now were from the Watson Group.

That evidence they had wouldn't help much anymore.

"So we're letting her off?" Charles asked through gritted teeth.

Millie laughed. "Not a chance."

"But she-" Charles glanced toward the nearby camera, careful with his words.

"She's desperate now. And it's going to cost her," Millie said calmly.

Charles leaned closer, his eyes lighting up."You mean...?"

Millie lowered her gaze and began typing on her phone beneath the table. "First, Vivian stabbed Oakley in the back. They may still look like allies, but that kind of betrayal leaves a scar. Second, she used the Watson Group's resources. Even if she manages to clear her name, her image is already tainted.People will begin to doubt her. Most importantly, she's panicking. Sympathy only works a few times.Overdo it, and people start getting tired. You can't fake your way through forever. The more she tries to fix this now, the stronger the backlash later. She used the Watson Group because she's desperate.That means the end is close."

Charles nodded quickly as he read her message.

Millie was right.

He was too impatient.

His hot temper had always been a double-edged sword-he got things done, but it brought problems too.He had learned to control it over the years.

And if he wanted to keep up with Millie, he had to master patience.

"Look, we've already won," Millie said with a smile, handing her phone to him.

Though Vivian was no longer under attack like they wished to, good news was that Serena was now swimming in praise.

First came the positive comments. Then well-known influencers began doing reactions on her songs,pointing out the details and difficulty.

Soon, online musicians were trying to replicate herhigh notes in Deep Sea.

The buzz exploded, drawing in even more people.

"Back during the first round, everyone argued over whether Glimmer of Love or Yesterday was better.Now it's clear-Yesterday takes the crown!"

"Right? Vivian's song is beautiful, but she's not a pro. Serena's song is more technical and heartfelt."

"Glimmer of Love is nice, but the live version didn't hit. Not surprising though-Vivian isn't a trained singer."

"Either way, Serena's amazing!"

Just like that, Serena's commercial value skyrocketed overnight.

The live show inched toward its grand finale.

Each singer gave it their all, and with every elimination, fans felt a sense of loss.
The live broadcast that stirred so much passion finally came to an end.

But Millie hadn't expected Vivian to make a fatal mistake at the very last moment.
###Chapter 86 Brandon Begins To Suspect
Eventually, Vivian stepped in front of MAillie again, blocking her path.

"Help me straighten things out," Vivian said in the staff hallway.

Millie couldn't help but find the whole thing ridiculous.

Even now, Vivian still carried herself like she was owed something.

But there was no way Millie would lower herself to stand up for someone like her.

Without a word, she turned to leave.

"Think about it! The odds aren't with me right now, but I know how to make a comeback!" Vivian shouted after her.

She didn't stop there. "Once word gets out about your miscarriage, do you really think you can keep playing high and mighty? You're only doing good now because I've had mercy on you!"

Millie almost laughed out loud.

Vivian was talking about mercy now? Really?

She honestly had no idea where Vivian found the nerve to speak with such confidence.

"Serena!" Vivian called after her again.

Millie didn't bother looking back.

"You think you can cruise your way to the top on this show? Just wait, I'll be right here when you come crawling back!" Vivian yelled.

Afterward, Millie packed her things and got ready to head out. Charles had set up a celebration dinner,and she was going to pick up Ari first. But before she could leave, Vivian created a huge scene.

Just as the audience was calmly filing out, a man suddenly stormed into the recording studio.

This man was the same person who had tried multiple times so far to question Vivian about the demo,
only to be held back every single time.

Vivian was the one who had let him in now.

Millie learned this from her assistant, Barbara.

"He tried getting in several times," Barbara muttered beside her. "Mr. Evans noticed too. I later heard he was looking for Vivian, but she had people keep him out. They say he's some obsessedfan of hers."

Millie arched a brow. She paused her packing, wondering what kind of stunt Vivian was pulling now.Then she saw the man charge toward the stage,brimming with rage.

The live stream equipment hadn't been fully turned off yet, so the audience watching online could still see everything unfold.

Vivian was still on her seat, casually packing up her things.

Suddenly, the man's voice rang out."Vivian!"

Her mic was still live, so his shout echoed through the entire venue.

The audience, who had been making their way out, turned around in confusion.

Even those watching the stream were drawn back by the sudden commotion.

The staff who was moments from ending the stream, froze in place.

"Do you want something?" Vivian looked startled for a second, but then quickly composed herself and smiled at the man.

The man lit up with excitement.

"I'm your fan!" he yelled, wiping the sweat off his brow.

Brandon noticed what was going on and began to walk over, but Vivian's assistant quickly moved in front of him, shaking her head subtly.

He stopped, frowning, unsure what was really going on.

"Oh, I see. Nice to meet you," Vivian said warmly, reaching out her hand. "Thank you for being a supporter."
To the casual observer, it all looked like a spontaneous encounter.

In fact, a number of people in the audience started feeling concerned for Vivian.

When it came to overly obsessed fans, anything could happen. There had already been plenty of similar situations with other celebrities before.

"You don't have to be scared. I'm not here to cause trouble!" the man shouted. "I just wanted to let you know that I'll always be cheering youon!"

Vivian gave a polite smile, tilting her head as if genuinely confused.

"I saw your studio demo of Glimnmer of Love online. It was amazing! I'm honestly blown away by how talented you are!" he went on, his voice rising with emotion. "There's so much rumor about you today,Vivian, but l just want you to know that you're not any less than anyone else!"

Then he added, "Serena is a trained singer. Who knows how many years she's spent honing her voice?But you? You're just a regular person, and still, you can sing like a pro! Honestly, I think the demo of Glimmer of Love sounds just as good as the live performance of Yesterday!"

Vivian looked slightly embarrassed as she said, "Thank you for your support, really... That's very generous of you."

"I'm not making this up!" the man insisted. Then, without missing a beat, he asked what he'd really come for. "So, did you actually sing the demo for Glimmer of Love yourself?"

Vivian looked as if she had no choice but to go along with it. She nodded. "I did."

Up until now, she had always danced around the question, but this time, her answer was clear and direct.

Though many fans online had already assumed she was the voice behind the demo, there was a big difference between speculation and a public confirmation.

The man lit up even more. "I just thought of something! Didn't you say earlier that you'd be working with a film company to produce a mini-series for Glimmer of Love? You should totally include this demo in it!"

"All right, I'll think about it," Vivian responded with a smile.
As the man continued talking excitedly, Millie looked completely in shock.

So that was what Vivian's biting comments had been about, her claim that Millie had no chance of taking first place? She planned to pit the demo version of Glimmer of Love against Yesterday?

But that demo version was recorded by Millie back when she wrote that song.

To make a sale, she had to let people hear how it sounded. So she just did a quick demo, playing and singing it herself.

It was recorded in some random studio at Evans Entertainment.

Millie's eyes turned toward Brandon. She noticed him staring at Vivian with a frown.

Brandon was feeling mixed emotions at this moment.

When Vivian's assistant stopped him earlier, Brandon had started to piece things together. This whole encounter had been staged by Vivian.

He and Vivian knew the truth. Vivian's song was bought from another artist from Evans Entertainment -Eva, and it was Eva who had recorded the original demo.

So what was Vivian trying to do now?

Brandon had never paid much attention to online chatter. Even if he wanted to, he simply didn't have the time. His schedule was packed, and rumors about him popped up constantly. He didn't spend his days glued to a phone screen. That was what the PR team was for. His secretary, Eugene, only informed him when something truly needed his attention.

So at this moment, he had no clue what kind of games Vivian had been playing lately.

For the first time though, Brandon realized that Vivian wasn't quite the person he had believed her to be.

Pondering on this, he pressed his lips together.

He was now waiting for Vivian to come forward and explain everything.

Millie noticed the change in Brandon's demeanor but chose not to say anything.
Meanwhile, Barbara's view of Vivian had also changed completely. "I used to think she was pretty decent, and talented too. But now, it looks like she really is-"

It was clear that Vivian's move was designed to crush the competition and secure the top spot in the first round.

Barbara shook her head, at a loss for words. To her, the whole thing felt cold and calculated.

Just then, Charles walked over and gently draped a coat over Millie's shoulders.

He caught part of Barbara's comment and gave a faint smile. "We insiders know the truth, but the people online have no clue. As we speak, they're still praising her."

Barbara was stunned. She quickly pulled out her phone to check and sure enough, he was right.

The Internet was flooded with admiration for Vivian's grace under pressure. Even when a superfan had rushed the stage, she'd simply smiled and shaken his hand.

Now, her supporters were all over the demo of Glimmer of Love, holding it up in comparison to Yesterday.

Many online were now saying Vivian's "less-than-perfect" performance during the earlier live show had only been due to illness, and that Glimmer of Love was every bit as good as Yesterday.

Millie didn't respond to any of it. She just walked out with Charles.

Not long after, Brandon and Vivian also left the venue.

Inside the Bentley, Brandon cast a glance at Vivian as she scrolled through her phone.

Then,his voice broke the silence. "What's going on with the demo?"
###Chapter 87 Scandalous Affair
A hesitant grin flickered across Vivian's face as she looked up.

"I just had to do it, Brandon," she admitted.

Without a word, Brandon regarded her, lines of concern deepening across his forehead.

Vivian explained, "The public already links 'Glimmer of Love' to me.If I don't claim the demo as mine, it puts everything at risk."

He gave no reply, his expression showing only skepticism.

Trying again, she added, "That fan has been showing up for every live broadcast. Go ahead and check if you don't believe me, Brandon. Even if I shut him out again this round, he's not going to give up-he'll get in one way or another. Remember, we bought that song from Eva for a staggering sum. Usually,even a top composer gets only one million, but you handed her ten, Brandon. That covered everything."

Though she poured out her reasoning, Brandon kept his gaze locked on her, unmoved.

An uneasy silence settled in the car.

Neither looked away.

At last, Vivian exhaled, her shoulders drooping. "Some choices just have to be made, Brandon."

Barely above a whisper, she added, "I don't have much time left. If I want to achieve anything, this is the only way. Shouldn't the end justify the means, if what I'm doing is for the greater good?"

A moment's hesitation lingered before Vivian lifted her head, forcing a smile."Isn't that Millie's approach too?"

Brandon said nothing, lips pressed into a thin line as he regarded Vivian, noticing the redness building in her eyes.

Tears welled up as Vivian whispered, "So Millie gets away with it, but I'm not allowed to? Is that what this is, Brandon-do you just favor her?"
Instead of answering, Brandon shifted his focus to the window, turning away from her completely.

Night had already fallen, and the world outside blurred by, bathed in the weak glow of passing streetlights.

All the while, Brandon's mind argued that Millie was different.

Compassion shaped her actions toward others. When Millie was unyielding, it was only with herself.

A sudden tension gripped his temples, and Brandon realized a headache was brewing.

Still, with only half a year left for Vivian, he could hardly bring himself to judge her choices too harshly.

Vivian's gaze stayed fixed on his profile, her mind working behind searching eyes.

She needed to come out on top right from the start; it was the only way to show that, even as a newcomer, she could leave the professionals in her shadow.

Winning wasn't just about the trophy for Vivian; her real aim was to outshine Millie completely.

Letting Serena take center stage would rob her of any chance to prove herself.

Victory in that opening round became nonnegotiable-Vivian simply had to come out on top.

Meanwhile, the Bentley cut through traffic while MMillie had already scooped up Ari.

The elaborate mermaid makeup had vanished. Now Millie strolled through an aisle of art supplies, Ari's small hand clasped in hers.

Ari's passion for drawing had been the spark-Millie purchased one of her paintings, and a deep connection blossomed from there.

"Miss Bennett, do you think I could have these?" asked Ari, pointing shyly to a bundle of new paintbrushes.

Millie crouched down to meet her gaze, brushing a stray strand from Ari's forehead."Ari,you never need to be shy with me. Whatever your heart wants, I'll make sure you have it."

Ari's eyes sparkled with happiness, savoring the reassurance.

Even so, she stayed mindful, selecting only the art tools she truly needed, not wanting to be wasteful.
Observing this gentle restraint, Millie felt her fondness for Ari grow even deeper.

Behind Ari's cheerful exterior, there was a challenge-she had VSD, a congenital heart defect.

Seeking answers, Millie had taken Ari to visit Alexia, where she learned that it wasn't fatal, and with surgery and diligent care, Ari could live a healthy life.

Despite this, Ari's parents had given up on her, leaving scars of insecurity and a fear of being unwanted.

No matter what happened, Millie would treat Ari as though she were her own daughter, determined to help her rise above any obstacle.

With the bill settled, Millie kept a gentle grip on Ari's hand as they stepped into the night.

A leisurely walk followed, Ari bursting into laughter as she recounted amusing tales from her days at kindergarten, their sharedjoy echoing down the block.

Just then, a Bentley sped past them, its polished body glinting under the city lights.

Hidden behind the tinted glass, Brandon couldn't help but notice the easy happiness on Milie's and Ari's faces, an unexpected warmth stirring inside him.


...

Not long after, Millie found herself at the entrance of the private room Charles had booked for their gathering.

Inside, Seville,Alexia, and Sheridan had already arrived, waiting while Charles was still on the way.

The door opened and Millie entered with Ari nestled in her arms, promnpting Alexia to cross the room with a bright smnile.

"Look who it is-Ari!" Alexia beamed, presenting a gift. "You remember me, don't you?"

With a sweet voice, Ari replied, "Alexia," though she hesitated before accepting the present, her eyes flicking to Millie for approval.

Millie gave a reassuring nod, and Ari's face lit up as she hugged the big-eared dog plushie close."Thank you, Alexia," she said,joy sparkling in her eyes.
Unable to resist, Alexia reached out and gently pinched Ari's cheek, adoration plain on her face.

A soft, affectionate smile brightened Millie's face as well.

Chairs slid back and everyone found their places around the table.

While they waited for Charles to arrive, Alexia leaned in and said, "I've already spoken with a few doctors. The sooner we start Ari'stests, the better. Once everything's filed, we'll be ready to schedule her surgery."

Because Ari's adoption procedures weren't yet done completely, Millie had to wait until she could sign Ari's surgery consent form as a legal guardian. Still, they could start getting ready for that day.

Millie acknowledged the update, her voice sincere. "Thank you, Alexia."

Waving it off, Alexia replied with an easy grin,"Don't mention it. I'll make sure Giffard takes the lead on the surgery. His skills are second to none."

Turning to Ari, she added a gentle reassurance. "There's nothing to worry about, sweetheart. Once this is over, you'll be running and playing like every other kid."

Although the thought of surgery made Ari a little uneasy, she gave a brave nod, resolve shining in her eyes.

No matter how dauntig it seemed, she would face whatever pain came her way-she wanted nothing more than to belong.

Unable to resist, Millie wrapped Ari in another hug, her own heart swelling with emotion.

Just then, Charles breezed in with a cheerful, "I'm here!" and gave a nod to the wait staff to start serving.

He hadn't come empty-handed either; another thoughtful gift found its way to Ari's side. The little girl had truly won everyone over.

Joy and warmth filled the room, turning their gathering into something truly special.

While they enjoyed their dinner, every corner of the Internet seemed alive with conversation about Serena.
From her chart-topping tracks to every stage she graced, she remained the center of everyone's fascination.

Social media feeds overflowed with videos-countless vloggers chose her music as the soundtrack for their content.

Attempts to cover her songs popped up everywhere; a handful nailed the melodies and earned applause, while others stumbled but found only encouragement, since everyone was there for the fun.

Curiosity only grew as fans speculated about who Serena really was.

"That mask is hiding something. Maybe she's actually a celebrity in disguise?"

"How long before she finally reveals her face? I need to know!"

"I'm dying of suspense, too!"

While talk of Serena dominated the online world, breaking news suddenly took over the trending feed-a headline blared: "Scandal Alert! Millie and Charles Caught Together Repeatedly, Sparks Fly Between the Two."
###Chapter 88 Millie, What's The Meaning Of This
News of the "scandalous affair" barely had time to settle before Brandon issued instructions to Eugene.

"Reach out to Evans Entertainment. Track down Eva and see about drafting a new contract. The payment can be negotiated," Brandon said, voice cool and steady.

Vivian had boldly claimed Eva's song as her own creation, and though he disagreed with how things had played out, the fallout still had to be managed.

After relaying his orders, Brandon found his mind drifting back to Millie.

He wondered, almost involuntarily, how she might have approached such a problem.

A faint shake of his head dismissed the idea.

Millie, he knew, would never have allowed herself to get trapped in such a scandal-matters like these wouldn't have fazed her in the slightest.

A fleeting image flashed in his mind: Millie's laughter as she strolled with that little girl,her happiness obvious even behind a mask.

Moments like that felt like a distant memory-when was the last time he'd seen her look so content?

With chaos swirling around him, Brandon pressed his fingers to his temples, trying to quell the ache starting behind his eyes.

Just then, Eugene hurried into the room, urgency clear in his steps.

"Mr. Watson, there's been a development regarding Mrs. Watson.." he said, hesitating only briefly before offering the tablet for Brandon to see.

There was nothing more Eugene could do; the situation had slipped beyond his control.

Brandon reached for the tablet, eyes scanning a series of snapshots-Millie laughing with Charles as they moved in and out of the Evans Entertainment offices.
Photo after photo captured Charles stopping by the hospital during the days Millie was admitted,making his presence impossible to ignore.

One of the latest updates was a brief video-Millie, carrying a young girl with her face artfully blurred,disappeared into a private dining suite. Not long after, Charles followed behind, his arms full of children's gifts.

A bold headline screamed from the top of the post-"Brandon Watson Duped? Millie's Disappeared for Weeks,Only to Emerge in an Intimate Family Scene with Charles Evans!"

"Bang!" A thunderous crash echoed as Brandon slammed the tablet down with all his might.

Alarm shot through Eugene's voice. "Mr. Watson! Please-"

Anger surged inside Brandon, boiling over.

A moment earlier, he'd pictured Millie's laughter and warmth with that child, imagining her content.Had all that joy really come from her time with Charles?

Wasn't Giffard's involvement already enough-now Charles was part of it too?

Charles, of all people. Didn't he have Serena in his life already?

What possible reason did he have for weaving himself so tightly into Millie's world?

"Give me the location,"Brandon instructed, eyes fixed on Eugene and meaning the restaurant from the latest viral video.

Eugene,always efficient, handed over the address without delay.

Car keys in hand, Brandon wasted no time-he was out the door and gone from the Watson Group building in an instant.

Behind the scenes, it was Vivian who had set this whole leak in motion.

Stirring up Brandon wasn't her main objective. Instead, she believed the real challenge lay in reining Serena in.

Serena seemed to never care about the personal drama between Charles and Millie, so Vivian's real aim was to push her buttons.
Vivian felt certain that, once Serena caught wind of these trending rumors, her anger toward Millie would flare.

On top of that, Vivian saw the scandal as a timely diversion-for herself and for Serena's next performance. If Millie's so-called"affair" was all anyone talked about, it would conveniently shift the spotlight, even if Brandon happened to get caught up in the mess.

That consequence hardly mattered to her.

Eva's catalog didn't concern Vivian either. Since Heavenly Melody first aired, Evans Entertainment had only managed to send a single legal warning, and nothing had come of it.

To her, that silence meant they were unwilling to fight-so settling things privately, if it came to that would be easy enough.

After all, Vivian knew she held something over Serena that others didn't.

In her mind, Charles' feelings for Serena far outweighed anyloyalty he might have had to Eva.

Back at the restaurant, the news had already reached everyone in the private room.

Alexia's temper flared. "What kind of story are they spinning? Are we invisible? It was a big group dinner, yet they made it look like an intimate date between you two?"

A gentle squeeze from Millie steadied Alexia's hand.

"Paparazzi thrive on this sort of drama. Don't let it get to you," Millie murmured, and then smiled softly at Ari. "Are you finished eating? I have to deal with something, so would it be okay if Alexia takes you back later?"

Because the adoption procedures weren't yet finalized, Ari still needed to return to the warfare center before bedtime.

With a small, thoughtful nod, Ari turned her eyes to Alexia for reassurance.

Catching the look, Alexia immediately understood. A quick word with Millie later, she gently gathered Ari into her arms.

The meal was almost finished anyway, so Millie and Charles took the lead, slipping out first to attract any lingering attention. That way, Alexia and the others could exit quietly after the coast was clear.
With the exit swarming with cameras, Millie made no effort to hide her face as she climbed into the car beside Charles, giving the photographers exactly what they wanted.

Any misunderstandings about her relationship with Charles could be sorted out later, since the truth was simple-it had been a dinner with friends, not some secret lover involving only them and a child.

Her status as an Evans Entertainment employee made her visit completely reasonable, and Charles'hospital visits could easily be explained as friendly concern.

All Millie wanted was to protect Ari from the circus outside.

Not long after their car disappeared into traffic, Brandon's Aston Martin tore past them, engine roaring.

By the time Brandon stormed into the private dining room, he found only empty chairs and a couple of servers clearing the table.

Alexia had already whisked Ari away to another part of the restaurant, making sure nothing would go wrong.

Only the cleaning crew remained for Brandon to question.

"Where did they go?" he asked, his tone ice-cold.

The waiter gave him a puzzled look. "They finished eating and left, sir."

It couldn't have been more obvious.

A surge of frustration made Brandon's jaw clench and his hands curl into fists.

Checking his phone for updates, he was greeted with the latest headline."Millie and Charles Spotted Departing Together."

Photos circulating online even captured his own Aston Martin, and now a crowd was beginning to form outside the restaurant.

Anger simmering, Brandon strode away, thumbing Millie's number into his phone.

Only the automated message greeted him-"The number you've dialed is currently unavailable..."

Reaching his car, he slipped through the gathering throng, but his calls continued to go unanswered.
His irritation mounted as he fired up the engine and drove out of the parking lot.

Down the boulevard, his phone stayed glued to his hand, Millie's number dialed again and again.

No matter how many times he tried, her silence held firm.

Blood pounding in his ears, Brandon stomped the brakes in frustration.

He sent a message, asking,"Millie, what's the meaning of this?"

But her reply never came.

He typed again. "Tell me what's going on between you and Charles. I deserve to know."

Nothing. Not a single word.

He shot off another message. "Is it because I've been spending time with Vivian? Are you trying to get back at me?"

Every plea was met with silence.

"Bang!" In a fit of rage, Brandon pounded his fist against the wheel.

"Honk-" A sharp blast from the horn split the quiet night.

Defeat pressed down on him, leaving him with a hollow sense that nothing he did could change the outcome.

He despised feeling so powerless.

After a moment, he steadied his breath, swung the car around, and made for Serenity Villa-the place he and Millie called home after they got married.
###Chapter 89 The Empty House
As Brandon's car wound its way up the hill toward Serenity Villa, Millie's thumb flicked through a barrage of phone notifications.

An uneasy note crept into Charles' voice, "Could this stir up any trouble for you?"

Personal risk hardly fazed him. Years at the helm of an entertainment company had thickened his skin against gossip, and bachelorhood gave him little to lose.

Still, the court of public opinion reserved its harshest judgments for women. Millie's name could be dragged through the mud on nothing more than whispers, even though they both knew they had nothing to hide.

Still, Charles couldn't honestly say his feelings for her were strictly business. Yet he carried himself with restraint. He recognized the lines that should not be crossed and always kept his distance.

From the hospital to Evans Entertainment and even at social functions, they never let their relationship drift beyond the space shared by colleagues and friends.

Millie gave a little shake of her head, unconcerned.

"No big deal. I'll handle it with a statement," she murmured, already typing away.

A calmness settled over her. In contrast to her straightforward partnership with Charles, the messy entanglement between Brandon and Vivian was something else entirely.

No point in delving into that now. Instead, she set her phone aside and said, "It won't matter soon anyway.Brandon and I will have our divorce finalized in a few days."

Call after call from Brandon had lit up her screen, along with a flood of unanswered texts.

None of it surprised her; it was exactly why she'd silenced his every call.

Full disconnection wasn't an option, not with legal loose ends and Bennett family business still unresolved. For now, he stayed in her contacts,if only for convenience.

There was no sense in sparking a confrontation before the divorce became official.
She made up her mind to stay quiet and out of sight until the papers were finally signed.

With that, Millie focused her attention on polishing her statement.

A sidelong glance from Charles lingered on her profile before he spoke again, hesitance in every word.

"What happens if he backs out?" he asked quietly. "Before the divorce is finalized, either of you could still stop it from happening."

Her eyes flicked over the post one final time before she pressed"publish."

"He won't." A steady confidence colored her voice as she turned to watch the world blur by outside."Vivian's running out of time. If Brandon wants to fulfill her last wish, divorce is the only way forward."

Beyond the glass, the street glimmered with the leftover confetti, a silent echo of some other couple's new beginning.

The truth struck her; she and Brandon had barely made it through a single year as husband and wife.

Memories of that whirlwind wedding still lingered, bright and fresh.

Back then,Crobert had been transformed, every inch draped in white roses and gleaming with luxury.

The dress she wore was worth a fortune.

Brandon had orchestrated the whole affair, pouring his energy into every rushed detail, determined to make it flawless for her.

She could still picture the way he lifted her into his arms, promising her a lifetime of love.

She still remember that look in his eyes, sincere, almost reverent.

Yet less than twelve months had passed before he shattered that trust.

What did it matter now? Millie forced herself to look away.

Seven years of love couldn't be reclaimed, but once she accepted the truth, she resolved never to dwell in regret.

With a small, determined smile, Millie glanced at Charles. "Anyway, I have proof of his affair. Even if he tries to call it off, I can still make the divorce happen."
A sigh slipped from Charles as he met her steady gaze, quietly admiring her resilience.

Strength like hers was both admirable and heartbreaking to witness.


...

Elsewhere, an Aston Martin cruised toward Serenity Villa.

Mid-drive, Brandon's phone buzzed with a sharp notification.

A quick glance during a stoplight told him it was from Millie's social feed, a special alert he never ignored.

One tap opened her post.

Millie's statement was direct and unflinching. "There is no truth to the recent rumors about Charles and me.Our friendship goes back years, and I was once an artist at Evans Entertainment. Our relationship has always remained professional and cordial. Other friends attended that dinner tonight as well; it was never just the two of us and a child. I kindly ask the media to stop circulating misinformation."

The traffic signal flickered to green.

With a sigh, Brandon locked his screen and guided the car forward.

No part of that public statement settled his nerves. The explanation rang hollow, and if he couldn't believe it, neither would anyone else.

Annoyance simmered beneath the surface.

Lately, Millie had grown distant, and he couldn't shake the sense that she was hiding something.

The urge to confront her grew with every mile.

Memories from their last argument at Moonlit Estate resurfaced: her tears, the way she had pushed him away.

Doubt gnawed at him. Had she turned cold because there was someone new in her life?

He recalled the years she had clung to him, always yielding to his wishes, even when she was worn out,his soft words could always change her mind.
She had never rejected him, not until that night.

Was Charles the reason for her change? Or maybe it was Giffard, or someone else he hadn't even considered?

Brandon's fingers curled tighteraround the steering wheel, knuckles going stiff with pressure.

The sleek Aston Martin eased up the driveway and stopped at Serenity Villa.

Pulling up to the driveway, Brandon stepped out and made his way to the front door.

Complete darkness greeted him as he entered. Not a single lamp had been left burning.

A frown creased his forehead, echoing a sense of deja vu. This wasn't the first time he'd come home to a house like this.

He flipped every light switch in reach, chasing away the shadows, but silence echoed through every room.

A chill crept in. Something felt fundamentally different.

He remembered his last visit, a quick trip to grab something before visiting his grandfather, when the darkness hadn't troubled him. Tonight, though, the emptiness was impossible to ignore.

Jaw set, Brandon moved toward the master bedroom.

There was no sign of Millie. Not even the faintest trace.

Nothing about the place suggested anyone had been living there recently.

A deeper scowl etched itself across Brandon's face.

Maybe she'd simply switched rooms, maybe she hadn't gone far.

With a surge of hope, he began opening doors throughout the house.

Room after room revealed the same story-bare surfaces, untouched sheets, not a trace of daily life.

Refusing to give in, Brandon made his way to the bathroom, searching for any sign she'd been there.Only his toiletries remained.
Two toothbrushes once stood side by side; now, his was the only one left, upright and lonely in its holder.

She was gone.

No matter how he tried to deny it, reality was staring him down.

His steps led him back to the master bedroom, eyes falling on the closet, now half-empty and forlorn.

There was a time when the space had held clothes belonging to them both.

Part of it held his things, the rest held hers.

Now, only his neatly pressed suits hung in rigid rows, untouched by anything warm or familiar.

Every detail pointed to one thing-Millie hadn't lived here for quite some time.

A year ago, unless Millie was on a trip, staying at Moonlit Estate, or with him in his other houses, she always returned to this place.

She had confided once that, after losing her father, she never really belonged anywhere.

Years spent being pulled from place to place by her mother, and then watching her remarry, left her more lost than before. Even after her stepfather's departure, the tension at home never eased.

She used to call this place her sanctuary, a real home, something she'd promised to hold onto, even when he was away.

No matter the hour, she would always leave a light on for him, always ready to welcome him back.

Each new piece of furniture, every little detail she'd added, had filled the house with warmth and comfort. But now, those things remained but traces of her had vanished, casting a cold, sterile chill over the rooms.

Brandon's hands curled into trembling fists.

A silent ache settled in his chest, heavy and inescapable.

Had she really moved on for good? Or was this some new test, another twist in her pattern of leaving and returning?
###Chapter 90 I Can't Add You
Brandon sat on the edge of the bed, his thoughts tangled and heavy

Nothing made sense anymore.

The more he tried to understand, the more everything slipped further out of his grasp.

He unlocked his phone and called Eugene.

"Find out when Millie last came to Serenity Villa," he said, voice low. "Ask the cleaning staff. I need to know how long it's been."

Eugene promptly sprang into action.

Not long after, Brandon's phone buzzed with a message. "Mr. Watson, it's a bit tricky. I've asked the cleaning staff to speak with you directly."

A call came through seconds later.

Brandon answered.

"Hello, Mr. Watson," the voice said quickly, "I'm the cleaner from Serenity Villa."

"You're the one in charge of cleaning the place, right?" Brandon asked, getting straight to the point."Tell me-when exactly did my wife move out?"

The cleaner paused to think before answering. "I'm not entirely sure about the exact date, but | think it's been about twenty days."

Twenty days.

That was right around the time they'd gone to file for divorce.

After a few more quick questions, Brandon ended the call.

He set the phone down beside him and slowly lay back on the bed, staring up at the blank, off-white ceiling.
Twenty days.

Had it really been that long?

In just a few more days, they'd be handed their final divorce papers.

It felt unreal. Divorce had always been something distant-never something that applied to him and Millie.

Was this truly what Millie wanted? To walk away from everything they had?

Brandon lay there in silence, thoughts circling in his mind. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't make sense of it.

This couldn't be it. Not really.

Seven years. They had been together for seven years. And through it all, her love had been steady.

He had seen her passion-genuine and unwavering-reflected in her gaze more times than he could count.

And more than that, she had always cared deeply about the Bennett family's remaining business. She used to say it was her father's legacy, something she'd been a part of since childhood. She had worked tirelessly, managing those businesses now under the Watson Group like they were her own.

Through everything, she hadn't brought up the Bennett family's business, not once.

If she truly intended to walk away, she would have taken it with her.

That thought brought Brandon a small wave of relief.

Maybe she wasn't leaving after all. Maybe she was just angry-hurt.

Once she learned the truth behind everything, she would understand.

He just needed time. Six more months, and everything would be in place.

After that, he would treat her the way she deserved.

Still, there was one matter he knew he couldn't ignore any longer. He had to talk to her about Charles.
The night slipped by in silence.

By late April, the weather had begun to soften, and spring showers came more frequently.

That night, the rain had poured down relentlessly, but by morning, the skies had cleared just in time.

Millie held Ari's hand as they walked toward the kindergarten gate, the ground still damp beneath their feet.

She crouched down, kissed Ari on the cheek, and smiled. "I'll pick you up this afternoon," she said gently. "Alexia helped us make a hospital appointment, so after school, we'll go for your check-up.Sound good?"

Ari nodded cheerfully and returned the kiss with a soft giggle, her innocence making Millie's heart swell.

Millie pulled her into one last hug before letting go. With her tiny backpack bouncing behind her, Ari walked into the school building, and Millie watched her go, a soft smile lingering on her lips.

The previous night, Millie had gone to see Rita for a follow-up, and the news had been reassuring-her condition was steadily improving.

Deep down, she could feel it too.

Since Ari had come into her life, something within her had started to heal.

Each day, the shadows of her past grew fainter. She believed that by choosing to move forward and leaving behind what once broke her, she was slowly finding herself again.

With that thought steadying her, Millie turned away and headed toward Alex's place.

There were still things to take care of today.

More importantly, she needed to start preparing for the semifinals of Heavenly Melody.

Time passed quietly, swallowed by the day's demands.

When Brandon stirred from sleep, the clock had already slipped past noon.

He reached for his phone instinctively, but aside from routine notifications and meaningless updates,
there was nothing from Millie. Not a single word.

Despite the messages he had sent and the calls he had made, the silence remained unbroken-as if she had disappeared into thin air.

He had spent the night alone in the master bedroom at Serenity Villa. Even after pouring himself a few drinks, the emptiness of the house had crept in like a cold wind, making it impossible to rest.

For a fleeting moment, a strange thought crossed his mind-was this what it felt like to be the husband left behind? Alone in a big, empty house?

Brandon sat up and shook his head, brushing the thought away. "Ridiculous," he thought.

Brandon.headed to the study to catch up on the morning's work. A stack of unfinished tasks waited for him,along with several messages from Vivian that he replied to without much thought.

When he finally looked up from the screen, it was already late afternoon.

His thoughts drifted back to Millie. He had to find her. But she wasn't answering his calls or texts.She wasn't at Serenity Villa either. Where else could she be?

Then it clicked-Ari.

Millie always picked her up from kindergarten in the afternoon. That was his only lead.

Without wasting another moment, Brandon requested the address of the kindergarten and drove straight there in his Maybach, arriving just before dismissal.

He hadh't planned on doing anything-just waiting quietly for Millie. But as he scanned the schoolyard,he spotted a little girl sitting alone on a low stone bench near a tree. It was Ari.

She was focused, a crayon in hand, sketching on a piece of paper in her lap. Brandon hesitated. Then,after a moment's thought, he walked over and sat on the bench next to her.

Curious, he leaned slightly to look at her drawing.

It was simple, childlike-full of soft colors and uneven lines.

A tall figure with long hair held hands with a smaller child.
Ari was now carefully writing a word beside the tall figure, each letter slow and wobbly. Mom.

Brandon's heart ached quietly. She was drawing herself and Millie.

But as he stared at the picture, something about it felt incomplete-like someone was missing from the scene.

He looked up-and found Ari watching him.

Her big round eyes blinked curiously at the man sitting beside her.

"Mister, she asked in a bright, innocent voice, "are you waiting here for your child, too?"

Mister.

Not "Dad." She called Millie "Mom," but she didn't know who he was.

Brandon opened his mouth, instinctively wanting to correct her. But then he stopped.

Millie hadn't told Ari about him. So what right did he have to say anything?

He forced a soft smile, choosing a gentler response instead.he said."|just want to watch you draw."

"You're doing a really good job," Brandon added quietly, looking down at her picture again.

Ari looked up with a cheerful smile and pointed at the taller figure in her drawing. "This one's my mommy," she said proudly. "Isn't she the prettiest?"

Brandon nodded with a soft smile. "She is. Very pretty."

Ari beamed. "I think so too! My mom's the most beautiful lady in the whole wide world."

Her joy was pure and contagious. Brandon couldn't help but smile along.

Yes, she was right-Millie truly was beautiful.

After a quiet moment, Brandon glanced back at the drawing."Hey,"he said gently, "can I ask you something?"

Ari blinked up at him,curious.
He pointed to the blank space beside the two figures. "Do you think... maybe you could draw me in here? Standing next to you and your mom?"
Ari looked down at her drawing, clutching it tightly. Then she shook her head. "No, I can't,"she said simply. "This picture is just for me and Mom."
Brandon's smile faltered a little, but he tried to keep his tone light. "What if I buy you some ice cream?Would that change your mind?"

But Ari shook her head again, more firmly this time. "Mommy said I'm not allowed to eat ice cream."Then she added seriously, "And I'm not supposed to take things from strangers."
Brandon opened his mouth to say something, but she continued before he could speak."Ifyou want a drawing," she said earnestly, "you should ask your own kid to draw one for you."
She looked at him now with cautious eyes, as if she was starting to wonder if she should be talking to him at all.

Brandon blinked, caught off guard.
Her innocent words cut deeper than anything else could have.
###Chapter 91 Her Injuries
Brandon almost told Ari the truth about who he was, but in the end, he held back.

He was here today for one reason only: to clear things up with Millie about Charles.

He didn't want complications. That was the plan.

Brandon caught the flicker of fear in Ari's wide eyes, her gaze dartingaround as if searching for an escape route. Before she could bolt, he quickly said, "Don't be scared. I'm not a bad person."

Still, it was obvious she didn't want to stay.

"I used to have a child," Brandon said, the words slipping out before he could stop them. An image flashed through his mind-Millie, soaked in blood and sobbing in his arms. "But they're gone now.Seeing you just... reminds me of that."

"I didn't mean to scare you," he added gently."1only asked you to include me in the drawing because of that."

Something must have shifted, because Ari stopped fidgeting. She looked up at him with surprising seriousness, no longer on the verge of running.

Then,with a quiet kind of grace, she reached out and patted the back of his hand.

Her tiny hand on his felt soft. It was very comforting.

Brandon almost chuckled.

A little girl comforting him? But the strange thing was, it worked. He actually felt a bit better.

Then she spoke. "But | still can't draw you in. I have my rules."

Rules? What did such a small child know about rules?

Brandon raised an eyebrow, more intrigued than annoyed.

"Did your mom teach you that?" he asked.
Ari turned back to her drawing, carefully filling in the colors. Without looking up, she replied,"My mom taught me a lot."

"But you haven't known her long, have you?" Brandon asked.

Ari didn't seem to mind the question. "She's nice to everyone. Not just me-Charles, Alexia too."

Her face lit up. "Even though I don't call her 'Mom' out loud yet, she gets me. She takes me to the doctor, buys me things, lets me go to school."

But then her expression tightened with concern. "She doesn't take care of herself, though. Her injuries aren't better yet. But I kiss them, and she says it helps. My mom says when I kiss her booboos, they stop hurting."

Brandon's thoughts immediately jumped to Millie...

Her head was wrapped in bandages when he saw her at the hospital last time.

She'd fallen down the stairs. He wondered how bad her injuries were.

During their recent visit to the Moonlit Estate, he hadn't gotten a chance to check on her.

A light breeze passed as he watched Ari color with impressive focus.

Brandon found a quiet sense of peace settling over him.

This,he thought, was nice.

Time drifted by. Then, in the distance, he spotted Millie approaching the kindergarten

Without thinking, he stepped back into the shade.

As soon as Millie entered the school yard, she spotted Ari perched on a stone bench, completely absorbed in her drawing.

Just seeing her brought a smile to Millie's face.

She walked over quietly, not wanting to interrupt. But Ari noticed her anyway.

"Millie!" she squealed joyfully, running straight into her arms.
Millie caught her with practiced ease.

"I just finished a drawing!" Ari said eagerly,holding it out. "Do you like it?"

Millie took the paper and examined it with a warm smile. "It's beautiful, Ari. You did a wonderful job."

She kissed Ari on the cheek, making the girl giggle.

Carefully, Millie rolled up the drawing and set it aside. She then sat beside Ari, gently brushing her fingers over Ari's forehead and cradling her small hands in hers.

She pulled out a wet wipe, cleaning Ari's face and fingers, and then opened a thermos and poured her some warm water, using the lid as a temporary cup.

Her every motion was thoughtful and tender.

"Thank you," Ari said after finishing her drink, passing back the lid with both hands.

"You're welcome. Want some more?"

Ari nodded, and Millie poured another cup.

As she helped Ari retie her loosened ponytail and adjust her shoelaces, she asked how her day at kindergarten had been.

Ari had plenty to say. They both seemed to be enjoying the moment.

From a distance, Brandon watched quietly.

If he and Millie had a chid...would their life look something just like this?

Would they walk hand-in-hand as a family of three?

He felt a sudden ache in his chest. Was he getting old, longing for this kind of domestic life?

Then Ari piped up, "Right, a stranger said he wanted to buy me ice cream earlier."

Millie stiffened slightly. "Who was it?"

Ari looked around and then pointed. "He was over there."

Following her gaze, Millie spotted Brandon, no longer hiding.
Their eyes locked. Millie straightened.

Brandon stepped forward, his voice steady. "We need to talk."

Millie turned her attention to Ari, who was still watching them curiously from the stone bench.

"Ari has a hospital appointment," Millie said coolly, making it clear she didn't intend to linger.

"I'Il go with you," Brandon replied, giving her no room to decline. "Unless you want me showing up here every day?"

Her lips pressed into a thin line.

She looked back at Ari. Then, with a resigned sigh, she nodded.

Better to deal with him now than let this drag on.

Ari continued to observe the two adults, her eyes full of questions.

But Millie said nothing.

She didn't want to explain. She didn't want Ari calling Brandon"Dad."

Yes,they were still legally married-but not for much longer.

Without a word, she helped Ari into the back seat of Brandon's Maybach and got in beside her.

The car glided smoothly toward Crobert Hospital.

Silence hung heavy inside.

Brandon glanced at Millie in the rearview mirror.

When had things grown so cold between them?

She used to have that dazzling smile on her face whenever she saw him. Now, she wouldn't even look at him.

He broke the silence. "When did you move out? And why didn't you tell me?"

Millie kept her eyes on Ari, who leaned quietly against her.
"You don't need to know," she replied, her tone calm but distant
Brandon clenched his jaw but held back.
"Where are you staying now?" he asked again.
Still no answer. Millie gently rubbed Ari's back. After a longpause, she finally said, "We'll talk after Ari's hospital appointment."
"Millie!" he started, his voice rising with anger.
Ari suddenly burst into tears. Big, silent sobs that spilled down her cheeks. "He's scary," she cried.Millie's patience snapped upon seeing Ari's tears.
"Stop the car," she said, her voice icy.
###Chapter 92 Don't Push Me Into Hating You
Brandon's harsh tone had already left Ari shaken.

Even as Ari's sobs grew louder and filled the car, Brandon showed no sign of stopping.

"Stop the car!" Millie demanded.

Yet,Brandon pressed on, the vehicle hurtling forward.

"Brandon!"

Finally, she pulled Ari into a comforting embrace, gently stroking her back.

"Ari has a congenital heart condition. A defect she's had since birth," Millie explained, her voice trembling,eyes red-rimmed. "Are you trying to kill her?"

Having already endured the loss of two children, she was resolute: nothing would happen to Ari.

Upon hearing this, Brandon's gaze flickered to the rearview mirror, where he saw Ari truly distraught.

His jaw tightened. He slowly eased his foot off the accelerator, guiding the car to the side of the road.

Catching sight of Millie's tear-filled eyes in the mirror, Brandon's grip on the steering wheel tightened.

Millie said nothing more. She simply unbuckled her seatbelt, scooped Ari into her arms, and stepped out of the car.

Regret washed over her. She should never have succumbed to Brandon's threats and allowed Ar into his car.

Had she stood firm, Ari wouldn't have been subjected to such terror.

"Millie!" Brandon called after her.

Millie ignored him, hailing a taxi and directing the driver to Crobert Hospital.

Brandon, however, wasn't so easily deterred. He shadowed them from a distance.
Watching the Maybach trailing in the taxi's rearview mirror, Millie felt a mix of anger toward Brandon and frustration with herself.

She looked down at Ari, gently patting her back.

"How are you feeling now, Ari? Are you uncomfortable?" Millie asked, her voice laced with concern.

Ari wiped the tears from her cheeks.

"I'm okay," Ari murmured, shaking her head.

"If you feel unwell, you must tell me," Millie urged softly.

Ari nodded and then curled into Millie's embrace, falling silent.

Ari was lost in thought, remembering the past.

Though children's memories often fade quickly, she vividly recalled the fight right before her biological parents abandoned her.

This time, however, was different. Millie was here for her.

Nestled in Millie's arms, Ari felt a sense of security.

The taxi pulled up directly to the hospital entrance.

Giffard was already waiting outside.

The moment he spotted Millie and Ari, he rushed forward.

He also noticed Brandon parking and getting out of his car just behind them.

As Brandon approached, Millie handed Ari to Giffard and then turned to face Brandon alone.

"Millie,"Brandon said, hurrying over, a deep frown etched on his face. "I didn't know Ari had a congenital heart condition."

Millie met his gaze. "Whatever her condition is, you shouldn't be yelling in front of a child."

Brandon offered no argument. They simply stood there, locked in a tense stare.

Since their last encounter, their interactions had always been laced with tension, leaving Brandon
feeling utterly helpless.

A gentle breeze stirred the air. Finally, Brandon broke the silence. "What's really going on between you and Charles?"

Millie closed her eyes, exhaustion washing over her.

"There's nothing between us," she said. "I thought you'd seen the statement online."

Millie knew Eugene would have kept him fully informed.

So why was he here, making things even more difficult for her?

Her stance, she believed, was already abundantly clear-from ignoring his calls and texts to rejecting him outright at Moonlit Estate.

Not far off, Ari refused to leave without Millie.

Millie, unwilling to prolong the argument,turned to leave.

"Wait," Brandon said, reaching out to grab her hand. "I still have questions."

Millie sharply pulled her hand away.

"I told you-I'm only here for Ari's check-up. She needs surgery," Millie said, her voice cold.

But Brandon stepped into her path, blocking the way.

Ari continued to watch.

A dull throb crept into Millie's temples.

"In a few days, I'll be at Babette's wine tasting. If you still have questions, ask me there," she said,locking eyes with him. "Don't push me into hating you."

Then,without waiting for a response, she moved past him and walked over to Ari and Giffard.

Brandon wanted to stop her, to say something-anything--but her words echoed relentlessly in his mind.

He turned to watch them go, his emotions raging within him.
How had things gotten this bad?

Millie could feel his eyes on her.

Whether it was Ari's frequent glances over her shoulder or thefaint tension in the air, Millie knew Brandon was still watching.

She sighed and pushed the thought aside.

Whatever this was, it wouldn't last. Once the divorce papers were finalized, they'd be done-nothing left to tie them together.

Giffard observed them quietly, a swirl of emotions turning in his chest.

He'd seen the gossip about Millie and Charles.

He knew Millie wasn't interested in Charles-not romantically. She never led people on.

But being a man himself, Giffard could tell that Charles definitely had feelings for Millie.

And if he was being honest, a sliver of jealousy had taken root. He secretly hoped he could be by her side like Charles did.

Even so, he wished her happiness.

His gaze shifted to Ari, who had leaned her head against Millie's shoulder. Gently, he said,"Ari,you'll come with me for your check-up now, okay? If anything feels off,just tell me."

Ari turned and looked upo at him with wide, trusting eyes.

"Okay. Thank you," she replied softly.

The check-ups followed.

When the tests were done, Millie took Ari home.

They cooked dinner together, ate, and curled up on the sofa to watch cartoons. Ari love it.

They watched until the sky turned dark. When it was time to send Ari back, the girl seemed hesitant throughout the drive, glancing at Millie over and over.
Millie could see the question forming on her lips.

"What is it, Ari?" Millie asked, parking the car and turning to the girl.

Ari's voice was barely above a whisper. "That man today... who was he? He seemed to know you."

Millie didn't answer right away. She looked into Ari's eyes, so big and earnest.

Outside, a breeze rustled the leaves.

The streetlights cast a soft glow over passersby, their laughter drifting into the stillness of the car. It al felt strangely distant.

Should she tell Ari the truth?

After a moment, she nodded to herself.

Ari would be living with her soon. The past wouldn't stay buried. Besides, Brandon might show up again.

And Ari wasn't like most children-she understood more than people gave her credit for.

So Millie reached for her hand and said, "He's my husband."

Ari blinked in surprise. "But in nine days, we'll be officially divorced," Millie added gently. "You don't have to worry about him."

She smoothed Ari's hair with a quiet sigh. "Sometimes, we make mistakes. He was one of them. But I'm doing my best to make things right, and I promise, he won't be a part of our lives. We're going to be okay."
###Chapter 93 He Only Wants A Child With Millie
Millie drifted into unexpectedly personal territory, her words tumbling out before she could stop them.

She glanced at Ari, a weary sigh echoing inside her chest.

If she was honest, none of this was truly meant for Ari's ears-she was confessing to herself, sorting through the ache she still carried.

Moving on wasn't about erasing the past. It was about stripping it of its power.

Brandon-his memory, his mistakes-no longer held sway over her life.

Nothing he did could touch her now. Or so she desperately hoped.

She almost laughed at the irony of spilling her heart to a child.

Surely Ari couldn't grasp the tangled mess of adult regrets. But before Millie could say more, Ari wrapped her in a fierce, earnest hug, as if determined to shield her from the world.

Ari's tiny arms barely circled Millie's waist, but the embrace radiated a stubborn comfort.

"I'm not going to call him Dad," Ari mumbled in a gentle tone.

"We're both going to be alright," she went on; her voice barely more than a breath."My birth parents didn't want me, but that's just because they weren't the right ones. Finding you-that's the part that matters. You're my real mom now."

Ari lifted her chin, eyes bright with tears but shining with stubborn hope. "When you leave him, you'll find someone better, too. Just like I found you."

Millie blinked, caught off guard by the depth in Ari's words.

Emotion rose in her throat, too fierce to swallow. She pulled Ari into a fierce embrace, clutching her as if to anchor them.both.

Ari hugged her back, small arms locked tight.
In that moment, blood ties meant nothing. It was as if fate itself had stitched their hearts together.

Millie found herself utterly speechless, unable to capture the storm inside her chest. Words simply wouldn't come.

But Ari was right-they would be alright.

No matter how unpredictable life became, every hardship they survived brought them closer to the sunlight on the other side.


···

The wind swept through the night with a biting chill.

In one of the club's private rooms' fading light, Brandon sat curled up, pouring wine down his throat as darkness closed in.

The heavy stillness did nothing to warm the air, nor to soften the ache pounding behind his eyes.

He couldn't stop replaying the look Millie had given him-icy, distant, final. Every time her voice rang out in his mind, it pierced deeper."Don't push me into hating you."

The words spun on an endless loop, refusing to fade.

He lost track of how long he sat there drowning in regret, until the door creaked open and Darden strode quietly inside.

Darden hesitated for a moment, taking in all the empty bottles scattered across the table before quietly closing the door and dropping into the chair beside Brandon.

"Talk to me, man. What's going on?" Darden asked, his tone low with concern. He'd never seen Brandon drink this much ever before.

Brandon only shook his head, searching for words that refused to come.

"Is Vivian's condition getting worse?" Darden queried, his brow furrowed.

Brandon froze.

For a split second, he realized he hardly thought of Vivian the entire day.
His thoughts were consumed entirely by Millie and that little girl.

"If Vivian's sick again, shouldn't you be with her right now?" Darden pressed, thinking he was on the right track after seeing Brandon's reaction.

But Brandon just shook his head, slow and wordless.

Darden's worry deepened, his voice trembling. "Is it that bad? Is she...is she running out of time?"

Brandon shook his head, dismissing the thought. "It's not about hehe said quietly, tipping a steady pour into Darden's glass.

Darden took the drink, offering a relieved half-smile. "Man, you had me worried for a second."

They clinked glasses in the gloom and let the silence settle in around them. Darden sensed the weight pressing on Brandon but chose not to pry any further.

Brandon turned his glass slowly, the liquor catching faint streaks of amber light.

No matter how much he drank, sobriety clung to him.

If anything, the more he drank, the sharper Millie's face etched itself in his mind.

After a long, uneasy pause, Brandon finally broke the silence.,how are things with Alyssa these days?"

Darden blinked, caught off guard. Why did Brandon always circle back to Alyssa during their recent conversations? The focus he put on that relationship was odd, almost obsessive.

Unable to hold it in, Darden leaned forward and demanded to know why.

Brandon absently rolled the ice in his glass, his expression impossible to read.

"Just curious," he answered in an even tone.

In truth,Brandon had no idea why he cared so much.

Maybe watching Darden fumble through his own mess with Alyssa would help Brandon untangle the knots in his own head.

Darden let out a weary sigh, settling deeper into the sofa before downing half his drink.
"Same old story, honestly," he admitted. "Half the time I have no idea what's going on with her anymore. She's been throwing herself into work lately, which came out of nowhere. I mean, for years she was all about shopping and living it up, never gave a damn about anything serious. Now, suddenly,she's all business?"

Brandon shot him a look that made Darden shift uncomfortably, self-conscious under the scrutiny.

"No, wait, that's not how I meant it," Darden stammered, rubbing at his jaw. "She's actually doing something for herself now. I heard she's gotten into secondhand luxury appraisals-guess all those designer handbags I bought her finally came in handy."

Brandon stared into his drink, lost in thought.

What had Millie been doing these days,really?

Three whole weeks had slipped by since they filed for divorce, and aside from the fact that she was working on adopting Ari, he was completely in the dark about her life.

Darden, sensing the tesion had eased, leaned in. "Alright, man. Spill it. What's actually going on with you?"

Brandon took another measured sip, the liquor burning down his throat, and then quietly recounted everything that had unfolded that afternoon.

Darden's eyes widened in sudden realization.

So this wasn't about Vivian at all-everything came back to Millie and that little girl.

Knowing how desperately Brandon had always wanted a child, Darden couldn't say he was shocked.

"Look, you didn't even know she was sick. That's not on you," Darden assured him,clapping him on the shoulder."Just focus on making sure she gets the best treatment now."

From Darden's perspective, Brandon had handled meeting an unrelated child far better than he'd anticipated-especially given how prickly the man could be.

Darden's eyes traveled across the litter of empty bottles.

In all their years of friendship, he'd never seen Brandon like this.
Brandon just sat there, silent.

"If you really want kids, you know adoption is always an option," Darden ventured, trying to sound practical. "Family, close friends-there's always someone who'd be happy to have you step in."

Brandon gave a slow shake of his head,dismissing the idea.

It just wasn't the same.

He couldn't put the reason into words, not even for himself.

The urge ran deeper-a stubborn longing for a child that belonged to him and Millie, no one else.

But then there was Ari. She wasn't his or Millie's by blood, and yet, somehow, Brandon found himself accepting her without hesitation-because Millie had.

The feeling crept in, quiet and unexplainable,as if some invisible thread had tied them together.

When Ari's tiny hand lightly patted his to comfort him, Brandon felt it down to his soul-a jolt of fate he couldn't explain.

For a fleeting moment, an image surfaced in his mind: the deep blue tanzanite stone locked away in his safe,its brilliance secret and untouched.

Somehow,that gemstone and this moment felt bound by the same strange thread of destiny.

Losing his temper with Millie in front of Ari was something he wished he could take back-it stung more than he cared to admit.

Darden broke the silence, lifting his glass to clink against Brandon's with a knowing look. "Come on,don't spiral. Overthinking won't fix anything. You still haven't handled things with Vivian."

His words cut straight to theheart of it as he continued, "Right now, it's smarter to put some space between you and Millie. And the kid, too. I mean, you have Vivian to worry about now, right?"

Darden added, his tone gentler, "Vivian's got maybe half a year left, if that. Just... take it one step at a time."

Brandon pressed his fingers to his temples as another wave of pain rolled through his head.
In the end, he could only manage a silent nod.
He knew what he had to do-deal with Vivian first, beore anything else.
She was running out of time.
Once it was over, he'd finally have the chance to explain everything to Millie.
And in his heart, he trusted that when that moment came,Millie would understand.
###Chapter 94 Treaing Him Like A Stranger
Time flew by. Meanwhile, on the other side of town, Vivian was completely caught up in the situation with Serena and was unaware of everything else that had taken place that day.

By the following day, rumors about Millie and Charles had already spread everywhere, yet there was still no word from Serena.

Did she not know? Or was she simply too ashamed to be the one to reach out first?

Mulling over this, Vivian decided to send a message to Serena's phone.

Millie was driving home after dropping Ari off when her phone vibrated.

She stopped at a red light and glanced at the screen.

It was a message from Serena's number, sent by Vivian. "Have you seen the news trending online? This confirms that I wasn't lying. This is your last chance. Work with me, and I'll support you to the very end."

The streetlight beside her car buzzed faintly as it flickered, casting a wavering glow.

Millie paid Vivian's message no mind and instead opened a different message in her inbox.

It was from Babette, sent some days before.

Millie had been searching for a reason to not attend Babette's wine tasting event.

Something about it gave her a bad feeling, like it would be more trouble than it was worth.

But before she could come up with a solid excuse, Babette had sent her a message.

"You have to be at the wine tasting, Millie. If I were you, I wouldn't miss it. Remember why I come back to the country this time. The Bennett family's old dealings are still tied to the Watson Group. You know what that means."

The streetlight kept flickering, casting shifting shadows throughout the car's interior.
When the light turned green, Millie took her eyes off the screen and continued driving.

There was no escaping the wine tasting now.

Even if it ended up being a setup, she'd still have to face it.

At least if she showed up, she could deal with whatever came her way in the moment.

And besides... Millie's thoughts drifted to Babette.

After spending years with Brandon, Millie had gotten a good read on her.

Babette was driven and full of pride, but she had the knowledge to match her confidence.

They had always stayed out of each other's business, and Millie had no clue what Babette had gone through during her time in Flesta.

If it had anything to do with Millie personally, there were only a handful of possibilities.

A wave of weariness washed over her.

And truthfully, she needed to figure out what to do about Brandon. He was becoming more of a problem than she could handle.

That night,the wind picked up again across Crobert.

The dark sky, the weaving traffic, and the scattered city lights all seemed to move under the weight of something unseen.

Clouds moved swiftly across the sky, as if the night was bracing for something coming.

Time slipped by, and two more days had gone by.

It was now the night of Babette's wine tasting.

The venue was Crobert's most extravagant hotel, reserved entirely for Babette's exclusive event.

To be fair, this setup was already on the casual side.

For a family like the Watsons, events like this were usually held in more private, elite settings like an estate, a luxury villa, a yacht, or some exclusive club.
They use exclusive and elegant venues, tucked away from the public eye. And this kind of high-profile,public affair? Wasn't their typical style.
Millie drove to the hotel and met Brandon at the spot they had agreed on.
As soon as Brandon saw what she was wearing, a subtle frown formed on his face.
It wasn't the dress he had chosen for her.
Millie caught his expression and immediately understood what was running through his mind.
The dress she had on was borrowed from Charles' side.
She had no intention of deepening her ties with Brandon.
Without offering any explanation, she walked into the venue with him.

Inside, the temperature was just right. Soft golden lights bathed the space in a warm glow, giving it an elegant air. Gentle piano music filled the background while formally dressed guests chatted in hushed tones, glasses of wine in hand.
The unmistakable scent of wine lingered in the room, just as one would expect at such an event.
Wherever Brandon went, he was naturally the center of attention. The moment they stepped through the door, all eyes turned toward him.
Reporters quickly got to work, snapping photos and capturing the moment.
Within minutes, headlines like "Millie and Brandon Attend Babette's Party Together" began making the rounds.
Until now, Brandon had only been seen in public with Vivian. It was the first time in days that he'd appeared with his actual partner.
The Internet was buzzing with speculation.
"Wow, it's been a while since we saw those two show up together."
"Wait, what about Vivian? Wasn't Brandon with her all this time?"

"Come on, think about it. This is Babette's welcome home party and she's family. It wouldn't exactly be
proper for him to show up with Vivian."

"But didn't he take Vivian to that charity gala just recently?"

"You guys are missing the point. Vivian has been unwell and tied up with filming that series Glimmer of Love. Word is, she's fallen sick again. There's no way she'd make it to something like a wine tasting."

"Exactly. It's a wine tasting, after all. Vivian is battling late-stage stomach cancer. You really expect her to show up and start drinking? That's insane. Do you want her dead sooner?"

"Yeah...when you put it that way, it makes sense."

Vivian's fans jumped in quickly to defend her.

"Millie is just shameless. She'll do anything for the Watsons' money. She's probably counting down the months until Vivian dies so she can keep living off Brandon and his family."

"Exactly. All she has to do is wait six months. Vivian will be gone, and she'll still have the Watson name.What's stopping her?"

"For real. With all those stories flying around about Brandon and Vivian, she still shows up with him?That woman must be obsessed with his money. It's pathetic."

···

"Brandon!" Babette spotted them as they entered the hotel and came over with a welcoming smile.

She raised her wine glass toward Brandon, but deliberately ignore Millie."

A waiter approached with a tray of glasses.

Millie and Brandon each picked one up.

Brandon stayed and exchanged a few casual words with Babette.

"I'll be joining the Watson Group soon. Don't even think about giving me the short end of the stick,"Babette said with a playful smirk, casting a sideways glance at Millie.

Brandon's expression remained calm. He simply gave a nod in response.

"Have you decided yet? Will you take over your father's company or start out somewhere else in the
group?" Brandon asked.

"I'll let you know later," Babette replied with a hint of mystery in her tone.

After exchanging greetings with the two, she turned and moved on to mingle with the other guests.

Brandon then led Millie toward a quieter corner of the room.

As they walked away, Babette shot them a glance with a mysterious glint in her eyes.

Millie followed Brandon to a sofa. They sat down but both remained in silence, like strangers.

"Your injury/ from the fall..." Brandon finally spoke, breaking the long silence.

But the moment the words left his mouth, he regretted it.

In the soft lighting, he could see that the skin exposed on Millie's arms looked smooth. There was no trace of the bruise or cut anymore.

Indeed,it had been several days. It might have healed by now.

Brandon looked up and saw Millie looking at him calmly.

"Ari mentioned your injuries to me the other day," Brandon added.

"It's healed," Millie replied plainly.

But while her body could heal, what she had lost could never be restored.

"I didn't mean for that to happen," Brandon finally said after a long pause.

That day had been a blur of chaos. When Millie fell down the stairs, all Brandon could remember were his own outstretched hand.

This time, Millie said nothing. Her eyes dropped to the glass of wine resting on the table.

Intentional or not, the child was gone. And nothing could bring them back.

A wave of sorrow welled up inside her, and Millie took a slow sip of wine, hoping it would dull the ache she carried.

Once again, silence stretched between them.
Neither of them spoke and the minutes crawled by
Brandon felt frustrated.
She had been distant like this for some time now.
How long was she going to keep shutting him out?
But looking at her now, so thin, with a quiet sadness lingering on her calm face, he didn't have the heart
to press her.
"I transferred some money to your account," he said softly."Now that you're better, make sure you
take care of yourself."
He couldn't stand seeing her so frail.
When he held her in his arms at Moonlit Estate the other day, she felt so light.
It was almost like she weighed nothing at all as he lifted her with no effort.
###Chapter 95 Who Are You To Judge Me
When Millie didn't respond, Brandon continued gently, "r'H take over Arl's tréatment. Pll bring in the best medical team. She'll get better."

"She's my child, Brandon. You don't need to worry about her," Millie finally said.

In that moment, she made up her mind not to take his money anymore.

If he had any decency left, he'd return the Bennett family's possessions once the divorce was finalized.
That would be fair compensation for everything she had done for him over the years.

"Giffard is a skilled doctor. He'l take good care of Ari," she added, her tone calm but firm.

Brandon's temper flared again.

"Isn't she my child too?" he snapped. "Do you even hear yourself right now?

Millie clenched her fists. She wanted to answer back, but stopped herself.

Only a week remained before the divorce could be finalized. Just seven days to go.

She couldn't afford to make things more complicated now.

Also, Ari would be legally adopted under her mother's name. Brandon would never have any claim to her.

But Brandon wasn't done. "I know you and Alexia are close-that's fine. But what's really going on between you and Giffard?"

Millie looked up, disbelief crossing her face. "Are you seriously accusing me now? There's nothing between us."

Brandon gave a bitter laugh.

He locked eyes with her, his voice cold. "I saw it myself. You and him were getting a little too close in that hospital room."
Millie paused, thinking back. Then it clicked.

"So that was you standing outside the hospital room door?"

He didn't answer. Just stared at her.

Was that supposed to be a confession? That he'd caught her?

She actually found it absurd.

A laugh escaped her lips.

"And who exactly are you to judge me?" she asked, a faint smile playing on her face. "You think P'm the one in the wrong? Your affair with Vivian is public knowledge. And now you're here,trying to lecture me about inappropriate relationships? Don't you think that's just a little hypocritical?"

There had never been anything inappropriate between her and Giffard. She'd made that clear to him that day, and nothing had happened since.

But even if there had been-so what?

Brandon's jaw tensed.

"So which one is it? Giffard? Charles?" he asked after a long pause. someone else entirely? What's the goal here? To make me jealous? Get me to leave Vivian?"

He didn't stop. "I've told you before, Millie. You'll always be my wife. Just wait six more months. Vivian won't be in the picture much longer."

He sighed and said sharply, clearly irritated, "Whatever this is, just stop."

Millie studied the man in front of her.

Half his face was cast in shadow, but his eyes remained vivid, piercing.

She used to love those eyes, especially when they reflected her, made her feel like she was the center of his world.

But now, those same eyes were hiding someone who could say such heartless things. He was defending another woman while telling her not to make a scene.
Did he truly belleve she belonged to him, no matter what?

Silence settled between them.

In the dim light, the only thing that sparkled was her earring catching the faint glow.

Just then, Brandon's phone buzzed.

He pulled f out, and Milie saw the name on the screen: Vivian.

She looked away and smiled faintly.

Brandon didn't answer.

The phone kept vibrating, but he made no move to pick it up.

"You're not going to answer?" Millie said, her voice edged with sarcasm. "Maybe she fainted again. You should go check on her."

"Enough!" Brandon snapped, unable to hold back any longer.

He hated it when she talked to him like that.

But Millie just stared at him coolly, that same composed smile still on her lips.

Brandon gripped his phone tightly, as if about to speak-but thought better of it.

Without a word, he slipped it back into his pocket.

Suddenly,nearby, someone's chain-strap purse knocked into a table, sending a bottle of red wine crashing to the floor.

It shattered on impact, wine spilling across the floor.

"Oh! Mr. Watson, I'm so sorry!" that woman exclaimed, rushing to get a waiter to clean the mess.

The sound and sight snapped Brandon back in time-to that year when he and Millie had gone on a business trip to Vascuosia. The hot spring hotel. The wine. The laughter.

"What if they want us to drink, Brandon? I'm not sure how much I can handle," Millie had asked back then.
They'd heard that the client they were scheduled to meet in three days had a fondness for alcohof.

Brandon had smiled reassuringly. "Don't worry. You won't have to drink.

At the time, Watson Group was in a period of transition-welf-established in Crobert, but still struggling to gain a foothold in the new sector.

"Even ifit comes to that, I'll take care of it," he promised.

But Millie had smiled, glancing at the wine bottle the client had sent over. " want to share the burden with you. Why don't we try it now? Let me see how much I can hand//she said, still smiling."That way,I'll know my limit before the meeting."

"Are you serious?" he'd asked, looking into her eyes.

She didn't reply. Instead, she reached for the bottle, opened it with steady hands, poured two glasses and handed one to him.

He took it, and she tapped her glass gently against his. Her eyes sparkled with excitement.

"To landing this contract," she said, and then tipped her glass back and finished it in one go.

He watched her, smiling, and mirrored her action.

She poured a second round and raised her glass again.

"To your health and happiness, Brandon." Another glass down in a single breath.

The alcohol brought a warm flush to her cheeks.

Outside, snow fell thick and fast. Inside the hotel room, the air was warm and inviting

He thought she looked absolutely adorable, and leaned in to kiss her.

Her lips tasted like red wine and laughter.

"I'm still fine!" she declared, nudging him playfully as she poured another.

"This one's for Watson Group's smooth transition... and this one's for you, Brandon.May you always stay as handsome as you are!" she added with a soft laugh.
They Jost count of how much they drank. Bottle after bottle arrivred at their room.

Eventually, she began to sway slightly, glass still in hand. "This one... she sfarted. She looked at him,eyes soft, heart open. "This one's for out everlasting happiness, Brandon."

But she only managed to take a few small sips from that last glass. She was too dlzzy to finish.

He kissed her again, holding her by the waist as wine spilled unnoticed onto the floor.

The atmosphere turned electric.

"We'll be happy," he whispered, his voice low, rough with emotion.

He pulled her onto his lap. Their breath mingled.

That night, they lost track of kisses, of time, of limits. They tried new things-there in the room, and again in the hot spring.

Red wine stained the floor. Her skin carried the scent of him and the wine.

Back at the wine tasting event, a waiter arrived to clean the mess.

The red liquid was wiped away slowly, methodically.

Millie turned aside, lost in the memory of that winter in Vascuosia. It had been so bitterly cold outside.

"Al cleaned up," the waiter said, collecting the broken glass.

The woman who had knocked the bottle apologized once more before hurrying off.

Brandon stared at the floor as it slowly dried. For reasons he couldn't name, the sight left him deeply unsettled.

They had once loved each other fiercely. Endured so much together. Now, all of it felt impossibly distant.

Where had it all gone wrong?

He didn't know. So he stayed silent.

At some point, the phone in his pocket had stopped buzzing.
Now, they just sat there, a heavy blanket of silence hanging between them
###Chapter 96 The Name Of The Wine
A sharp tapping rang out, and just like that, the room darkened, leaving only the stage lit in a clean circle of light.

Babette stepped forward in a sleek, strapless cocktail dress, drawing everyone's attention.

"Ladies and gentlemen!" She beamed. "Welcome to my welcome home party. Starting today, I'm officially returning to work in my homeland.I hope that-"

Brandon stared at her as she kept talking.

Brandon had no siblings. Babette was just his younger cousin-Derek's youngest son's daughter-and a golden child of the Watson name. Even while studying abroad, she'd already taken on tough assignments for the family's international ventures. Now, fresh from an lvy League school in Flesta, she shone like a headline. She carried her status like she had earned every bit of it.

As Babette's polished speech went on, Millie caught quiet conversations humming around her.

"They say she got a full scholarship and graduated with straight A's. Master's in finance too. Talk about impressive."

"Yeah, and two years ago, when she was only twenty-three, she handled that high-stakes mess overseas. Flesta's gun laws aren't as tight as ours, so that shootout she dealt with? Real stuff. And she was the one calling the shots."

"No wonder she's the one everyone thinks of when they/ hear 'Miss Watson,' even though there are other girls in the family."

"Apparently, she built strong connections in Flesta-really strong ones. She's coming back with years of solid contacts. I'm curious what role she'll take up now."

Amid the soft murmuring, Brandon's phone buzzed again.

He glanced down, brows furrowed. It was a call from Eugene.

Brandon stood and stepped aside into a quieter corner before picking up.
"What is it?" he asked flatly.

Eugene's tone was low and tense. "Mr. Watson, some unfamiliar faces have been snooping around the company.We did some digging-they're with the police."

Brandon's frown deepened.

The police? "What's going on with the police at the Watson Group? Have you uncovered anything?"

For a business the size of Watson Group, dealing with law enforcement wasn't unusual. It came with the territory-usually established lawsuits or routine checks. But quiet digging like this, behind closed doors, was something else.

Most times, it was about things cloaked in silence, the kind that demanded quiet digging and careful finding out.

"They have been careful," Eugene said."Asking all sorts of questions-mostly personal ones. About you and your wife. About Miss Simpson. Nothing direct, just chatty...like they're trying to piece things together. But from the way their questions were shaped, it is clear their main target is currently Macaulay."

Macauley.

Brandon's eyes went cold.

Why him? Why would they be after him?

Was it about that incident?

"Any news on where he is?" Brandon asked coldly.

"Nothing solid, Mr. Watson," Eugene said, clearly rattled.lost precious time since they didn't report his missing in time. Most of the leads have dried up."

If the police went after Macauley and uncovered what had happened back then, it wouldn't just blow over.

It would set off a chain reaction.

Once silenced, stirring it again would mean little to help with the situation now, particularly because...
"Keep digging. Bring in more people if you have to. We need to find Macauley before they do."Brandon's tone was cold. "And track the police. I want to know what they're really up to."

He understood the police wouldn't spill anything as this was a confidential investigation. So, for now, all he could do was wait.

"Yes, sir!" Eugene got to it immediately.

After the call, Brandon's eyes flicked over to Millie sitting quietly in her seat.

Should he say something to her about it?

He hesitated.

As he sat thinking, he glanced at his phone and saw that Vivian had called-and left a message after."Brandon, the police reached out-they were asking questions about Macauley. What should I say?"

Another message followed. "I said some random stuff, and then told them I was unwell and sent them away, but they'll probably follow up. I'm heading over now, just to quickly sort out what we should say.Ten minutes max. I know you're at that wine tasting with her-we just really need to talk."

Even before he could process it fully, the phone lit up again. Vivian was calling.

Millie, still seated, turned slightly as if she felt something change. She caught Brandon in the aishis brows furrowed as he stared at his screen and mumbled something under his breath before swiftly stepping out.

What was that about?

She didn't know-and honestly, she didn't feel like chasing answers.

She came for two things.

First, to answer Brandon's questions about Ari. She had given him enough time to talk. That was done.

Second-Babette.

What was Babette really planning by inviting her over tonight?

Millie turned to the stage.
Babette was wrapping up her speech.

With a graceful wave of her hand, a group of waiters wheeled in a long table.

It held rows of glasses filled with gleaming wine, each catching the light like cut glass.

"This batch is from a private vineyard in Flesta," Babette said gently, her eyes barely grazing Millie."Some of these bottles are nearly impossible to find elsewhere. Even the owner's personal brew is included."

A small smile tugged at her lips.

"And one of these is especially dear to the owneshe continued. "The owner made this wine-his own creation.He named it 'Miss."


Miss?

Was there a story behind the name?

Millie reached for the brochure on the table. The picture and words pulled her in immediately.

"Miss" was a red wine made by the vineyard's owner four years ago.

"Four years? That's not exactly rare. Doesn't seem special."

"Sure, the rest of the wines here have names that carry weight-La Romanee-Conti, for instance.Something more fitting for someone like Miss Watson, don't you think?"

"She said this one was the vineyard's owner's personal recipe. Maybe the owner's someone big?"

"Could be. But who?"

While murmurs floated through the room, Millie simply stared at the brochure.

The name of wine stared back at her-"Miss."

A man from Flesta brewed this wine four years ago and named it himself, and now Babette wanted Millie to know. Everything started to slowly fall into place.

Millie lifted her head to Babette.
Babette was already looking at her.

Across the room, Brandon stood with Vivian, mid-conversation. He sensed something and looked back towards Millie.
###Chapter 97 Tell Me,What Really Happened In Flesta
Babette spoke a few more words before inviting everyone to begin the tasting.

"To keep a little mystery-and since this is a tasting event-I won't reveal the names of the wines just yet. I'll announce them later. And for anyone who tastes and names them correctly, I've prepared a small gift." With a smile, she stepped down from the stage.

The guests began to gather, sampling the wines Babette had carefully selected and brought back from Flesta.

It was, after all, her welcome home celebration for Babette Watson. And as a member of the Watson family,Babette was someone people felt obliged to flatter-even if the little prizes didn't particularly interest them.

While the crowd mingled and raised toasts, Babette made her way directly to Millie,who was sitting quietly in a corner.

Millie stood up and walked over to a waiter to get a fresh glass of wine.

"Millie,"came Babette's voice just as she brought the glass to her nose, breathing in the aroma.

Millie lifted her head calmly, still holding the wine. After a brief pause, she turned to face Babette.

"I almost thought you wouldn't dare to come," Babette said with a smile. In the soft lighting, the gemstones around her neck caught the light and sparkled, making her appear especially radiant.

Millie didn't respond. She simply watched Babette, waiting.

"Can you guess which of the wines on that table is named 'Miss'?" Babette asked.

"There's no need for that," Millie replied evenly. "All the wines here are your best selections."

She paused, and then smiled. "They're all excellent."

But Babette's gaze sharpened, a silent warning in her eyes.

"No.You must," she said, her tone suddenly firmer.
Millie raised her chin slightly and met Babette's stare.

Then Babette stepped closer, crossing into her personal space. "James Bennett earned a master's degree in finance at 24, then joined one of the top investment banks in Mirough. In just four years, he rose from analyst to managing director. At 28, he returned to Crobert with consideable capital and quickly made a name for himself as an independent investor." Her voice was low, but deliberate.

Millie's expression didn't change, her eyes fixed ahead. But her fingers curled slightly around the stem of the wine glass.

"I heard from the older generation that Crobert's power structure had long been solidified-controlled for decades by the same few familiBabette continued. "But James was different. He had a real chance at becoming the fourth major force in the city. And not just because he was talented. He didn't belong to my grandfather's era. He emerged from my father's generation. People said he had the charisma, the vision, and the mind to play chess with the world. He mastered information like no one else.Psychology was his weapon."

She took a sip of her wine and smiled faintly. "But he still failed, didn't he? Took his own life, they say.Jumped. Left behind a brilliant wife and their only child."

Babette turned her gaze back to Millie."Isn't that right, Millie? James's only daughter."

Millie lowered her eyes, watching the golden liquid swirl inside her glass.

Her father's brilliance had once lit the path of her childhood.

But later...

Over the years, she had often wondered,who had been responsible for his death.

There were too many possibilities, too many shadows. No trail ever led anywhere.

"I thought you'd inherit some of his brilliance," Babette said, her voice now laced with contempt. "But look at you-compromising your dignity for comfort and a little fame. I despise people like you."

Millie closed her eyes briefly and then opened them, calm and steady. "If you despise me so much,why have you suddenly taken an interest in me lately?"

"Is it about Egbert? Or is it something else?"
Babette tilted her head slightly. "It's true I like him. But if you think I'm coming after you because of that,then you're underestimating me."

She paused to stare at Millie in the eye. "There are a few reasons,"she went on, her eyes narrowing. "I studied in Flesta for years, and even there, your father is still remembered as a legend. Naturally, I was curious about him and his daughter."

Then her tone sharpened. "But more than that, I can't stand that you are being credited as one of the key figures in the Watson Group's transformation. It's insulting. To me. To Brandon. To the entire Watson family. Let's be honest-it was the Watson Group's technological breakthrough that changed everything. Not you. And yet people talk as if you were the driving force. You're married to Brandon,but there are rumors about you and Egbert everywhere! It's disgusting!"

Millie looked at her quietly, noticing the bitterness behind her words.

And then she smiled. "I never spread those rumors myself," she said. "And I've never claimed to be the key to Watson Group's success. I told you that already back at Moonlit Estate."

What Babette hadn't realized was that fate never gave gifts freely. Everything came with a price.Sometimes, that price proved to be too much for some people.

Millie, once a noble heiress herself, understood what it meant to shoulder family legacy and ambition.She also knew that Babette wanted to make her own mark in the Watson family's history. But that didn't give her the right to project all of her resentment onto someone else.

"Is that what you told Brandon?" Babette asked coldly.

Millie didn't respond.

She and Brandon rarely discussed what had happened back in Flesta. The pain of losing their child she was carrying was something neither of them could bear to relive.

"Tell me, what really happened in Flesta?" Babette pressed, her voice rising. "Why is everyone so secretive about it? I asked Egbert. He said nothing. I asked Brandon. He wouldn't talk either. And that wine-why is it called 'Miss'? Did he make it for you?"

Millie looked at her. "I don't know anything about the wine. As for what happened in Flesta, it wasn't as dramatic as you imagine. Just a complicated situation that involved some of Egbert's personal matters.
If you want answers, ask him."

"I want you to tell me!" Babette stepped closer, her breathing uneven, the gemstones at her throat trembling.

Millie exhaled softly. "He has the right to decide what he wants to share."

The reckless risks of the past now seemed like the impulsive choices of youth.

Egbert might be just a bold and calculating young man back when she challenged him, but he was the head of a conglomerate now-definitely not someone to provoke lightly. And certainly, not someone she intended to offend.
###Chapter 98 You Didn't Win
Babette narrowed her eyes at Millie. "So, you've decided to abandon the Bennett family?"

Millie took a step forward, closing the space between them.

"Is that a threat?" she asked, her voice cold.

Babette gave a low, mirthless laugh. "Hasn't it always been a threat?"

Millie's eyes narrowed. "I thought this was a negotiation."

Babette sneered. "You're just a woman clinging to the Watson family to survive. What makes you think you have the right to negotiate with me?"

As she spoke, she waved her phone, the screen lit with a message from Vivian.

Then she pointed toward a side door, where Brandon stood, deep in conversation-with Vivian.

Even dressed plainly, there was no mistaking her.

Millie's lips curled faintly. Just moments ago, Brandon had refused Vivian's calls in front of her. And now here he was, bringing her in person.

"Brandon hasn't loved you for a long time,"Babette said flatly."Your time in the Watson family is almost up. What are you planning to do-wait for Vivian to die, pretend nothing happened and then keep playing the role of Mrs. Watson? It's not going to happen. Trust me."

But Millie didn't look away. Her eyes were still fixed on Brandon, who leaned in close to Vivian, pointing at something on her phone.

Their closeness, even in the dim light, was unmistakable.

"Had enough?" Babette asked, her voice cutting. "Vivian and I are working together. Taking over the Bennett family's remaining ties inside the Watson Group will be easy."

Millie finally turned back to face her. Babette smiled. "Your family's glory died with James."
As she saw the flickerin Millie's expression, Babette's laughter grew louder, more biting. "How does it feel? Do you hate me?"

But underneath the taunt, there was something else in her eyes-something heavy, something close to sorrow.

"I hate you more than you'll ever know,"Babette whispered. "Didn't you win him, Millie? Let's make a bet. If you win, I'll leave the Bennett family's old connections alone. But if you lose, you have two options-let me take over those connections... or tell me the truth about what happened in Flesta all those years ago."

She swirled the wine in her glass. "We'll bet on this wine. See all those glasses on the table? Choose the one you think is 'Miss'. Pick correctly, and you win."

Millie stared at her, a wave of sadness rising in her chest.

"This isn't the Babette I once knew," she said quietly.

The proud, poised Babette would never have resorted to such low tactics.

When had she changed? And why?

"What, are you afraid to bet?" Babette's voice had hardened, but there was a tremor in it.

Millie smiled faintly.

"Egbert's vineyard in southwest Flesta," she began,"isknown for producing wines with smooth texture and rich, fruity notes. He crafted this wine himself, four years ago. It's ruby red-clean, with a deep finish."

Babette's smile began to falter as Millie spoke.

"This," Millie continued, gesturing toward the table, "is a private collection. You wouldn't risk serving an inferior wine at your own party. Not when you're trying to secure yourplace in Crobert's elite circles.You wouldn't fake something Egbert gave you, either. Shall I go on?"

Babette said nothing. Millie walked slowly to the tasting table, scanned the glasses, and selected one.
She took a small sip, and then returned, glass in hand.

The wine shimmered like a jewel under the lights.
As she saw the flickerin Millie's expression, Babette's laughter grew louder, more biting. "How does it feel? Do you hate me?"

But underneath the taunt, there was something else in her eyes-something heavy, something close to sorrow.

"I hate you more than you'll ever know,"Babette whispered. "Didn't you win him, Millie? Let's make a bet. If you win, I'll leave the Bennett family's old connections alone. But if you lose, you have two options-let me take over those connections... or tell me the truth about what happened in Flesta all those years ago."

She swirled the wine in her glass. "We'll bet on this wine. See all those glasses on the table? Choose the one you think is 'Miss'. Pick correctly, and you win."

Millie stared at her, a wave of sadness rising in her chest.

"This isn't the Babette I once knew," she said quietly.

The proud, poised Babette would never have resorted to such low tactics.

When had she changed? And why?

"What, are you afraid to bet?" Babette's voice had hardened, but there was a tremor in it.

Millie smiled faintly.

"Egbert's vineyard in southwest Flesta," she began,"isknown for producing wines with smooth texture and rich, fruity notes. He crafted this wine himself, four years ago. It's ruby red-clean, with a deep finish."

Babette's smile began to falter as Millie spoke.

"This," Millie continued, gesturing toward the table, "is a private collection. You wouldn't risk serving an inferior wine at your own party. Not when you're trying to secure yourplace in Crobert's elite circles.You wouldn't fake something Egbert gave you, either. Shall I go on?"

Babette said nothing. Millie walked slowly to the tasting table, scanned the glasses, and selected one.
She took a small sip, and then returned, glass in hand.

The wine shimmered like a jewel under the lights.
"In his early days, he was cruel-everyone knew it. He went through business deals and walked away like they were games. What made you different? What did you do, Millie? What did you give him?"

Millie looked at her calmly, her grip steady on the glass. "You said it yourself, Babette. It wasn't me. It was the Watson Group's technical breakthrough that changed everything."

Babette froze.

The words she had used to discredit Millie had now been turned back on her.

And in doing so, they revealed the fact that Babette had believed Millie was at the heart of it all without even realizing it.

Red-eyed, Babette stared at her in silence. Millie didn't return the gaze.

she asked quietly,"what's the verdict? Did I win? If so, then the Bennett family's-"

"You didn't win!" Babette suddenly screamed. Her voice sliced through the hum of the crowd, drawing eyes.

"Yes, that glass is 'Miss'-but so what?" Her laugh was sharp, almost manic. "The Bennett family is gone, Millie. It's nothing now. What remains now is just a department under the Watson Group'sthumb.Your father is dead. Even if you picked the right wine, what does it-"

Before Babette could finish, Millie calmly lifted the glass and poured the ruby liquid over her.

The wine streamed down Babette's cheek, staining her skin, soaking her gown. The deep red clung like blood to her designer dress.

Millie stood still, the empty glass still in her hand.
###Chapter 99 It Makes Me Sick
Babette's shriek sliced through the noise, snapping every head in her direction.

All eyes landed on the star of the night-now drenched, crimson wine soaking her dress and dripping onto the marble floor.

Brandon came striding in from the far side, his pace quickening when he saw the commotion.

Millie lingered near the edge of the crowd, her gaze sharp and unblinking as Babette snatched a towel from a passing waiter and dabbed frantically at the spreading stains.

Millie had only shown up tonight for one reason-to hammer out an agreement with Babette.

But from the start, Babette had made it clear she'd come to play games.

It was Babette who'd set the terms, Babette who'd pushed for a public bet, and when she lost, Babette who flat-out refused to admit defeat.

Whatever had gone down between Millie and Egbert in Flesta while Brandon was away-that secret belonged to both of them. Babette didn't know the half of it. And even if Millie had confessed everything,Babette would only twist it, holding it over Millie's head every chance she got.

Worse,Babette hadn't hesitated to trash the Bennett name and hurl insults at Millie's father.

If negotiation was off the table, so be it. Millie steeled herself. Babette wanted a fight? She was about to get one.

Millie had no reason left to hold back her contempt.

"Millie, how dare you!" Babette's glare sharpened, fury twisting her features as she swung her hand up,ready to strike Millie across the face.

Before she could land the blow, Brandon appeared beside them in a blur, seizing Babette's wrist midair.

"Brandon!" Babette bellowed, her voice shaking with rage and humiliation. "Millie ruined my party!"

Ignoring Babette's outburst, Brandon leveled his gaze at Millie.
"Apologize," he ordered, his voice flat and devoid of warmth.

Millie let out a short, incredulous laugh.

He didn't know a thing about what had happened, yet here he was-issuing commands as if she owed him something.

Who the hell did he think he was?

Vivian, who had been following close behind, hurried to the scene. Her expression was frozen in shock,as if she couldn't believe what she was witnessing.

A low hum of whispers swept through the crowd.

"Millie." Brandon's voice cut through the noise, his tone edged with warning as he called her name.

Millie let out a small, amused laugh, her eyes flicking from Brandon to Vivian with a glint of challenge.

With a breezy, "Alright," she turned away, striding over to where the band stood frozen mid-performance.

The pianist hovered uncertainly, hands poised above the keys, casting uneasy glances at the unfolding drama.

Ignoring the tension, Millie reached for the violin case nearby and flipped it open.

She paused, eyes drifting shut for a breath, and then opened them, a glint of mischief sparking within.

Lifting the instrument to her chin, she let her fingers dance across the strings.

The tune she played was fiery, fast-påced, its rhythm pulsing with raw energy. Under Millie's deft fingers, the violin became a living thing, channeling her spirit and will.

The familiar notes of "Bullfight" filled the room, a song everyone knew well.

Millie had reworked the melody, letting her violin shriek and soar, each note ricocheting through the hall like raucous laughter.

By the time she finished, the vibrant, biting music had shattered the tension and left the crowd bursting into applause.
It wasn't just a bullfight song-it was a bullfighter's march.

And with Millie wielding the bow,the roles were obvious.

Babette,soaked in red wine and humiliated, was the bull on parade.

Brandon, demanding apologies without a clue, was swept up in the spectacle as well.

Millie's performance was a wicked, wordless taunt aimed at both of them.

She dipped into a crisp bow, and then rose to find someone watching from the far end of the hall-a man raising his glass, amusement dancing in his eyes.

He'd seen right through her game.

Between them, her jab needed no explanation.

Millie's lips curled into a subtle, knowing smile as she gently set the violin aside and turned to face Babette, who looked ready to explode.

"Did that meet your expectations?" Millie asked, her tone laced with playful sweetness.

Babette instantly caught the dig beneath Millie's words. Seething, she started to lunge forward, but Brandon stepped between them, blocking her path.

"That's enough, Babette," Brandon muttered sharply, a warning edge in his voice. He knew one more outburst would truly bring the whole party crashing down.

Babette understood that too-and she certainly didn't want Brandon digging into what she'd grilled Millie about in Flesta earlier.

With no way to vent her fury, she glared at Millie's faint, mocking smile, her hatred simmering just beneath the surface.

"It was just a little accident," Babette finally admitted, smiling with stiff lips and clenched teeth. "Things like that happen at wine-tasting parties."

Millie spun on her heel and strode off without another glance.

"Millie," Brandon caught her wrist, but she yanked free, spine stiff with resolve.
"Next time, if you plan on bringing Vivian, let me know in advance," Millie declared, enunciating each word with icy precision. "I refuse to share a room with your mistress. It makes me..." Her gaze flicked to Vivian,full of disdain. "Sick."

"Millie!" Brandon barked, warning and fury threading his voice.

But Millie just leveled him with a freezing stare.

One look was all it took-she walked away, head high, gown swishing behind her, not bothering to look back.

Brandon's fists clenched tight as he watched her retreat with such unshakable grace.

He narrowed his eyes at Babette, who was now fussing over her dress, playing the part of someone with nothing to hide.

They were out of the crowded hall now, standing in a hushed corridor, tension coiling between them.

Vivian had chosen not to follow, insisting she'd already stirred up enough drama for one night and would wait in the car instead.

Earlier, she'd quietly apologized to Brandon, explaining she'd only wanted to talk about Macauley-she never meant to get tangled in a misunderstanding with Millie.

Now,the hallway felt even emptier with just Brandon and Babette standing there.

Brandon fixed Babette with a sharp stare. "What exactly did you say to her?" he demanded.

Babette's hand stilled mid-wipe, towel pressed to her stained dress.

"Brandon, she's the one who threw wine at me!" she cried, hoping to sound indignant.

But Brandon's gaze stayed icy and unwavering.

He knew Millie's temperament-she never lashed out without cause.

Babette's pulse fluttered with panic.

She tried to hold her ground, but Brandon's next words shattered any hope of dodging responsibility.

He fixed her with a hard stare as he pressed. "You want to explain, or should I just pull the surveillance
footage?"

Babette's jaw tightened as panic flickered across her face.
The cameras might not have caught every word, but there'd be no hiding how she'd cornered Millie first.
After a tense beat, Babette ducked her head, her voice small. "I told her I'd join the Watson Group's finance department-the one that took over the Bennett family's contracts."
She left out everything about Flesta, carefully skirting the subject of her threats.
"I want the truth!" Brandon snapped, his tone cold and precise.
Tears sprang to Babette's eyes, her lower lip quivering. "Fine. I told her I could handle that job-so what if I said that? Does that mean she gets to humiliate me? She dumped wine on me at my own party, right in front of everyone! Who the hell did Millie think she was, and what did she see me as? With everyone watching, she still found a way to humiliate me!"

Carefully skirting any mention of Flesta or the bet-subjects she didn't dare touch-Babette whipped up her outrage, her voice rising as she burst into dramatic, noisy tears.
###Chapter 100 Her Mother
Tears streamed down Babette's cheeks as she stole furtiveglances at Brandon, but his eyes remained glacial, utterly unmoved by her display.

"Babette, should you desire it, you may select your position from any of the nation's premier public or private equity establishments," Brandon declared, each word delivered with surgical precision and glacial detachment. "However, that particular department remains under Bennett family jurisdiction.Your actions constitute a deliberate assault motivated purely by personal vendetta."

Babette's lips remained sealed, her eyes blazing with defiant fury as she locked her stare with his unwavering expression.

Brandon chose to dismiss her theatrics entirely.

The pieces finally clicked into place-he finally grasped the profound significance behind the "Bullfight" reference and comprehended the arctic hostility that had flickered across Millie's features before her departure.

The Bennett family/ had always commanded Millie's deepest reverence and loyalty, making Babette's calculated provocation an inevitable catalyst for her explosive reaction.

Also, witnessing Vivian's presence at the event had undoubtedly intensified her rage to unprecedented levels.

Nevertheless, Millie's decision to hurl wine across Babette's face before such a distinguished assembly crossed acceptable boundaries.

"Pack away your juvenile games," Brandon commanded, delivering his parting words with devastating finality."Remember-she holds the position of your cousin-in-lawno matter what."

Having issued his ultimatum, he pivoted sharply and strode away, abandoning Babette to her solitary rage.

Babette's composure shattered completely as she released a piercing shriek, her arms sweeping violently across the nearby table and sending its contents crashing to the floor.
Brandon navigated his path back toward his vehicle, where Vivian maintained her anxious vigil.

"Brandon," Vivian called out, her voice trembling with apprehension. "I'll make everything clear to Millie.Everything stemmed from the complications surrounding Macauley..."

Brandon could only meet her gaze with weary resignation.

"What explanation could possibly suffice?" Brandon questioned, his tone heavy with resignation. possesses no knowledge regarding the events from that period."

"The outcome was never part of my intentions... Brandon, you must believe that I never desired such consequences..." Vivian collapsed into heart-wrenching sobs, her composure completely shattered.

"Your sincerity isn't questioned." Brandon offered gentle consolation while releasing a weary exhalation. "Today's encounter represented nothing more than unfortunate timing, Vivian. I'll manage this delicate situation."


.--

Meanwhile, Millie guided her vehicle along the bustling avenue, enveloped by the amber luminescence of streetlights and the gradually diminishing urban landscape.

No particular destination occupied her thoughts as she contemplated her father's memory and yearned to spend time with Ari, though concern gnawed at her that her turbulent emotional state might cast shadows over Ari's spirits.

Her phone vibrated against the console.

Charles' name illuminated the display.

Gathering her composure like armor, Millie accepted the call.

Charles' voice erupted through the speaker, unleashing a torrent of colorful expletives. "That Brandon proves himself to be an absolute scoundrel! Escorting you to the gathering while simultaneously bringing Vivian as his companion!"

Millie recognized that Charles had initiated this conversation specifically to provide her with an outlet for her accumulated frustration regarding Brandon's latest betrayal.
"And regarding that Vivian woman! Never have I encountered such brazen audacity. My preference would be her immediate demise rather than waiting another six months!" Charles continued his passionate denunciation with an impressive arsenal of creative insults, prompting Millie to wonder whether he had enrolled in specialized courses for inventive verbal abuse.

The absurd mental image sparked genuine amusement within her, drawing forth a spontaneous chuckle.

Upon hearing her laughter, Charles allowed his tension to dissipate somewhat.

"The waiting period approaches its conclusion," he declared with conviction. "Merely a handful of days remain before you achieve complete liberation from any connections to him."

Millie directed her gaze calmly toward the illuminated roadway stretching ahead.

"Absolutely," she responded, her voice resonating with unwavering resolve.

Following several additional minutes of conversation, Millie concluded the call.

As she continued navigating through the city's nocturnal embrace, her emotional state experienced marginal improvement,though the enhancement remained disappointingly modest.

More than twenty days had elapsed since Brandon first proposed their divorce proceedings.

She had once painted vivid dreams of their shared future-strengthening the Watson Group's foundation, elevating the Bennett family's legacy, and finally unraveling the mystery surrounding her father's untimely death.

With the Watson family's unwavering support and genuine love flowing between them, every ambitious goal had sparkled with achievable promise.

Yet now, destiny had rewritten their story completely.

Babette's calculated disruption during today's event represented merely a superficial scratch on the surface, though it had managed to leave Millie's equilibrium thoroughly disturbed.

Her vehicle continued its purposeless journey through the city's labyrinthine streets.

Eventually, Millie discovered her car stationed outside the imposing facade of a luxury hotel.
Tilting her head upward toward one certain illuminated window on the third floor, she experienced a turbulent storm of conflicting emotions.

Her mother had traveled to Crobert specifically to manage Ari's complex adoption documentation and had established temporary residence within these walls.

Millie had personally arranged the luxurious suite for her mother's stay, ensuring every detail met the highest standards of comfort.

Despite these thoughtful preparations, te chasm between them as mother and daughter stretched impossibly wide.

She understood with painful clarity that her father's tragic death had devastated far more than just her own existence.

Her mother had endured equally profound devastation from that catastrophic loss.

However,circumstances and unspoken grievances had driven them to this cold impasse.

Her phone vibrated once more against the car's console.

Another incoming call demanded her attention.

Millie wrestled with uncertainty before ultimately deciding to accept the communication.

"Why don't you come up? I saw your car." Her mother's voice traveled through the speaker with characteristic directness.

Millie directed her gaze upward toward the third-floor window, where her mother's silhouette stood framed against the warm interior lighting.

"Very well," Millie responded with resigned acceptance.

Upon reaching the suite's entrance, the door swung open before her knuckles could make contact with its surface.

Her mother,Nicole Morrison, materialized in the doorway with composed dignity.

They regarded each other through a moment of profound silence, neither woman finding the courage to voice the familial acknowledgment both desperately craved.
Millie discovered herself incapable of uttering the simple word "Mom," while Nicole found her throat constricted against any verbal expression whatsoever.

Without exchanging pleasantries, Nicole guided Millie inside and positioned herself on the plush sofa,gesturing for her daughter to join her.

After an eternity of uncomnfortable silence stretched between them, Millie summoned the strength to break their mutual paralysis. "Since your arrival in Crobert, have you made the journey to visit him?"

"Yes, I have completed that obligation," Nicole replied with measured precision.

Both women understood perfectly that "him" referenced Nicole's second husband-the man she had married but eventually divorced following James' death and who now resided behind prison walls.

Millie delivered her announcement with stark simplicity.marriage is approaching its final dissolution as well."

Nicole's expression remained as unmovable as carved marble when she replied,"Very well."

Silence descended upon them once again like a heavy curtain, suffocating any possibility/of meaningful connection.

The antique clock mounted on the wall continued its soft, rhythmic ticking, marking each precious second of their strained encounter. Eventually, Nicole broke their stalemate with devastating finality. "I will personally manage all aspects of Ari's legal paperwork, so don't come back."

She was politely but firmly requesting Millie's departure.

Millie studied her mother's impassive features for an extended period before offering a single nod of acknowledgment. "I understand completely."

And with that crushing simplicity, they severed their brief connection after exchanging only the most essential words.

Before departing the suite, Millie systematically emptied her purse of every available bill and carefully placed her most treasured necklace upon the marble surface of the entryway table.

Returning to the solitude of the road, Millie resumed her aimless navigation through the city's darkened arteries.
She had harbored hope that driving without a destination might somehow lift the oppressive weight from her spirit, but the strategy had failed miserably.

The night's restless wind swept fallen leaves across her path, and Millie felt an involuntary shiver course through her body.

Enough wandering for one evening.

The time had arrived to seek the sanctuary of home.

A steaming hot bath followed by restorative sleep would surely make everything appear brighter when tomorrow's sun rose.

However, as she navigated toward the apartment complex where she currently resided, Brandon's distinctive Maybach materialized in her peripheral vision, parked with unmistakable intention.

He had successfully located her closely guarded address, despite her deliberate decision never to share this information with him.

She recognized that when Brandon committed himself to discovering something, the outcome became inevitable regardless of the obstacles placed in his path.

Millie forced herself to avoid overthinking this unwelcome development.

She maneuvered her vehicle into an available space and emerged onto the pavement, striding purposefully toward the building's entrance, though her progress encountered immediate interference.

"Millie," Brandon called her name with urgent intensity, quickly advancing forward to obstruct her intended path.
###Chapter 101 Just Leave Me Alone
Millie moved to slip past Brandon, but he blocked her path,holding firm.



He caught her wrist, his voice low. "I know Babette provoked you with the Bennett family."


At the sound of that name,Millie stopped in her tracks,her gaze steady and expectant.


"She's not joining that department," Brandon went on,hair tousled by the restless night wind. "Whenever you're ready to come back, that position will still be waiting."



Back?



Millie searched his face for some hint of sincerity, but her heart had long since closed that door.


Returning to Brandon and the Watson Group was the last thing she wanted. She'd had enough-of everything.


Brandon held her gaze, trying to decipher her thoughts, but her expression gave nothing away.


The wind shifted, sending a swirl of dry leaves skittering across the dimly lit path between them.
"And then?" Millie pressed, her voice edged with impatience.



"And then?" Brandon hesitated, his brows furrowing as he searched for the right words. "Vivian just needed something from me," he finally said. "She didn't go over there on purpose."


Millie let out a sharp,incredulous laugh.



Earlier, Babette had all but shoved her phone in Millie's face. One glance was enough-she'd seen through their little scheme in an instant.


Yet Brandon expected her to believe Vivian was innocent?


Did he really not know people, or did he just think she was that gullible?



Fed up,Millie wrenched her hand free from Brandon's grip and strode down the hallway,her heels clicking out her frustration.



He immediately stepped in front of her again, refusing to let her pass.



Millie stopped short, her patience snapping. "Brandon,"she bit out, pinning him with a glare. "Ever since the night you brought up divorce, I haven't interfered in your life at all."


She drew in a shaky breath, fists balled at her sides."But you..." Her voice rose, trembling with anger.
"You're the one who keeps parading your relationship with her around, turning it into a spectacle before our marriage is even over. Haven't you seen the headlines?Do you have any idea what people have been saying about me?"



Brandon's brow was knotted in frustration, and his silence hung between them. Millie let out a soft,rueful laugh, and then turned her attention to a spider methodically spinning its web in the shadowy corner of the hallway.


"I understand how much you care for her. You told me yourself-she's only got six months left," Millie noted,her voice low and even. "So please, can I ask you to spend those months quietly by her side?”


She paused, holding his gaze for a heartbeat longer before adding, "Just leave me alone. Stop dragging me into your mess."



She wanted nothing to do with their tangled lives.



Not anymore.



Without waiting for a reply, Millie strode away, her steps brisk and final.


Brandon's hand twitched, tempted to stop her, but he couldn't bring himself to reach for her.



He simply watched as she walked toward the elevator.


The doors slid shut, cutting her off from his sight- leaving him standing alone in the hallway, with nothing but silence for company.


Millie's words still reverberated in his head, each one cutting deeper than the last.


He'd come to clear the air, but in the end, any explanation felt meaningless.


As long as the truth about Vivian remained untold-and as long as Vivian was still alive-nothing he said could reach Millie now.



His hands curled into tight fists,haunted by the fading sensation of Millie's touch, and a hollow certainty that she was slipping farther away.



He lifted his gaze, following where she'd looked moments ago.



The spider in the corner had finished spinning its web,poised right in the center, waiting in absolute stillness.



Brandon forced himself to let go, pushing down the ache inside.



He finally understood the anger burning in Millie's eyes tonight. For now, he would give her space-wait for a better chance, another day,to say what truly mattered.



He shut his eyes, drew in a slow breath, and fought to regain his composure.



When he finally looked up, his face had smoothed into a mask of calm.



Brandon slipped into the driver's seat of the Maybach but left the engine off, motionless in the dim light.



His gaze drifted up, landing on the single lit window of Millie's apartment.



He didn't want to leave-not tonight. If al he could do was sit there in silence, that would have to be enough.



Upstairs,Millie finished her bath and stretched out on the bed, her damp hair fanned across the pillow.



She saw his presence lingering below through the window but stubbornly refused to let her thoughts wander to him.



Outside,the night air slipped through the half-open window, carrying the faintest trace of gardenia



And quietly, with neither of them moving, the long night slipped away.



Sometime during the night, a brief rain had swept through,leaving the street gleaming with moisture.



The following morning, as Millie gazed out her window,she noticed the storm had passed and the Maybach was nowhere in sight.



A single dry rectangle stood out against the dark,rain -soaked pavement-a silent marker that the car had sheltered there until dawn.
So,that was the end of it.



Millie drew in a slow breath, deciding right then to let the past drift away and focus on living well,come what may.







The days blurred together.


Before she knew it, the fourth round of the talent show Heavenly Melody had arrived.


Twenty-seven days had already slipped by since she and Brandon filed for divorce.



Inside the recording studio, Brandon was already there,just as he had been for the previous three broadcasts.He occupied the exact same seat.


Myron, Jayceon, and Adriana showed up as well.


Vivian offered them a polite greeting, but the trio from the Elliott family ignored her, their expressions frosty.When Vivian tried to approach, they simply brushed past, claiming seats as far away as possible.


Once they were seated, Adriana and Jayceon immediately launched into another one of teir endless squabbles, their sharp back-and-forth leaving no room for outsiders to chime in.


Shut out, Vivian had no choice but to turn her attention to Brandon.
Backstage in the dressing room, Millie had already finished preparing. This was the semi-final-tonight,half of the six contestants would be eliminated,leaving only the top three to continue.



Standing quietly with her phone in hand, Millie reread the message Vivian had just sent to Serena's account."Tonight is your last chance."


She lifted her gaze, catching sight of Vivian chatting up Brandon, a saccharine smile plastered across Vivian's face.



Since that bitter argument, Millie and Brandon hadn't exchanged a single word.



Brandon hadn't made any effort to approach Millie,and Millie, for her part, pretended he didn't exist.


They were nothing but strangers now-a clean break that made the prospect of signing the divorce papers in three days much simpler.



Charles finished giving a few instructions, and then hesitated before weaving his way toward the audience to catch up with the Elliott siblings.


The Elliott family hadn't even been involved with the show as one of its investors until just yesterday, when they swooped in at the last minute.


They'd missed their shot at a share of the profits, so they took a spot as advertisers instead.
More ad placements, whether in the live broadcast or the post-production edits, meant their brand would be everywhere.



The Elliott family's move wasn't exactly subtle. As one of the three powerhouses in Crobert, their grip on the gemstone and luxury goods market made their sponsorship instantly eye-catching.


Because it had all happened so abruptly, Charles wanted to get a read on their true intentions.


After exchanging a few pleasantries, he turned to head backstage-but just as he passed Brandon's row,Brandon called him over.



Vivian had already slipped away to get ready,so Brandon sat alone, his gaze fixed and unreadable.


Charles strode over, barely bothering to hide his disdain. "Did you need something?" he asked curtly,making no effort to sound friendly.


Brandon picked up on Charles' hostile tone, his brows drawing together in a faint frown.



"What exactly is your relationship with Millie?" His stare was sharp, relentless, searching Charles' face for any flicker of truth. "And Serena? What's really going on between you two?"


Charles nearly laughed out loud.


He wanted to snap, "None of your damn business,"
but reined himself in and forced his temper down."That's not something you need to know."



"Millie is my wife," Brandon declared, the words landing with deliberate force.



Charles let out a short, incredulous breath. He couldn't hold back anymore. He glanced over at Vivian, still visible across the room, and jabbed a finger in her direction. "Then who's that supposed to be?"



His tone dripped with sarcasm, the mock surprise doing nothing to hide his scorn.


If it weren't for all the cameras nearby, Charles would've openly rolled his eyes.


How the hell did Brandon have the guts to say that to him?
###Chapter 102 Take Good Care Of Her
Brandon's face remained unreadable,his gaze lowered,making it impossible to decipher what he was thinking


Just as Charles was about to lose his patience and walk off, Brandon spoke quietly, his voice barely loud enough for only them to hear. "Millie said the two of you were just friends."



Charles gave him a sideways glance. "And?"



Brandon looked up. "Take care of her. As a friend."



Before Charles could respond with his usual sarcasm,Brandon added, "Please. If you need anything...let me know."



Charles blinked, momentarily caught off guard. His reply, brimming with irritation, died on his lips.


After a short silence, he huffed, "I don't need you to tell me that," and stormed off, muttering under his breath.



As he disappeared backstage, Charles couldn't help but frown. What the hell was Brandon playing at?
Was he trying to balance Vivian and Millie? Waiting for Vivian to die before crawling back to Millie?



The thought made him recoil. He gagged dramatically,shaking his head in disgust.



Brandon stood silently, his eyes trailing after Charles,his expression unchanged








The fourth live broadcast of Heavenly Melody was electric with anticipation.



It was the semifinals, after all.



The crowd buzzed not just because of the stakes but also because Elliott Group had entered the scene.



Everyone already knew Brandon was backing Vivian,but Elliott Group? That was a whole different league.



Their grip on the luxury and fashion markets was massive. If one of the contestants caught their eye tonight, the doors to the upper echelon of fame would fly open.



And that opportunity was right here, right now.



The six semifinalists knew it.


They pulled out every trick they had and pushed their talents to the edge, determined to land in the top three-or at the very least, leave an impression on the Elliott family.



The crowd erupted in cheers after each amazing performance.



Millie had drawn the fourth slot.



As the third contestant wrapped up their performance,her phone buzzed. It was a message sent to Serena From Vivian. "Serena, I gave you a chance."


Millie's eyes flicked toward the judges' table. Vivian sat there, smiling. A smile that said checkmate.


So this was it. Vivian was finally making her move.


As the commercial break began and the stage cleared,Barbara came rushing over, nearly stumbling in her heels.



"Easy," Millie said, steadying her. "What's going on?"



Barbara hesitated,glancing around nervously.



There wasn't much time. The voting segment followed directly after the performance.



Barbara felt like this was Serena's last chance to clear her name.
Wordlessly, she handed over her tablet.



A headline blared across the screen.



"SCANDAL: Serena Ellsworth and Evans Entertainment CEO Charles Evans Accused of Vote-Rigging!"



#HeavenlyMelodyScandal



#SerenaRiggedVotes



Millie scanned the article. "Serena Ellsworth is a signed artist under Evans Entertainment," it began. "So of course they'd stack the odds in her favor. Rigging votes in the show? It was only a matter of time. But this show was supposed to be about fairness and raw talent. If Serena wins unfairly, it'll be a slap in the face to every other contestant."



Barbara leaned in. "You have to address this during the voting segment."


Millie nodded sharply. "Tell Charles... that talent speaks louder than rumors. The rest can wait."



"Got it." Barbara dashed off.



A stagehand called her name. It was time. Millie took a deep breath and stepped forward.



Meanwhile, in the audience, Jayceon had his phone out,showing his siblings the article.
"This is sabotage. Serena doesn't need to cheat. She's got talent," he growled.


His siblings nodded in agreement, scowling as they scrolled through the smear campaign.



Elsewhere, Brandon frowned as he caught wind of the rumors. His eyes drifted to the stage.



Lights dimmed. Commercials rolled.



Millie took her place center stage, staring out into the judging panel. Vivian was smiling smugly.


When their eyes met, Vivian mouthed two words-"Beg me."


Millie let out a soft, humorless laugh.


Vivian still didn't get it. In the face of real talent, all the manipulation in the world wouldn't matter.


Let the rumors swirl.



The truth would sing louder.



"Now, please welcome Serena Ellsworth performing 'Journey'!" the host announced when the commercial break ended.



The lights slowly lifted. Serena stood beneath them,dressed in a flowy dress-elegant, romantic,her mask delicate and shimmering. In her hand was a gleaming clarinet.



She brought the instrument to her lips and began to play.



A gentle melody unfolded, rich with emotion. Then came the vocals, soft and lyrical, telling the story of a traveler swept up in a dream of romance, joy, and freedom.



The stage transformed with her song: swirling mist,golden leaves, and delicate lighting created a dreamscape.



The audience leaned in, smiling.



But this was a fiercely competitive stage. This alone wasn't enough to dim the rest of the competition.



Discussions were raging online.



"This is it? Pretty song, sure,but where's the technique?It's the semifinals!"



"I knew it. Overhyped. Everyone else brought their A -game, and she's giving us a lullaby."



A wave of people guided the discussion.



Vivian watched Serena's gentle performance, her grin growing smug.
"You're done," she mouthed.



But then the lights dimmed again. Soon, a new scene bloomed.



Ancient scroll-like projections unfurled across the stage. The music shifted. The lights warmed.



Serena reappeared in ornate historical garb, her mask more intricate, and this time, she held a lyre.



She began with a few soft notes, the lights following her lead.



Then-



She struck the strings hard.



The sound cracked through the room like lightning.The tempo soared.



Her masterful voice followed. It was powerful-captivating.



The performance shifted from whimsical to legendary.



Gasps filled the auditorium. "What a beautiful performance!"



Her performance continued as the crowd held their breath.Each stroke,each vocal, invoked a feeling from the audience.
###Chapter 103 Whoever Millie Stood With Would Rise
As the music swelled, Serena's dance, voice, and shimmering lyre wove together, casting a luminous,otherworldly spell across the stage.


She moved like a vision conjured from a dream-so light, so mesmerizing, the audience barely dared to breathe.



All at once, the audience and the livestream viewers fell under her enchantment, captivated beyond words



Jayceon, who had been a bundle of nerves at the start, now sat transfixed, his eyes wide with amazement.



"That was flawless!" he blurted, unable to contain his awe. "Two languages, two instruments, two completely different stage styles-and she's blended them into this seamless, beautiful journey. There's nothing forced about it! The song's name is 'Journey,and it fits perfectly!"



He practically vibrated with excitement, unable to sit still as Serena's fanboy energy took over.



Even Adriana forgot to bicker with her brother this d Rise time,completely caught up in the sheer spectacle.


Beside them, Myron lingered in the shadows, lips curving into a subtle, knowing smile.


The crowd buzzed with astonishment, and online,where arguments had raged just moments earlier, the comment section exploded with admiration instead.


"Unbelievable!"



"She's out of this world!"


"There's nothing left to say that captures how I feel!"



"Watching her play the lyre was simply mesmerizing."


For a moment, every heated argument faded into silence.


But that was only the opening act.



The night held far more surprises in store.


As the stage went dark again, Serena's performance soared to even greater heights. Panoramas of distant lands appeared, painting the backdrop with scenes from another world.



Iconic moments from classic operas flickered across the screen, captivating the entire audience.


 
Then Serena reappeared, dressed in a sweeping gown Would Rise that shimmered beneath the spotlights.



A mask adorned her face, heightening the sense of drama, and she carried a violin with regal poise.



Serena drew her bow, and the violin burst to life,weaving an utterly spellbinding tapestry of sound.


As the song swelled, Vivian's easy smile curdled into a strained grimace.



They'd all practiced together, but every contestant kept a personal trick up their sleeve-as long as it passed staff approval, anything went.


With the semifinals underway, alliances had dissolved;there were no teams now.



Each person was out for themselves.



Jaw clenched, Vivian darted a covert glance around the table, and then fired off a discreet message to Oakley. "Didn't you promise to talk to Napier and keep Charles in check? What's happening? Why is there nothing wrong with the live stream?"



Oakley's response came back just as fast. "How would I know? | already told Grandpa about Charles messing around with Serena-about her getting pregnant,too.He was pissed. But after that mess with Millie, I tried again, and guess what he said?"
"What?"



"He just shrugged it off. He told me to focus on the company and stop bringing him any more dirt on Charles. I'm so fed up!" Oakley paced restlessly,frustration simmering just beneath his skin.



He'd thought everything was locked down-Napier had always been eager to help, yet suddenly,the man was acting like none of it mattered.



Where had things gone off the rails?



He replayed the timeline in his mind, every detail grating on his nerves. The shift started right after Serena and Napier's meeting at that auction.



Of course-Serena!



HHe shot a sharp, calculating look toward the stage,watching Serena bask in the spotlight. A knot of resentment twisted inside him.



Just then, Vivian's message flashed across his screen again. "I don't care. Make something happen, Oakley.We're in this together. If Serena gets ahead, we're both finished."


Oakley bristled, his jaw tightening. He still hadn't forgiven Vivian for seling him out last time, but he tamped down the urge to snap at her. Instead, his Would Rise reply was curt and tight. "I get it."



Pocketing his phone, Oakley stepped away from the sidelines and headed straight for the control room, his mind racing.



If he was going to sabotage Serena, there was no move more direct and effective than pulling the plug.



This was already the fourth live show-if Serena managed to reach the finals now, neither of them would ever catch up.



He was convinced now-someone in his crew was leaking information.



How else could Charles keep preempting his every move?



With a scowl, he crept toward the master switch,heart thudding as he reached out.



A heavy fist crashed into his jaw before he could touch it.



"Damn!" Oakley hit the floor hard, dazed, pain radiating through his cheek.


Charles stepped from the shadows, a self-satisfied grin tugging at his lips as he casually shook out his knuckles.
"Told you, Oakley. You're way too predictable,"Charles drawled, voice edged with mockery.



Oakley scrambled up, fists clenched, but before he could make a move, a wall of bodyguards swarmed out of the darkness, hemming him in from every side.


Charles let out a booming laugh, genuinely amused by the fury twisting Oakley's face.



"Come on, Oakley. Stop resorting to these cheap tricks." He sneered, pausing for effect. "If you want to win, maybe try using your head for once."



Oakley huffed, his eyes rolling skyward.



The irony of Charles-renowned for his explosive outbursts-lecturing him about using his head was almost laughable.



"You lucked out with Serena, didn't you? Let's see how you handle things without her for once!" Oakley shot back, voice bristling with challenge.



Charles arched a brow, unbothered. "You want a girlfriend? Go get one. Not my problem," he remarked,waving a lazy hand at his subordinates to stay sharp.



He then smirked, snapping, "Some of us have actual charisma. Wouldn't expect you to get it,though."
Without waiting for a response, Charles turned and strode toward the stage.


He paused at the edge, eyes fixed on Serena under the spotlight, a sly satisfaction playing at his lips.


He hadn't told Oakley the truth-that there was nothing going on between him and Serena. But who cared? There was nothing better than watching him pissed and frustrated.


At that moment, Serena's performance swept into its fourth act, capturing the essence of yet another country with every bold,passionate movement.


The spotlight found her in a scarlet dress, her solo tango radiating such energy that even without a partner, the romance of the dance seemed to swirl around her like living fire. The accordion's notes flickered through the theater, electrifying the air.


Charles' gaze locked on Millie as she commanded the stage.


He hadn't anticipated a break like this, but he recognized a gift when it landed in his lap.


Millie-once obsessed with the Watson Group and shackled to restoring the Bennett family's glories-had been forced by their alliance to rely on him for the first time. He'd grabbed that chance with both hands.
A quick glance at his phone revealed a frenzy: Evans Entertainment, Seville, and Alexia had whipped the public-opinion machine into a storm, fueling the hype online.



What had seemed an uphill battle was now tipping effortlessly in their favor, all because Millie's performance was too dazzling to deny.



Charles pocketed his phone, unable to suppress a sharp,satisfied laugh.



The Internet had labeled Millie a pitiful, clingy housewife-someone desperate to clutch at the Watson family's money. They couldn't have been more wrong.



The truth was simple-whoever Millie stood with would rise.



Charles knew it firsthand.



He'd spent years scraping for scraps behind his older brothers, barely a blip on his grandfather's radar. But since joining forces with Millie on Heavenly Melody,everything had changed. For the first time,his family saw him as someone worth betting on.
###Chapter 104 Serena And Charles' Relationship...
Soon, Serena's performance changed again. She was now representing the fifth and final country, Gliphis.



Wearing an otherworldly flowing white gown, she stood with quiet poise as she brought the flute to her lips. The tune she played was delicate andbright,each note floating effortlessly through the air.


As she set the flute aside and began to sing softly,her voice carried the audience into a breathtaking realm of imagination.



Across the span of her performance, five nations were showcased, each through its own language,instruments, and song. It felt like she took them on a seamless cultural journey.



Rather than a series of abrupt, scattered changes in style, the presentation had unfolded smoothly. It was a journey, after all.



It felt like glimpses of rich, ancient cultures threaded into one moving tapestry, blurring time and place in the most beautiful way.



As Serena brought her final performance to a close, face was hidden in the shadows among the audience.



He and Millie had visited every country showcased on that stage together, and even more.



Back when the Watson Group was beginning its transformation, she had been his constant travel companion, following him from one destination to another.



With her there, the long days and uncertain nights never felt empty.



She had always been a force of light, brimming with energy, and radiating endless hope.



"Brandon, we'll make it," she used to murmur close to his ear. "No matter what, I'll stay with you. We'll climb to the top together."



"| trust you," she would say with a bright smile. "So you have to trust me too."


Brandon's hands curled into tight fists as his thoughts slipped back to that night at the Moonlit Estate. Millie stood there, fragile and tearful, her spirit dimmed like a flower left too long in the cold.



His fists trembled with tension as Serena lowered her instrument and gave a graceful bow to the crowd.
Brandon shut his eyes.


A wave of applause erupted, loud and unrelenting, like a thunder eruption.


Everyone was clapping for her.


In just five minutes and thirty seconds, between costume changes and all, Serena had showcased an array of skills to perfection.


Technique aside, she displayed her mastery of storytelling.



Then the host stepped onto the stage as the lights turned back on.



"Let's give another round of applause to Serena for her wonderful performance!" the host called out, his voice brimming with enthusiasm.


The applause rose again, roaring through the hall like a tempest.


The host turned to Serena, his eyes gleaming with admiration. "Serena, you never cease to amaze us.After your last performance, Deep Sea,I couldn't help but wonder what you'd do next, and now I know!"


Millie let out a soft chuckle as she took the microphone. "Thank you."
After a brief interaction, it was time for her to make a final appeal to the audience.


Millie didn't perform further. What she had just delivered was already more than enough, and her body was worn out.


"Thank you, everyone, those here with us and those watching from different parts of the world. Today marks the fourth round of Heavenly Melody,and I wouldn't have made it this far without your support and the hard work of the entire team." Millie maintained a flawless smile, one that only grew warmer when she caught a glimpse of Vivian's sour expression on the judging panel. "I've heard some unfavorable rumors about me,but I believe that talent speaks louder than baseless rumors. So, please if you loved what you saw, cast your vote for me!"


With that, she gave another deep bow.


Sweat mixed with streaks of makeup trickled down her face and fell to the stage floor, shimmering under the lights.


This conveyed her hard work and sincerity.


She didn't need grand words or flowery speeches, just the truth. Millie understood that the audience here wasn't allowed to use their phones, so they might not know what was going on online right now.

Saying too much, or the wrong thing,could easily turn people against her.


So she focused on delivering a message that resonated with both those in the recording studio and those watching online.



And as she bowed again, waves of thunderous applause filled the hall.


Then,Millie turned and walked offstage.


Just before disappearing behind the curtains,she glanced at Vivian.



Vivian's mask of composure had dropped, and she was barely holding back her fury. Her eyes locked on Millie with unmistakable disdain.



Millie smiled and turned away.



The host immediately stepped in to keep the show moving.



Meanwhile, down the staff corridor, Barbara and Charles rushed over to meet her.



"Are you alright?" Charles asked with concern.



Millie gave a tired but bright smile. "Not as drained as you might think."
Charles didn't look convinced. They all knew how demanding the performance had been.



Barbara pulled out a pack of tissues in a hurry and began dabbing at Millie's sweat.



"Let me," Millie said, taking the tissues from her with a smile.



The three of them started walking together, heading toward the far end of the hallway.



Behind them, the crowd's cheers echoed, alive with enthusiasm and admiration.



Millie glanced down at the tissue in her hand, now blotched with traces of sweat and makeup.



She loved this feeling.


Shortly after, they arrived at Serena's dressing room.


Millie sunk into the couch with a sigh of relief.



Charles approached and handed her a tablet.



"Barbara passed along your message, and this is the result of their actions," Charles said.



Rumors had flooded the Internet accusing Serena and Charles of rigging the votes. People had questioned Serena's skill, casting shadows over her rising But now, those voices had gone quiet



The topic now dominating the trending list was #SerenaAbsoluteTalent



"In the face of such raw talent, no rumor stands a chance! I'm blown away. Vote for Serena right now,guys!"



"Where are the naysayers now? You cried foul play,but look at this performance! Would someone like Serena even need to cheat?"



"Right? I wasn't even watching this show, but people just couldn't stop talking and it got me really curious After watching her tonight, I'm completely hooked.Serena is the real deal!"



"She's so good that all those fake vote accusations just fall apart on their own!"


"Five countries, five languages, five songs,instruments, and styles blended so flawlessly. It was breathtaking! Honestly, I wasn't into the initial part,but now it feels like the perfect choice. If she didn't have a high vote count, I'd really start suspecting that the competition was rigged!"



"Exactly."



"| agree!"
Public opinion had taken a complete turn.



Charles glanced over as Millie scrolled through the comments, her expression calm and pleased "Satisfied?"



Millie nodded with a smile."Very!"



"But voting is not over yet. There's still time for them to pull more tricks," Charles said as he took back the tablet. "We still need to keep our eyes open."



Millie gazed thoughtfully at Vivian who was visible in the live broadcast.



There was no doubt in Millie's mind, that they hadn't seen the last of Vivian's schemes.



Vivian had already played her hand and there was no chance she'd let Millie off so easily!



Meanwhile, Vivian stayed a little longer for the broadcast before retreating into a quieter part of the staff corridor.



There, she kept up constant contact with Johnny's team.



Unbeknownst to her, a tiny pinhole camera hidden in the corner had been recording everything.



Her voice, filled with fury, echoed through the small space."How dare Serena challenge me! Johnny, we've got enough dirt to bury her. I want her reputation in ruins!"



Vivian had previously held back, waiting for Serena to come begging. But now, her patience had run out. She was set on completely tearing her down.



Soon after, a new trending topic hit the Internet "Serena and Charles' Relationship Exposed."
###Chapter 105 Blackmail
As the news exploded online, the sixth contestant was just about to step on stage.



In Serena's private dressing room, Millie finally noticed Vivian's move-she had seen the news.



She chuckled softly and glanced at Charles beside her.


Naturally, Charles had caught it too. He was already typing. "It's all because of that fake medical record from before," he wrote.



Millie smiled, shook her head, and sent a message to their group chat. "No need to get sidetracked. Our only focus right now should be my sheer talent."


Charles nodded in agreement. That was exactly the stance they had just decided on.



Serena was a contestant who wore a mask made specifically for the show. No one had heard of her before the competition began.



That meant her fans wereall viewers of this program,drawn purely by her performances.



As long as she delivered and didn't cross any serious lines, what did it matter if she had a boyfriend? And anyway,she didn't.



There was nothing to explain, and certainly nothing to deny.



"Got it!" Alexia replied instantly in the group chat.



Alexia and Seville were still at Sheridan's apartment.Although Sheridan used to only allow them to use the study,recently he'd started letting them use the living room freely.



Seville, though a bit of a homebody,had a sharp mind for PR.



He quickly mobilized all his buddies. "Group One, push the TalentsOverRumors hashtag-use sharp visuals and catchy memes. Group Two, create momentum around Serena's singing skills, boost every post highlighting her talent. Group Three, you're with me.We'll stir the waters and keep the opposition confused."



Alexia coordinated between the different teams, and then regrouped with Seville to consolidate data and plan their counterattack against Vivian's camp.



Everyone had their role.



Meanwhile, on the other side, Vivian's team, led by Johnny,was mobilizing as well.



Johnny gave his own set of instructions. "Group One, argue that Serena's performance wasn't about talent.Emphasize that this is a music competition. Her visual flair doesn't even count. Group Two, plant seeds about a possible romantic connection between Serena and Charles-suggest she lacks moral integrity. If necessary, start spreading rumors about her messy private life. Group Three, stay alert. When the opposing team moves,we strike back."



What followed was an all-out online war.



But in the end, Serena's ability spoke louder than any rumor.



"What do you mean she's not talented? Are you blind?Five instruments, five vocal styles, five languages-all in a single performance-with top-tier lyrics and composition. If that's not musical strength, what is?"



That comment soared to the top of the trending discussion,racking up thousands of likes.



It struck a chord with a wide audience.



Online users might be misled at times, but they weren't blind.



Back at Johnny's command center-



"Boss, we're losing ground. Serena's performance was too strong. Nothing we post is sticking. And their team's no slouch either."
One of his subordinates hesitated before asking,"Should we leak that miscarriage scandal we prepared?"



Johnny didn't dare take that step without consulting Vivian first.



He had already messaged her multiple times, but she still hadn't replied.



He grew more anxious as the sixth singer wrapped up and began the audience appeal part. He sent another message,urging a response.



Why hadn't Vivian reply to any of his messages?Because she was in trouble herself.



She was still in the staff corridor when someone approached her with a polite smile.



"Miss Simpson," the man said, "we have something you might find interesting."


Vivian ignored him at first, until he played a recording.


It was her voice recorded earlier in that same hallway.Her expression changed instantly.


The man leaned closer. "We've been planting devices here since the first live broadcast of Heavenly Melody.Think about everything you've said in this very corridor."
"You were recording me without permission?" Vivian's voice trembled with fury. "Aren't you afraid I'll sue?"



The man smirked. "Do you think we'd be doing this if we hadn't considered that? The question is-which is worse? Us getting sued, or having your secrets exposed? Think carefully. If you don't cooperate, my partner's heading straight to Serena. I'm sure she'd be very interested. Oh, and Millie too."



He lowered his voice. "Give us a little something,and you can keep Mr. Watson. Otherwise... if he finds out what you've been hiding, I doubt it'll be worth it."


He began to count. "One. Two. Th-"


"Fine," Vivian snapped before he could finish.



Back in Serena's dressing room,Millie found it strange that Vivian hadn't made another move.



She exchanged a look with Charles.



He seemed puzzled as well.



This wasn't like Vivian.



Just then, the sixth contestant finished their appeal.Commercials and variety clips rolled, giving both the live and online audiences time to cast their votes.


 
Voting inside the venue moved steadily, while online voting was a heated race.



Serena remained in first place, but the other contestants were closing in.



Each had their own fanbase, and online voting allowed fans to cast multiple votes across different contestants.



Vivian finally emerged from the small room with an ugly expression on her face.


They had demanded ten million dollars.



Where was she supposed to find that kind of money so quickly? And even if she could,it wasn't worth it.



"Miss Simpson," the man had told her, "you can transfer two million now. The rest? Get it from Brandon. With his wealth, ten million won't be a problem."



Left with no choice, Vivian transferred the two million and left.



The blackmailers weren't worried she'd run. They had leverage-and they knew it.



They celebrated behind her back.



"Boss, you're a genius! I was getting impatient, but you said to wait. You were right! Now she has no way out!"
"Yeah, boss! You've really nailed it!"



They laughed, oblivious to the cold glint in Vivian's eyes as she walked away.



Paying them off wasn't enough to fix the problem She had to silence them for good. Otherwise, they'd just keep coming back for more.



She still planned to marry Brandon, and she had to ensure nothing got in the way.



Her expression unreadable, Vivian pulled out her phone and saw Johnny's latest message. She was just about to reply when everything changed
###Chapter 106 Suspicions On Vivian
At that moment, Millie sensed something odd.



"What's happening? Who are these people? Why are they helping us all of a sudden?" Barbara asked,confused.



A new,unknown force had suddenly appeared online.


In just minutes, all the earlier rumors vanished.


"Should we keep going?" Charles asked quietly.



Millie shook her head.



The result was already clear. There was no need to push further.



She didn't care much about publicity. With her talent,as long as nothing unexpected happened, she could rise on her own.



But Vivian had been after her from the start.



First,Vivian and Oakley had reduced the quality of her videos. Then they tried to drag her name through the mud.
Seville had told her they even started spreading vile rumors, claiming she had seduced the entire Heavenly Melody production team to get ahead.



It was cruel and disgusting-plain slut-shaming.


But Millie wasn't the type to sit back and take it.


Thankfully, her talent spoke louder than any lie. The rumors didn't stick.



Still,this sudden support...


Millie frowned. It felt overwhelming.



"Who do you think it is?" Charles asked.


"We need to find out. Let's look into it," Millie replied.



Charles nodded in agreement.



Meanwhile,Vivian sent a message to Johnny. lost control. Hold off on the miscarriage story-save it as a backup."



Not long after, the rankings for the fourth round of Heavenly Melody were released.



Serena took the top spot without question.



The others followed in their places.
The round ended quietly, though the tension still lingered.



Everyone left in an orderly line



Millie was about to leave too. But backstage, as she walked past Vivian, Vivian suddenly reached for her.



Millie quickly pulled her hand back,avoiding the touch.



If not for Vivian's terminal illness and the crowd watching, Millie might've slapped her right there.



"Don't think you've won, Serena," Vivian hissed in a rough voice



"You should worry about yourself," Millie said coldly.


Beside her, Barbara scoffed,"Yeah, Serena has better things to do. Step aside."



Barbara's attitude had changed completely. She used to admire Vivian. But after everything she'd seen,Vivian disgusted her.



"You!" Vivian snapped, glaring at her.



Barbara stood firm. She looked Vivian straight in the eye. "Everyone online is asking who keeps targeting Serena,and guess who's their prime suspect? Instead of throwing threats here, maybe focus on yourself,Miss Simpson."
Then she turned and walked off with Millie.



Vivian clenched her fists, trying not to explode.


The Internet was indeed already buzzing.


People were discussing it without any prompting.


"It's too strange. Serena's the target every time.Who did she offend? That last rumor was awful. If the public didn't already respect her, it could've ruined her."



One or two incidents could be coincidence. But this had gone on from round one to round four.



At first, fingers pointed at Oakley. But Oakley didn't plan to take the fall for Vivian.


He posted a video from the hospital, showing himself being treated by the nurse. The caption read, "Not your guy."


He looked beaten and pitiful in the video with all those bruises-but also kind of funny.



His eyes were full of complaint.



Rumor had it he'd been slammed to the floor in the power room.


Sharp-eyed netizens guessed he'd tried to cut the power and got stopped by Charles.
People still had doubts about him, but they were fading.



In the end, suspicion turned to Vivian.



After Oakley, she was the only one with enough backing-thanks to Brandon.



It all added up.



Vivian couldn't help but feel restless.



She thought she had everything under control. She had so much dirt on Serena. But it still slipped through her fingers.



She figured out two reasons why.


First, she had been pulled away by blackmailers at the worst moment-she missed her chance to strike back.



Second, an unexpected force had stepped in and changed everything.



According to Johnny, even Serena's team didn't know who it was.



Vivian stared after Serena's fading figure.



Serena had slipped away again.



But Vivian couldn't dwell on it now. She had her own mess to clean up.



Her eyes reddened as she walked toward Brandon.




···



Meanwhile,Millie,Barbara,and Charles reached the RV.



There,the Elliott siblings were waiting.


Jayceon ran up, beaming. "You're incredible, Serena!

You amaze me every time. I'm your biggest fan now!"


Adriana smiled and quickly tugged him back so he wouldn't overwhelm Millie.



Myron stood off to the side, watching.



Suddenly,an idea hit Millie.



She paused and said, "The online rumors..."



She didn't finsh. She wasn't sure yet.



"Yeah, it was Myron," Jayceon answered before she could ask. "I helped too!"



Millie blinked, surprised. Her eyes turned to Myron.



"Elliott Group sponsors the show. You're the biggest draw-can'tlet them drag your name through the mud,"Myron explained simply.
It all made sense now.



Before Elliott Group stepped in, there'd been no outside help. But the day after they joined, things changed.


It was logical. No one wanted to waste their investment.



"Thank you," Millie said, sincere.



Adriana gave a nod.



Jayceon huffed, "You're super talented. I don't get those people! Why bring nonsense into a talent show?"



Then, after a short pause, he peeked between Charles and Serena. "You and Charles..." he asked in a whisper.



Millie almost laughed. He was like a curious golden retriever.



"Charles and I are just friends-and business partners.The rumors are nonsense," Millie replied.



Charles nodded. "Yes, we're just friends. And there are..other reasons we can't talk about yet."



He did have feelings for Millie. But she clearly didn't feel the same. He didn't want people getting the wrong idea.
"Okay,hehe... Ow, Adriana!" Jayceon yelped when his sister smacked him.



"Ignore him. He's a goof," Adriana said to Serena with a small smile.



Millie didn't mind. Jayceon was just young and curious.



She nodded lightly to them, and Myron gave a small nod in return.



The siblings soon left.



It was a well-timed meeting.



Millie turned to board the RV.



But just then, a hand pressed against the door.


She looked up. Brandon stood there, lips tight,eyes deep and searching.


He stared at her as if trying to see beneath her mask.
###Chapter 107 Who Exactly Are You
Charles cut in, tugging Brandon to the side with a scowl. "Listen up, Brandon. I might not be as powerful as you, but you don't get to walk all over my friends.Not happening."


He then shot Barbara a pointed look.



Barbara got the message, slipping over to help Millie up the steps and into the RV.


As Millie'sfoot landed on the first stair, Brandon's voice cut through the tension behind her.


"And who exactly are you, Serena?" Brandon demanded sharply, a flicker of challenge in his eyes.


Charles froze, momentarily thrown off, his gaze drifting silently to Millie for help.


Without turning, Millie answered, her tone calm and precise, "Mr. Watson, if you've got doubts, make it clear.Otherwise, I have nothing to add."


Brandon's stare lingered on her silhouette. "With the kind of talent and skill you've shown, there's no way you're just some nobody," he noted, his voice steady but firm. "So tell me-what are you really after?"



"Why do you even care?" Charles snapped angrily before Millie had a chance to speak. "Seriously, what else could a singer possibly be after for joining a music show?"



He sounded almost exasperated, as if Brandon's line of questioning defied all logic.


Brandon's reply was a single, frigid glance-an unspoken dismissal that made Charles look foolish just for asking.



Millie instantly grasped Brandon's point. She knew he was hinting at the whole situation with Vivian.


Charles' outburst, however, came as a welcome distraction, sparing her from the need to reply at all.


Seizing the moment, Millie moved to climb into the RV,her mind already shifting ahead.



But Brandon's voice cut through the air behind her. "I'm not here to interrogate you," he called in an even tone."Vivian's my responsibility-I'll deal with her problems myself.Whatever plans you have, just keep what I said in mind."



Millie froze before turning to face him at last.



Brandon remained where he was, the darkness at his back stretching on forever. A restless breeze flicked across the night, tossing a stray lock of hair over his brow.



Was this supposed to be a warning or just a notification?



He didn't bother with the usual appeals to Vivian's fragile health or so-called kindness.



This time, Brandon skipped any pretense of explanation.



He spelled it out for her: No matter what she did, he'd side with Vivian. He wanted her to know-before she made her move-she had better think hard about whether she was really ready to challenge him.



Millie's lips curved into a faint, ironic smile.



Was this his idea of love?



If what he felt for Vivian was love, then what had all those stolen hours and whispered words between them ever meant?



Despite all her efforts to break away from them,they refused to let her go, cornering her at every turn.



Anxiety and fury twisted inside her.



Her fists curled tight at her sides.
Right then, both Millie's and Charles' phones buzzed.


Millie slid hers out, her pulse stuttering as she read the group chat.



Seville had just dropped a bombshell-news of Vivian's latest move, complete with a string of links.



"Serena's scandalous private life exposed-she suffered a miscarriage just ten days before the first 'Heavenly Melody' live show."


"Charles' sponsorship of Serena on 'Heavenly Melody 'was allegedly compensation for her recent loss."



"Serena faked a donation at the Evans charity gala-her name was missing from the official list, yet she showed up and joined the donors' group photo.Totally unethical."



Charles had seen theaccusations too.



He wasn't naive at all. Holding up the screenshots before Brandon, he huffed, "I know why you're here,but take a look at this first. Is this really the 'kind'Vivian you're defending?"



Brandon's mouth tightened. His gaze flicked toward the car door, but the mysterious woman behind the mask had already slipped away.
Done shouting, Charles lost interest in the argument.He stormed off and climbed into the RV without another word.



The engine rumbled to life, and the vehicle rolled smoothly past Brandon, who raised his eyes just in time to glimpse Serena's masked silhouette through the window.



Inside, the makeup artist began her work,efficiently stripping away the remnants of the performance.



Beneath the mask, Serena's skin was bare-only her jaw and lips had been touched with makeup.



Barbara glared at her phone, cheeks flushed with anger. "Unbelievable! How can someone stoop so low?| actually thought Vivian was kind and decent, you know? She used her own struggles to lift up others fighting illness, and I thought it was so inspiring. But now-seeing all this made up... Mr. Evans, Serena,what's our move? And what about Mr. Watson, still backing Vivian? Are we just letting him go unchecked?"



Charles clearly wanted to strategize with Millie, but with Barbara listening, he stayed noncommittal,assuring her they'd take care of it.



Midway through the drive, Millie and Charles left the RV behind for the quiet privacy of his Bentley.
The moment the doors shut, Millie tugged off her mask,finally able to breathe.



Charles, eyes fixed on the latest headlines, asked quietly, "What do you think?" His phone glowed in his hand as scandal after scandal poured in.



Usually, Serena was untouchable-petty gossip never stuck for long.



So what if Serena was seeing someone? Those could be shrugged off.


But this time, things were different.



Charles' "sponsorship" could be brushed off as tabloid fodder or baseless gossip, but a fake charity donation...



Charles set his jaw, replying, "That's where things got tricky-Serena's name wasn't anywhere on the official list that day. You told me to keep the donor's identity under wraps, so the tanzanite's real source was never made public."



Serena had bought Ari's painting, but thanks to her fierce bidding duel with Brandon earlier that night,her number stood out. To keep things quiet, she'd ended up using Charles' bidding paddle, so naturally, the name "Serena" never appeared on the auction recordds.



All the elaborate precautions they'd taken to shield her identity were now backfiring spectacularly



A fake charity donation wasn't some minor scandal.



For a celebrity, it was career-ending. Anyone linked to such a controversy was instantly blacklisted from the industry.



Not even Evans Entertainment's connections could offset that kind of stain-no investor wanted anything to do with a star whose reputation was this toxic.



Millie scrolled through the relentless barrage of online comments.



Any praise for Serena's talent had evaporated; the narrative had flipped, and now every word was vicious.



"That event was a charity gala to raise funds for kids with critical illnesses. I remember Serena pushing hard to publicize her involvement-she even went head-to -head with Brandon in a bidding war."



"Yeah! Even if she managed to win a bid, it didn't qualify as a fake donation. The children's artwork at the event wasn't even pricey. Using those kids' stories for publicity without spending a dime? That's just plain sick."



"And she actually had the nerve to pose with the real donors for a group photo. Talk about shameless!"
"Talent's one thing, but she's rotten inside. What does it matter how gifted she is if she's tied up in scandals -phony charity donations, selling herself for personal gain? Just those two alone are enough to ruin her!"



"If Serena can walk away from this and win in this show,then showbiz is truly hopeless."



"Indeed! If she gets away with this, what about my idol? They were blacklisted for far less."



"Same here. My favorite used to be an A-lister, but one scandal and they were gone for good."



"If someone like Serena can stay in the spotlight,then I want justice for my idol, too!"


The online backlash exploded, and Serena's support nosedived.



Millie and Charles kept a close watch, but they weren't the only ones-Brandon was tracking every new development,too.
###Chapter 108 Losing Sight Of Who Vivian Truly Was
Brandon remained silent, his hands steady on the wheel as he drove Vivian back.


He kept asking himself-was he beginning to lose sight of who Vivian really was?



Vivian said nothing either.



Ever since she started tapping into the Watson Group's entertainment resources, things had changed.Some outcomes were unavoidable now.



This time, with mysterious forces moving behind the scenes to help Serena and that Johnny's team couldn't handle alone, she'd gone back to the Watson Group.



But she had been smarter about it.



She'd learned from last time. This time, she drew lines -clear ones.



She only used the Watson Group's power to clean up rumors about herself and to expose Serena's miscarriage.
The messier things-the accusations about sex-for-power and donation fraud-were left to Johnny's team to deal with, all quietly.



So when Brandon received updates, all he saw were the basics: Vivian using his people to shut down false claims and retaliating a little by revealing Serena's miscarriage.



Everything else was just suspicion-no proof, unless she confessed.



The drive stretched on in silence.



Finally, as the car slowed in front of the floral studio,Vivian turned to speak.



"Brandon, I know you're not happy about what I'm doing," she said softly,"but I don't want to lie to you.If I wanted to do this behind your back, I could've gone to Oakley. He'd jump at the chance to destroy Charles. But instead, I chose to show you this version of me."



She looked straight at him



His eyes were dark. She couldn't tell what was behind them.



"She came at me too hard. I had to fight back. And all I did was tell the truth. She did have a miscarriage- ten days before the first live show. I didn't make it up."Vivian's voice wavered, her eyes growing red. "Maybe you'll be disappointed in me. But I think honesty matters. It should count for something."



Tears fell, streaking down her cheeks. "Just like..." she whispered, "just like I know Millie is still in your heart We can't pretend these things don't exist. So let's not."



Brandon watched her cry, unsure how to feel.



He knew people weren't simple. They were layered.


Millie had stood beside him for years, and even with her,he had never believed she was entirely innocent of strategy.



And he didn't want her to be. He liked that she could think for herself, act when needed, and take hold of power when the moment demanded it.


He wanted her to be strong enough to survive, even if he wasn't there someday.



But still,he believed in limits.



There had to be a line. Something that separated defense from cruelty. That line was what made trust possible.



So was Vivian really merely revealing Serena's miscarriage, or did she do more?
As if reading his silence, Vivian continued, "Brandon, I know wwhat you're thinking. But I didn't do those other things. I swear. If I'm lying, I'll get hit by a car the moment I step out of here." Her voice trembled. "I'm not the only one who wants to bring Serena and Charles down. Last time-it was Oakley. Not me." She paused, looking at him with eyes that tried to seem calm.



"If you don't believe me," she said, trying to sound indifferent, "then go. Go back to Millie. She'll be happy. I won't be around for long, so you don't have to think about me."



Her voice cracked, but she kept going. "I was just defending myself. I didn't do anything wrong.Someone else would've exposed her miscarriage anyway even if I hadn't stepped in. I'm not doing this just for me. I'm doing it for all those who've believed in me. I have my own needs, Brandon. My own goals."



Brandon frowned. Her tears were steady now.



A dull headache was already forming at his temples.



Eugene's investigation had confirmed that Vivian had only pushed back against the rumors and exposed Serena's miscarriage.



But still, something didn't sit right.
Was he overthinking things?



He didn't know.



As Vivian kept crying, Brandon simply said,"Go get some rest. You're not feeling well."



...



Meanwhile,Charles had taken Millie to Sheridan's place.



Everyone was already there,waiting.



"What do we do now?" one of them asked. They all knew who Serena really was. And they all knew what was at stake.



Only three days left. Then the divorce could be finalized.



If Serena's identity as Millie came out now,would that ruin everything?


Everyone in this room knew Millie wanted out. She was serious about the divorce. But if the truth came out too soon, it could block the process.



Worse, if Vivian found out who Serena really was, no one could predict what she'd do next.



Charles' phone buzzed again.
Millie saw the screen-calls from nearly every investor tied to the show.



Charles didn't pick up. He didn't dare to.



More notifications followed. Messages, one after another.



Millie leaned closer and saw the same thing over and over-demands that Serena be taken off the show.



The pressure on Charles was piling up fast.



The donation fraud rumors had exploded, and the fallout was already affecting the show.



None of the investors wanted to take risks. If things got worse, they'd pull out completely before the entire program would collapse.



Charles rubbed his forehead. His head was throbbing.He flashed his phone at Millie briefly, and then slipped it back into his pocket.



They needed to come up with a plan. And fast. 1



"Let's not rush," Millie said.



She had been thinking on the ride over.



"The next livestream is the final one. If everything stays on track, I'll have the divorce decree before it Everyone nodded.



"So for now," she said,looking around the room,stall. That's the strategy. Keep my position. Don't let them disqualify me. Keep the program running. Once the divorce comes through, we'll have more control."



They all nodded again-but quietly. No one spoke.



There were too many unknowns.



Would the divorce really go through without issue?And how long could they hold things off?



Charles knew Serena's real identity. But the other investors didn't-and they couldn't be told.How could they fix this without revealing the truth?



The tension in the living room hung heavy.



What had started as trivial had now turned into something serious, something dangerous.


They all sat with it.



Then Millie's phone vibrated.



She looked down. A call-Serena's line.



"Who is it?" Alexia asked quickly. Millie shook her head. "I don't know."



"You think someone leaked your info? Maybe it's another attack," Alexia said, her voice tense. She'd seen too much of that in the industry.



Seville nodded in agreement. He had seen the same.


"Can you set up a blocker for Millie's phone?" Seville asked Sheridan.



Sheridan was already reaching for his laptop.



Millie stared at her phone. She didn't answer.



The call ended on its own. Then two messages appeared on the screen.
###Chapter 109 Never Again Would She Be Powerless
"Serena, I already gave you a chance. So far, you've just been lucky. Did you honestly think I wouldn't retaliate? Get down on your knees and beg-maybe then I'll consider throwing you a lifeline." Vivian's messages lit up the screen, each one dripping with contempt.


Charles took one look and unleashed a string of curses.



Alexia and Seville erupted as well, their outrage filling the room with heated voices.



Millie's grip on her phone tightened until her knuckles blanched.



Vivian's constant threats and smug sense of control made it feel as if waiting for some miracle was the only path left.


But Millie refused to stand by any longer.



She saw, clear as day, her father's tormented face beneath stormy clouds, the boy shielding her with nothing but a broken board, and the tiny, silent child she had lost.
She wasn't about to let anyone dictate her fate anymore.



Never again would she be powerless.



Millie pressed her nails into her palm until pain cut through the haze, jolting her thoughts into focus.



A few more days-she just needed a little more time to secure the divorce decree. But right now, chaos from the show demanded her full attention.



Only two things mattered for now. Would the show be axed without warning due to the scandal? Or would the sponsors force her out before that?



She blinked, her gaze sharpening with a sudden,unshakable resolve.



Walking away was never an option-not for her.



If every sponsor turned on her, could shemanage to buy herself some breathing room?



She didn't have to wait for the final broadcast to clear her name. Three days. That was all she needed-just three days to get the decree and present undeniable evidence. After that, no one would be able to push her aside.



Netizens might also demand answers, so the production team would have to offer a clear solution.Still, they could respond by saying, "To ensure fairness, we need time to investigate," and publicly guarantee a resolution before the final live broadcast -within four or five days at most.



Millie turned to Charles, her tone quietly apologetic."You might have to take some heat for me these next few days." She spoke with crisp determination. "You'll probably need to step up and promise them a solid answer wwithin four or five days-no later than the final broadcast."



Her reasoning laid out, Charles caught on instantly, his eyes flickering with sudden energy.



"Absolutely-a strategic delay!" he declared, nodding with conviction. "Leave it to me. I'll kick up a fuss and buy us time. With your plan, the netizens and sponsors should settle for a brief delay. I'll lean on the Evans family name to pressure them if I have to. Once you get the decree, everything will fall into place."



The room erupted with nods of agreement.



Alexia chimed in, her excitement bubbling over,"Exactly! There's no need to drag this out until the finals-we only need a few days!"



"She's cracked it!" Seville whispered to Sheridan as he stepped back in. "Honestly, her brain works fast."
Right then, Charles' phone buzzed again. He glanced at the screen-Napier was calling.



This time, Charles didn't dare let it go to voicemail.



"Come back right now." Napier's tone brooked no argument, every word clipped and urgent. "Move it!"


Apparently, the sponsors had hit a dead end with Charles and gone straight to Napier for answers.


"I got it, Grandpa. I'll head back right away," Charles answered, ending the call and snatching up his car keys.


He glanced at the group. "I'll video call you from my other phone. Gotta deal with my grandpa first."



Everyone murmured their understanding.



Without wasting a second, Charles rushed out the door.



For now, he could stall the sponsors-at least until Napier had smoothed things over and the Evans family's clout could be brought to bear.



But another storm loomed overhead: the program review.



There had been incidents before-once a celebrity's reputation came under fire, their scenes might get quietly cut, or in the worst-case scenario, the entire show could be scrapped.



The sponsors would be weighing all those risks right now.



Millie paused, calculating her next move, and then turned to Alexia. "Mind if I borrow your laptop?"



Alexia slid it over without hesitation.



Millie's hands flew over the keys, pulling Alexia and Seville into her mission.



She refused to go it alone-this fight would take all of them.



After a second's thought, Millie turned to Sheridan."Sorry if it gets noisy."



Sheridan had complained about the chaos before,but now he just gave a dismissive wave, eyes glued to Alexia's screen. Noise or not, he was in.



Once the discussion ended, Sheridan focused on coding the program he'd mentioned earlier.



"You should really pull your SIM card. Vivian will jump at any excuse to leak your number," he added softly.



Vivian,true to form, had already set that trap.
Millie's phone was buzzing nonstop with spam and insulting messages.



Millie popped out Serena's SIM card and slipped it into her bag.



Since Evans Entertainment had set up that number under their own name, there was no risk of it being traced to Millie's personal details. With the card gone,the constant buzz of messages and calls finally ceased.



She glanced around the living room, meeting everyone's eyes. "Let's get back to work."



"Yes!"



"That's right!"



By now, dusk had settled outside. Any news of blacklisting or program cancellation wouldn't come until morning, once offices reopened and meetings began.



For tonight, at least, the storm was held at bay.







Meanwhile,at Vivian Floral Design,Vivian stood alone at her window, watching as Brandon's taillights vanished down the street. She glanced down at the messages she'd just sent Serena, a bitter, trembling smile twisting her lips as she wiped at tears threatening to spill.



So much had changed during this single taping.Somewhere along the line,she realized, she'd stopped attacking and started defending-never sure what blow might land next.



By her calculations, Serena should have lost this round.Yet somehow, a hidden hand had tipped the scales,forcing Vivian to hold back and conserve her energy for the finals.



She'd planned to unleash the "donation fraud"scandal at the climax-blindsiding Serena just as Serena's team had done to her recently.



But with the rumor mill now in overdrive, Vivian had no choice but to up the ante. She dropped the bombshell ahead of schedule, hoping to bury the chaos under something even bigger.



Vivian let out a cold murmur. "So what if I played my hand early? Serena, your name is nowhere on that donation list. Even if you scramble to make it up now,everyone online will see straight through it-too little,too late. Your wholesome act is finished. Let's see you claw your way out of this."



Her caregiver standing nearby couldn't resist speaking up."But Miss Simpson... your name doesn't appear on the list either. What if someone brings that up?"



Vivian shot her a scathing look and snapped, "Are you fucking dumb? The whole world saw Brandon buy that tanzanite for me, and it wasn't cheap. Plus, I'm also wearing the ruby pendant he bought for all to see.Who cares if my name isn't listed?"



The caregiver fell silent, biting back a retort.


She'd nearly pointed out that, legally, Brandon and Millie were still married-which technically made that jewelry part of their joint property-but she thought better of it. One more word and she'd face another sharp reprimand.
###Chapter 110 An Outsider In His Own Life
As an elite caregiver, she had cared for many high-profile individuals and was well aware that the heads of major corporations often had prenuptial agreements to protect their assets in high-stakes marriages.Given that Brandon's wife had no notable background or leverage, the risk of a costly divorce was virtually nonexistent. So, she chose not to bring it up.




··.



Brandon sat in the back seat of the car.He pulled out his phone and called Eugene.



"Mr.Watson," Eugene answered promptly.



"There's something I need you to take care of,"Brandon said, outlining the details.



"Understood, Mr. Watson. I'll begin preparing the materials right away."



After ending the call, Brandon fell silent, lost in thought



"Where to, sir?" the driver asked.
"Just drive around," Brandon said quietly.



He didn't want to go back to the apartment.



Serenity Villa no longer felt like home since Millie had moved out. Without her, it was just an empty house.


Moonlit Estate wasn't an option either. His grandparents still refused to see him.


And Millie's place... was closed off to him now.



Brandon gazed out the window,taking in the glittering city lights. The nightscape was as dazzling as ever,but he felt disconnected from it all.



Despite being at the top of Crobert's social and financial ladder, he suddenly felt like an outsider in his own life.



What was happening to him?



He leaned back in his seat and rubbed his temples, the weight of conflicting emotions pressing down on him.



The driver continued to cruise through the city in silence. Brandon stared absently out the window.



Shop fronts passed by. Bright displays flickered besides crowded sidewalks. It was lively. Then something caught his eye.

"Stop here," Brandon said.



He stepped into a nearby mall. His gaze was drawn to racks of little girls' dresses, colorful stationery,backpacks, and art supplies.



He imagined Ari in one of those dresses-she would look lovely.



He remembered her passion for drawing, the quiet intensity she showed, and the genuine promise in her work.



With proper support, she could become a true artist.


Guided by impulse, Brandon began selecting items.



His presence didn't go unnoticed, but when the staff approached,he simply gestured for them not to make a scene.



He picked out several dresses, art materials, and school supplies, and then paid and had everything packed neatly.



When he returned to the car, the driver looked surprised but said nothing.



"To the Crobert Children's Home," Brandon instructed.



The car pulled away smoothly.
As he held the bags beside him, Brandon felt an unexpected sense of peace.



He wanted to see Ari. To bring her gifts.To make her feel cherished.



Soon, they arrived. Brandon spoke with the director and arranged a short visit in a designated meeting area.



After a brief wait, Ari appeared, slowly making her way toward him with a plush puppy toy clutched in her arms.



She didn't say anything. She simply sat on a nearby chair.



They sat in silence for a while.


Then Brandon spoke up first. "I brought you something."



He placed the bags on the table and showed her one of the dresses.



Ari looked at the dress briefly. "Thank you, sir," she said politely, "but I don't need it."


Unfazed, Brandon gently moved the dress aside and brought out the backpack and art supplies.



"I saw your drawing at the kindergarten last time," he said. "You're really talented." He laid the items out carefully.


Ari looked at him but didn't reach for anything.



"You can give them to other kids here," she said.



Brandon studied her small face, unsure how to respond.



Ari spoke again, softly but clearly. "My mom will buy the things I need. And even if she's busy,Alexia and Charles will help. I'm only staying here because the paperwork isn't finalized yet."



She lifted her plush toy slightly. "Look, Alexia gave this to me. I really like it."


"If you like it, I can buy you more," Brandon offered.


Ari didn't answer. She just held the toy tightly and looked at him.



Then she said, "Sir, don't you understand? I only accept things from my mom and her friends. I don't take things from anyone else."


In that modest children's home,she looked small and delicate, but there was strength in her voice, a quiet resolve that reminded him of Millie.



"Please go back," she said gently. "Don't come Looking for me anymore."
Brandon remained still, his hands clenched beneath the table.



"You must know about my relationship with Millie," he said. "If you call her 'Mom,' then you should call me 'Dad.' There's nothing wrong with accepting these gifts from me. It's what I should do. I'm not sure if your mother told you about me... but as my daughter,there's nothing in Crobert you couldn't have."


He smiled softly. "I can help cure your illness, and support your dreams Just..."


Brandon paused, feeling a fragile vulnerability he'd never experienced before. His eyes reddened slightly,but he kept his composure. "All I ask," he said, "is that you call me 'Dad.'"


Ari looked at him steadily, her expression unreadable.



Then,finally,she asked, "But are you?"


Brandon stiffened slightly. She had seen his eyes, his hesitation. She understood. He wanted to know if Millie had put her up to this.


Ari gently tugged at her toy's ears. "Sir," she said, "my mom is an amazing person. Before you came to me last time, she hadn't said a word about you. You forced her to reveal who you are. She didn't want to upset me, so she only said you were her husband.
Then I asked Alexia, but she wouldn't tell me anything either. It was only after I asked the director for help that I learned more about you."


Her gaze met his, clear and unwavering. "I know there's someone named Vivian in your life. Every time I search your name, she comes up, not my mom. If she's the person you've chosen, then maybe it's best if you stay with her."



Her voice remained calm, but her words struck deep."Just... don't hurt my mom again." 
###Chapter 111 You Are Not My Father
Brandon closed his eyes, the weight in his chest tightening. It took several long seconds for him to swallow the ache and speak up again.



"Ari," he said quietly, "things between Vivian and me..they're not what you think."


But Ari just looked at him with those large, searching eyes, making his heart sink further.



"I don't know how to explain it to you since it's too complicated," he said, voice softer now. "But one day,you'll understand. Both of you and your mom will.There's a pretty tanzanite in the safe at home-your mother liked it a lot. I'll have a jeweler design something beautiful from it, just for you."



"No," Ari replied. "I'm my mother's daughter. You're not my father. I don't want jewelry or anything from you. You don't need to show me how rich you are.I already know. But I love my mom."



She was not yet five, but her words cut with clarity and purpose.



She slid down from the chair,clutching her plushie.Its soft ears flapped with the motion.



"Please don't come see me again," she said, turning away. "I need to go back to sleep."



Brandon stood, but he didn't follow. Instead, he called out, "Just this once-please accept the gifts. They were chosen with you in mind."



Ari paused and turned back slightly, her lips pressed tight. "Sir, I told you. You can give them to someone else."



"They'll be yours. Once you have them, you can do whatever you want," Brandon said.



"| already said," Ari insisted. "They belong to you.1don't want them. Are you trying to force a child,sir?"



Brandon let out a quiet sigh. "That's not what I mean."



He only wanted to be kind to her.


But Ari didn't say anything else. She just looked at him.



The director of the facility, who had been standing quietly by the doorway, stepped in. Her eyes were disapproving as she looked at Brandon.


One of the staff members came forward to guide Ari back to her room, while the director lingered. She stared as Brandon watched Ari go, his lips drawn in a tight line.


"You should head back, Mr. Watson," the director said."We'll look after her."



Brandon didn't answer right away. He lowered his head slightly, letting his fringe fall across his eyes.



He then reached into his coat and pulled out a checkbook, scribbled something quickly, and handed the check to the director.



"A donation," he said. "For the children here. Use it how you see fit."



The director hesitated but then accepted it. Despite her opinion of Brandon, the money was much needed.



"These other things..." Brandon gestured toward the untouched gift bags. "See if any of the children can use them."



The director nodded.



"Don't tell them who it came from," Brandon added."And keep her safe."



The director nodded again."We will."



"I'm leaving," Brandon murmured-not to anyone in particular. He then turned and walked off into the night.
...



The city spun on,loud and fast.



Charles was racing toward Evans Mansion.



He had multiple phones stuffed into his coat. One had a video call still running with Millie and the team,another was pulling updates from the mansion, and everything else was vibrating constantly.



His head was starting to throb.



Several investors from the show were already on their way. Millie had come up with a smart solution,but the real trouble wasn't those investors. It was his brothers.Both of them had made it there first.



Inside the Evans family, Charles was finally starting to gain ground. But his two brothers weren't going to hand over control without a fight.


Still, seeing Millie and the others on the video call-shuffling papers, tracking updates, coordinating their plan-it grounded him.


He had to stay strong and win this. No matter what.


This was his one shot to flip the script-something Millie had made possible. If he failed now, he'd stay the underdog forever.

He leaned forward, urging the driver to speed up,too focused to notice the car that slipped past them.







At the same time, Millie and her team were deep in paperwork,sorting through document after document.After what felt like endless hours, they finally confirmed everything they needed.



Only then did the tension in the room ease slightly



Millie checked the time. 3 a.m.



"Thank you all so much," she said, her voice warm with gratitude.



"No trouble at all," Seville replied with a relaxed smile."This is what we're here for."



It wasn't entirely out of kindness-Charles had already recognized his skills and brought him into Evans Entertainment with a generous offer.



But since the whole situation was still in a delicate phase, that news hadn't been made public yet.



Alexia had received her reward from Charles too. She was now curled up on the couch, hugging her brand-new Prada handbag from the latest collection,grinning. "I got my bag. Doing some work in return?
That's totally fair."



But Millie knew the difference between helping because it was your job and helping because you cared.



Seville was a seasoned collector of action figures-lots of them were even rare,limited editions. Alexia?She was the daughter of Crobert Hospital's director.Neither of them had financial problems. They had poured their time and energy into this for Millie simnply because they cared.



Millie didn't say anything more. But she made a quiet note in her heart to treat them sincerely in return.



"Millie, what's next?" Alexia asked, mid-yawn.



Seville listened in as he placed a late-night snack order.



Millie didn't look away from the screen. "Vivian's own tactics can be used to push back against her."



"I don't follow," Alexia said, slumping deeper into the sofa.



Millie stopped typing for a second, glanced up, and smiled. "A show that inspires people and conveys a positive,uplifting message won't be shut down, right?And Vivian's public image is all about being brave and inspiring."
Alexia blinked,still puzzled.



Millie handed her a pillow to lean on and continued,"She's the one who said she wants the public to see the last months of her life to encourage those who suffer just like her. That makes her sound generous,doesn't it?"



"So we're using her own message to respond?" Alexia mumbled.



Millie nodded.



Their concern now wasn't just the donation fraud scandal-it was the risk of the wwhole program being shut down.



But most cancellations only happened when the negative impact was clear and immediate.



Heavenly Melody had launched on the strength of Vivian's appeal, and the audience had only shifted focus much later to talk about the talent, the competition, the music.



And up until now, Serena hadn't had a single public scandal.



Even this supposed scandal was murky. There was no confirmation yet. Those higher-ups in charge knew how this industry worked-nothing was ever as simple as it looked.



With the show's overall message being hopeful and socially positive, canceling it outright wouldn't be their first option.



Their research had also shown that in similar situations,the common solution was to quietly edit out the controversial individuals.



Besides, the authorities wouldn't make a snap decision.There would be meetings, discussions, protocol.



And with their document submission, they had officially flagged their interest in an internal investigation-and requested a final deadline before the last livestream aired.



The decision-makers would want proper evidence,which bought them precious, much-needed time to handle things.



"If it gets too bad, I'll just reveal my identity," Millie said, hitting the Enter key to send a file to Charles."But I don't think we'll have to go that far."



Other matters were being taken care of by staff at Evans Entertainment, who were now liaising directly with the right departments.


The delay strategy was now mostly set.
All that was left... was to finalize her divorce from Brandon.
###Chapter 112 Loyalty



Millie glanced at the others and said, "I think we've done enough for today."



She decided to finish up on her own.



Exhausted,the rest of the group said their goodbyes and headed out.



When Millie finally got home, it was already late.



Worried that she might not wake up in time to take Ari to school the following day, she set several alarms,just to be safe. Afterward, she drifted off into a deep sleep.







Meanwhile, Charles managed to slip past his brothers and relay Millie's plan to Napier.



Napier didn't respond right away. He just scrutinized his grandson, leaving Charles squirming under the weight of his silence.



"Grandpa, why are you staring at me like that?"Charles asked uneasily. "Did I say something wrong?"


Napier's face was unreadable as he took a seat. This only made Charles more anxious.



What did that look mean? Was it bad?



Sweat began to form on his brow.



"I just don't understand why she chose you," Napier finally said, shaking his head as he gave Charles a slow once-over."You barely look put together, you've got a hot temper, and compared to your brothers, you were never the skilled one. You act on impulse far too often.So why you?"



Charles felt a jolt of irritation. "Barely put together"?


That was ridiculous. He was good-looking, and he knew it.



His father had a thing for attractive women,and those good looks didn't skip a generation.



He was frequently in the gossip columns, linked to various actresses, and had even topped the list of the most eligible bachelors.



Moreover, ever since he'd started spending more time with Millie, Charles had worked hard to rein in his temper.



But this was his grandfather he was facing, so he wouldn't dare talk back.
Still, he couldn't help feeling wronged.



Napier caught the frustration in his eyes and let out a snort.



Charles lowered his gaze. "Grandpa..."



Napier let out a heavy sigh and spoke with a calm but firm tone. "You should really think about why she picked you. That girl is sharp and resilient. Even when backed into a corner, she always finds a way to strike back. Every move she's made so far has been deliberate and well-executed. If it weren't for the divorce process with Brandon that prevents her from revealing her true identity, Vivian wouldn't even come close to matching her. And truthfully, I don't think she even sees Vivian as a rival. She knows exactly what she's doing."



Then Napier added sincerely, "You're her friend now But what if one day she stood on the opposite side?Would that scare you? At the charity gala, she owned the room. And now again, look at what she has pulled off. It's not just luck. It's raw talent. She's perfectly capable on her own. So the question is, why you?"



Charles hadn't seen that question coming.



Honestly, he'd never given it much thought.



To him, it had just felt natural. Millie chose him, and they ended up working side by side.


"Grandpa..." Charles paused,trying to piece together a reasonable answer. "Maybe it's because we used to sell songs together under a secret alias? We were friends, and then this show just came along?"



Exasperated, Napier tapped Charles on the head with his cane.



"Ouch, Grandpa! That hurts!" Charles yelped, rubbing the sore spot and looking thoroughly wronged.



Napier shook his head with a sigh. "What do you mean selling songs under a secret alias?"



Charles went on to explain how he had helped Millie sell songs under the alias "Eva" after she married Brandon and stepped away from the spotlight.



"She didn't really make much from it," he added in a lower tone. "Back then, she was Brandon's wife, and he gave her whatever she needed. It couldn't have been about the money."



Napier looked at Charles with irritation. "And here l thought you'd finally gotten smarter. Guess | was wrong."



Seeing the confusion on his grandson's face, he continued, "I think I know why she chose you. It's because she values genuine loyalty and emotional bonds."



He paused, as if reflecting on something. "She stayed with Brandon all those years most likely because she felt bound by loyalty."



"It's a shame..." Napier shook his head.



Charles frowned. "Why would that be a bad thing?Isn't loyalty a good thing?"



Napier gave Charles a long, deep look without responding.


"I see one of your better traits now," Napier said,changing the subject. "Sincerity."


Charles blinked. Was that a compliment, or a way of calling him naive?



Charles had always been the blunt type, quick to speak and even quicker to lose his temper.



But lately, he'd started learning to be more cunning.



The thought made him grin in satisfaction.



"Tomorrow morning at seven, the investor reps will be arriving. Figure out how you're going to manage things before then," Napier said before turning to head to his room.
"Wait, Grandpa. So did I pass your test or not?"Charles called after him.



Napier didn't reply. But if he hadn't passed...would they still be having this conversation?







Millie woke up just in time.



Her head felt heavy from lack of sleep, but she dragged herself to the bathroom and washed up.



After getting dressed in a hurry, she poured herself a cup of coffee, and then headed out to pick Ari up from the Children's Home.



While waiting at a red light, Millie glanced down at her phone.



It was already 7:30 a.m. She opened the group chat and scrolled through the messages.



The others were probably still asleep. The last message came from Charles from the night before-"I've handled my grandpa."



She wondered if that 7 a.m. meeting he mentioned was still in progress.



He had relayed his conversation with his grandfather the previous night.
Millie realized that setting the meeting for 7 in the morning was probably Napier's way of giving Charles a chance to figure things out overnight



It was also a way to deliver results just before the investors officially started their day.



As she pondered this, a new message from Charles popped up. "Sorted."



She hadn't even typed a reply when another followed."But... I didn't getto use that reason we prepared."


Millie's brow furrowed. What was going on?



She sent Charles a message, asking if they could talk on the phone.



He called her instantly.



Millie wore her Bluetooth earbuds before accepting the call.



"Charles, what's going on?" she asked, genuinely confused.



Had the investors rejected their plan? Did Charles have to come up with something else to convince them?



What could he have said?
Millie tried to piece it together but came up blank.



"It's too much to explain right now," Charles said quickly. "The investors are still around. I need to get them settled first. Let's talk at the office later." Before she could say another word, he ended the call.



Millie sat in silence, momentarily stunned.



Just then, the traffic light turned green, and Millie started the car.



Once her car was steadily on the road, she reminded herself not to get too caught up in speculation. First,she had to get Ari to kindergarten. Everything else could wait.



With that in mind, Millie turned on the car radio,hoping some music would help clear her thoughts.


The voice of the morning host came through the speakers. "Good morning, listeners. Today is..."



Millie glanced at the date on her phone.



It was the 28th day since she and Brandon filed their divorce.
###Chapter 113 A Kiss On The Cheek
Millie took a slow breath and decided not to overthink it. First, she needed to pick up Ari and get her to kindergarten before they ran late.



Charles still had some loose ends to tie up,but he had already texted saying everything was handled-no need for her to stress.



That made her feel lighter, at least a little. She drove off to collect Ari.


But when she arrived, something felt... off.


Ari looked like she had something on her mind.


And the director of the children's home seemed hesitant too-like she wanted to say something but kept it in.



Millie glanced from Ari to the director, giving them space to speak.



But neither of them did.



And so, Millie said nothing either. She figured if they wanted to keep it private, she'd respect that.
"Shall we go?" she asked gently.


Ari nodded. Millie smiled and slung the little backpack over her shoulder. They walked out together.


Just before heading into the kindergarten gates, Ari tugged at Millie's sleeve. "Will you be picking me up this afternoon?" she asked.



Usually, Millie was the one who picked her up. If she couldn't, she always made sure it was someone Ari liked-Alexia or her brother, Sheridan or his brother,or sometimes Charles.



Ari didn't usually ask. But since she did today, Millie could tell she wanted her to come today.


She bent down to meet the girl's eyes, gentlypressing a hand to her soft, chubby cheek.


"I'll do my best," she said softly. "And if I really can't,I'll come visit you tonight. I promise you'll still see me,okay?"



Ari's face lit up. Her eyes curved into little crescent moons, and she nodded eagerly. Then she turned to go. But after just a few steps, she spun around, ran back, and planted a kiss on Millie's cheek before dashing into the building with a skip in her step.


Millie touched the spot where the kiss had landed, a quiet smile spreading across her face.


Things between her and Ari were shifting-growing deeper, warmer. She felt the warmth.


After making sure Ari was safely inside,Millie headed to Evans Entertainment.



By eight-thirty, she had parked outside the building She adjusted her disguise, pulled her mask higher, and made her way up.



Ever since she and Charles had been spotted together on camera and gossips went wild, she'd learned to be more cautious.



She entered through a side entrance and headed straight for the most private meeting room. Only after she was inside did she finally remove the mask.



A voice message from Charles buzzed through her phone. "I'll be there around nine."



Millie nodded to herself and opened her notebook to start sketching.



There were still plans to go over for the Heavenly Melody finale.



She lost track of time in her sketches until the door finally opened. She looked up. Charles walked in.
His face was clouded. He closed the door and sat down across from her without a word.



"What is it?" Millie asked, sensing something was off.


He didn't answer immediately. His fingers tapped lightly against the table. As though he was carefully weighing his words.



Millie blinked. That alone was surprising.



Charles usually spoke before he thought. She studied him. What could have happened?



Not able to hold it back, she asked him directly.



"I can think too, you know!" Charles snapped, clearly irritated. Last night,his grandfather had basically called him brainless.



The memory of it still boiled his blood. And now Millie did the same?



"Okay, fine," he muttered. "I'll just say it." He let out a sigh. "This morning, at the Evans family..."



Two hours earlier, over at the Watson Mansion,Charles had been doing everything he could to stay under the radar.



Every time his brothers showed up, something went wrong.
Those two wolves never missed a chance to stir up trouble-and right now, they saw an opening.



They were now doing everything they could to pressure investors into forcing Serena-Evans Entertainment's own talent-out of the show. It was their best shot.



Sure, the company could still make money off the show since they're a major investor, but Serena's image, her career, her future endorsements-all of it would be wiped out.



The show mattered. But it wasn't the core issue. The bigger win was Serena's future potential. Brand deals,ambassador roles-that was the long game.



If Serena got cancelled, all of Charles' work would go up in flames. And that was their real endgame.


So of course these two brothers were seizing this moment to corner Charles, throwing around sly remarks and whispering offers behind closed doors.All of it designed to make himn lose ground.



Napier, meanwhile, stayed on the sidelines.


He didn't care about the mess. His plan from the beginning had always been to let them fight it out. If it got ugly, well-that was their problem.
Once everyone had arrived, Charles straightened his jacket and walked into the meeting room,ready to speak.



The room was packed withinvestors and executives from all corners. Most of them had ties to his brothers.Even though Millie had won Napier over last time,Charles knew that wasn't enough. He still had work to do to win the others.



"Mr. Evans," someone said sharply as soon as Charles stepped in. "We called you several times last night. No reply. Today, we need an answer."



"Exactly. This project doesn't belong to you alone. If it fails, we all lose. And that's not something you can just ignore."



"I messaged you already. There's a simple solution-remove Serena. Clean cut. Plenty of shows have done it."



"Right. Replace the problematic figure and the rest goes forward. It's standard. And we've dropped A-listers before. This isn't personal-simply damage control."



Voices piled over each other. One suggestion after another. All of them pushingthe same agenda.


Charles clenched his jaw, frustrated.
The suggestions weren't new. They were standard,yes -but not all of them came from a place of reason.Some were just eager to watch him fall. He was fully aware.


If not for Millie's plan, he would've been eaten alive in this room.



Charles cleared his throat, preparing to speak. But before he could get a word out, a sharp tap echoed through the room.



Jayceon leaned forward."Alright,everyone,give me a minute." He tucked his phone into his pocket and stood.



The Elliott family was one of Crobert's big three names, and unlike the fractured Evans family, the Elliotts had unity on their side. No one interrupted and all just stare at Jayceon.


"I'm here to speak on behalf of the Elliott family,"he said. "About Serena's situation."



Every head turned, eyes shifting to Charles.



Everyone knew the Elliott Group had signed on as sponsors just two days ago. And now, this? They would definitely want to understand what was going on.
If Jayceon turned against Charles right here, it would be the final blow. With the full table of investors watching, that kind of public disapproval would sink everything.



Everyone watched Charles with eager anticipation.



Charles' brothers looked thrilled. They leaned back in their seats, smug and certain.



After all, the timing of the Elliott sponsorship had made one thing clear-it wasn't a deal Charles had arranged. There'd been no personal negotiation,so why would the Elliotts forsake their interests and side with Charles now?



Jayceon took a breath and began to speak.
###Chapter 114 What Secret Did She Hide Behind Her...
Jayceon's voice rang out, steady and clear."We see nothing wrong with Serena. Our sponsorship remains,no matter what."



A stunned hush swept through the meeting room.



Spectators who'd been expecting Charles to squirm were left completely dumbfounded.



Charles' two brothers cast uneasy glances in Jayceon's direction, brows furrowed in surprise.



Oakley couldn't hold back. "Are you sure about this,Jayceon? Did you even run it by Myron?"



That jolted Charles from his shock. He shot Oakley a warning glare. "Enough! He's speaking. Keep quiet!"



Oakley bristled, his battered face tight with irritation,ready to fire back.



Jayceon cut the tension, already growing impatient."Let's not drag this out. I know exactly what I'm saying The Elliott family stands behind Serena, so there's no reason for her to drop out. And honestly, we put money behind this campaign exactly because we saw  her potentials. If she's gone, what happens to our money?"



Across the table, Reuben Evans exchanged a look with his associate, who finally voiced what others were thinking. "You're a huge Serena fan as far as we know,Mr. Elliott,but business isn't about personal favorites.Don't think you can steamroll your brother."



Frustration boiled over. Jayceon's hand smacked the table.



"Excuse me? You think I'm acting on my own, ignoring my brother's opinion?" He rose, commanding the room's attention. "Tell you what! All three of us discussed this. Our families are in agreement!"



His eyes scanned the assembly, defiant. "And yes, 1admire Serena. I'll say it straight-I stand by her, and so does the entire Elliott family. She stays in the competition,our partnership continues, and we'll keep backing her growth. But if she leaves, we're out, no matter how much hype Heavenly Melody gets!"



That left no room for doubt.



Despite Serena's absence, Heavenly Melody was still trending, with plenty of commercial interest riding on the other contestants.



Among the judges, Alex had quickly become a standout.
Charles found himself speechless, but kept his thoughts to himself for now.



The room's energy shifted again as theWatson Group representative rapped the table. "Mr. Watson sent me today. Our stance is clear-Serena isn't leaving, and Watson Group fully supports her."



That declaration sent a ripple through the crowd.



Suddenly,speculation replaced shock.


In Crobert, real power belonged to three giants: Watson Group, Evans Group, and Elliott Group.It was no secret that the Evans brothers were fighting each other, and while Charles stood with Serena,his brothers refused to align.



Now,with the Elliott family publicly in Serena's corner and Watson Group showing no opposition, the balance of power was shifting.



Clearly, there was more going on beneath the surface than anyone had guessed.



The Watson Group's representative wasn't finished."One more message from Mr. Watson," he announced."If any sponsors decide to pull out over this, Watson Group will pick up every share they drop."


Jayceon shot up in protest. "Hey, that's my line! Myron made it clear, the Elliott Group is in too!"



A competitive spark lit his eyes. "Throw every available share our way. We're ready to take on the lot!"



This declaration sent a ripple of unease through the investor reps. Phones lit up across the table as everyone scrambled to check with their home offices,searching for guidance or some hidden piece of the puzzle.



Initially, the Elliott Group hadn't backed the competition in the first three rounds. Their attention on Serena only intensified during the latest stage.



The big question: what changed in round three?Serena's fame had skyrocketed; her talent was plain for all to see.



The conclusion was simple-her commercial potential had caught the Elliott Group's eye. Jayceon's personal admiration likely played a smaller part.



When it came to Brandon, no one believed it had anything to do with being love-struck over Serena. It was clear to everyone he sponsored the show for Vivian's sake, and besides, Serena was Charles 'girlfriend. That just didn't make sense.



Meanwhile, Watson Group's rep looked determined to scoop up any dropped shares.
All signs pointed to a simple truth: both companies saw value in Serena and Heavenly Melody that went beyond surface hype.


With some thought, the logic became clear.



The potential tied up in Serena and the show was bigger than most could see right now. Something was happening behind the scenes, something only a few understood.



Any talk of Serena dropping out vanished. The possibility of forfeited shares disappeared too. The game would go on, unchanged for now.


Still, an air of mystery lingered over the gathering.


Who exactly was Serena, that three corporate giants in town were practically all fighting to keep her? What secret did she hide behind her mask?



Charles scanned the room, sharp-eyed and restless.



Just like that, the whole argument had fizzled out.


Later, at Evans Entertainment, Charles was nearly doubled over with laughter, hand pounding the desk.


"You had to see my brothers' faces! Like they'd just swallowed a mouthful of nails. Bet they spent days lining up allies, but when it mattered, everyone turned their backs. All their careful favors meant nothing.The whole thing was a rush!"



While Charles reveled in the moment, Millie sat quietly,lost in her own thoughts.



There was something deeper going on. She could understand the Elliott family's earlier moves, but this time, she couldn't explain their fierce defense of Serena.Why fight so hard for someone whose identity they didn't even know?



Puzzlement gnawed at Millie.



Also,what was driving Brandon's actions? His motives made less sense by the day.



He had been the first to champion Vivian, spreading the word and making her the focus. Now,unexpectedly, he was the one ensuring Serena stayed in the running.



Unable to keep her questions bottled up, Millie gave voice to her doubts.



Wiping away tears of laughter, Charles met her gaze with a knowing nod.



"I've been just as baffled, to be honest," he admitted,reaching for a folder and laying it between them. "But take a look-l managed to get my hands on something just before I got here."
The papers slid across the table to Millie.



A quick scan revealed details that echoed the strategy Millie had outlined the previous night, her plan for countering Vivian's moves.



A furrow creased her brow. "Was there a problem? Did they reject it?"



Charles shook his head, eyes serious now. "Watson Group actually submitted this to the authorities before we did."



What?



Surprise flickered in Millie's eyes.



"Our people tried to hand in the report this morning,but they were told Watson Group had already staked their claim on the show." Charles tapped the file for emphasis. "One of our contacts from the inside managed to get a copy. It's just a piece of the Watson Group's larger plan. Plus, there's more going on behind the scenes. What we've heard is, the show isn't in danger of being axed for now."



Each new detail only made Millie's frown deepen.None of it added up.



Charles leaned back, lost in thought. "Honestly,I used to think Brandon was just being difficult; almost  seemed like he was sabotaging himself. But then another piece fell into place."


He handed her a second document.



"After the third live show, Brandon's team reached out with an offer-compensation for Eva's silence.But the truth was, they just wanted her to keep quiet about the fact that Vivian didn't actually write Glimmer of Love." Charles shrugged. "I refused, of course. Maybe this time around, he's just brokering deals."



A half-smile then played at Charles' lips."Or maybe it's just guilt-maybe he feels he owes you, after everything that's happened."
###Chapter 115 The 30th Day
Millie studied the document in front of her.



Whatever Brandon was trying to achieve,compensate her or buy her silence, it didn't matter. It wouldn't change anything she had planned.



"I don't know what's going on with the Elliott family,though.Ask them when you have a chance, maybe?"Charles thought for a while and added, "Maybe it's just because Jayceon's a hardcore fan. You might want to send him a few more autographs."



Millie gave no response.



She might look into the Elliott situation later, but right now, only two things mattered.


Getting ready for the finals of Heavenly Melody and ending her marriage to Brandon once and for all.


Her schedule for the day was packed.



She reinserted Serena's SIM card into her phone.



Sheridan had already installed a blocking system, so harassing messages and prankcalls were no longer a problem.
Still, her inbox had been filled with qulestions from people fishing for information about her connection to both the Watson and Elliott Groups. She ignored every single one.



The hours slipped by before she knew it.


That afternoon, Millie headed out to pick Ari up from school.



She spotted the girl easily in the sea of uniforms. Ari had seen her too and was already making her way over, smiling brightly.



Millie bent down to hug her.



"Millie!" Ari beamed.


"Yes, sweetheart!" Millie brushed the dust off Ari's sleeves, smoothing out her clothes.



"Are you hungry? Want some snacks?" she asked playfully, giving her cheek a light pinch. "Anything but -



"Ice cream!" they both said at once, bursting into laughter.



Ari couldn't eat ice cream for health reasons.



It had become a running joke between them,one that showed just how in tune they were lately.
Once she'd tidied Ari up, Millie brought her over to a nearby gazebo and handed her the water bottle.


Ari had something on her mind. She'd been thinking about Brandon's visit the night before.


"Millie, can I ask you a question?" she asked, finally deciding to speak.



Millie took the bottle from her and gave her full attention.



She'd had a feeling this was coming.



Ari took a breath, and then asked carefully,"Do you still have feelings for Brandon?"



Millie didn't know why Ari would ask that, but her answer came easily. "I don't."



Ari looked visibly relieved. Millie couldn't help but let out a soft laugh.



"What's wrong?" she asked gently.


Ari looked down. "He came to visit last night. He brought me a bunch of gifts, but I didn't accept any of them." She paused, recalling the events of the previous night, and then added, "Afterward, I heard the director saying he made a huge donation."



Millie's brows tightened as she listened.
Brandon had shown up to see Ari last night?


A breeze drifted past, stirring the quiet afternoon. Not far away, a sleek Maybach pulled up and came to a stop.



Inside the back seat, Brandon caught sight of Millie and Ari near the gazebo.


Through the slightly open window, Ari's soft voice reached him-clear, uncertain, but sincere.



"I told Brandon you didn't like him anymore and asked him to stop making you sad," she said in a small voice."I also told him not to visit me again... that he's not my father."


Looking at Millie timidly, she asked, "Millie, are you angry with me for saying that?"



Millie gave her a warm smile and pinched her cheek."Of course not. Why would I be?"



She held Ari's small hands in hers. "Don't worry about it. Want me to make beef stew for dinner? I just found a new recipe online and clearly you can plate the food creatively to shape cute little animals. Sound good?"


"Yes,please!" Ari beamed. She always looked forward to Millie's cooking.
With their dinner plan settled, they walked back to the car.



Soon,they were on the road, heading home together.



"Should we tail them, sir?" Eugene asked from the front seat.



Brandon slowly shook his head.



He wasn't even sure why he had come. Maybe just to see Millie again, even if only from afar. But he was painfully aware that she didn't want to see him.


She was still hurt.


Ari's words hung in the silence, leaving a dull ache in his chest.


Millie hadn't refuted them.



And then there was the stew.



She hadn't made it for him in so long.



Back then, no matter how late he came home, she'd be waiting, always with a warm meal ready.



She'd always given him a sense of comfort.



Now...
Brandon shut his eyes.



It was like those memories belonged to another life.



"How much longer until the divorce would be finalized?"he asked quietly.



Eugene didn't need to think. "Today makes twenty-eight days, sir. In two more, the decree can be finalized."



Brandon said nothing. Eugene glanced at him in the rearview mirror, and then asked cautiously, "Are you...reconsidering things?"



Brandon's eyes opened. He met Eugene's reflection without a word.



The look was enough. Eugene quickly shifted his eyes forward.



"My apologies, sir. I shouldn't have asked."


Brandon let the comment go without reproach,returning his attention to the view outside.



The street near the kindergarten was full of movement-parents greeting their children with wide smiles and open arms.



He watched them, something stirring quietly inside.
"How long have you been working with me now,Eugene?" he asked.



"Since you took over the company at twenty-two.That makes six years," Eugene responded immediately



Six years.


And Millie... she'd been by his side for seven.


Seven long years. Thousands of days. Countless nights.





Brandon rested his head slightly against the window,expression unreadable.



"Let's head to that beef stew place you mentioned before," he said.



"Yes, sir." Eugene turned the key and drove off.







Elsewhere, Millie's car pulled into the neighborhood.


Through the rearview mirror, she watched Ari deep in concentration, carefully piecing together a puzzle.A small smile touched her lips. That quiet, content moment was all she needed.



Although Ari still called her "Millie" now, she believed that,someday, the girl would feel ready to say "Mom."
After all, the girl only called her "Miss Bennett" at first.


The thought warmed her, but it also reminded her-she needed to make things clear to Brandon again.He had no right to involve himself with Ari.


That child was hers and hers alone-he had no place in her life.



After bringing Ari home, Millie prepared a warm,hearty dinner.



The kitchen filled with laughter as they cooked together.



Across town, Brandon had visited nearly every top-rated restaurant in Crobert, sampling their beef stew one by one. Yet, none of them tasted the way he remembered.



He stared at the bowl in front of him.



Was something wrong with his taste buds?



Food shouldn't vary that much.



Even made by different hands, the ingredients were similar and the flavor should be close.



Eventually, Brandon lowered his spoon.



Something wasn't right with him these days.
Maybe it was time to see a therapist.




···



The days crept by.



The 28th day since they filed the divorce slipped past quietly.



Then the 29th came and went-ordinary, filled with errands and tasks.



That night, Millie returned home from the practice room,drained from a long rehearsal session.



She took a shower, changed into her pajamas, and glanced at the clock. It was just after midnight.


The 30th day had begun. In less than twenty-four hours, her marriage to Brandon would be officially over.
###Chapter 116 You Are Missing Millie,Aren't You
Millie tried not to let her worries take over,silently wishing for an uneventful day ahead.



She checked her phone, but the blank screen offered no comfort-no new notifications, no missed calls,not even a stray message from anyone she cared about.



Letting out a quiet sigh, she decided not to dwell on it and set her phone aside, curling up and willing herself to sleep.



Across the city, Vivian was just about to turn in for the night when her phone buzzed insistently on the nightstand.


She glanced at the screen, lips tightening as she recognized the caller-one of the men who'd been extorting her for days now. Reluctantly, she picked up."What now?" she demanded, her voice low, barely masking her irritation. "I already paid you. Wasn't that enough?"



"Cut the act, Vivian. Don't play dumb with us." The caller sneered on the other end. "We asked for ten million, not two. You still owe us-unless you want your little secret to go public."



Vivian's tone was frosty. "You agreed to give me more time."



The group of men exchanged amused looks. One of them leaned in, a sly grin tugging at his lips. "Well,today we got some new intel. You'll bring us five million by three this afternoon."



Anger flared in Vivian's eyes as she bellowed, "I told you-l don't have that kind of money!"



"You could always hit up Brandon. Just a thought.Funny, isn't it? After today, Brandon and Millie's divorce will be official. This is your last chance.Five million, Vivian, or those files go straight to Millie and her soon-to-be ex. I'm sure you'd rather see the divorce go through quietly. If Millie finds out, she might just back out-and then you're stuck."



He finished with a self-satisfied smirk, enjoying every second.



Vivian's fist struck the table, rattling the glasses Frustration boiled over as she admitted, "I'm telling you,I just don't have the money right now."



Vivian's assets meant nothing if she couldn't turn them into cash fast enough.



"It's been ages since the fourth live stream wrapped Maybe you don't think our business is urgent?" The caller's tone dripped with impatience. "However you get the money isn't my concern. Try Brandon," he added flatly.



Then he hung up, the click ringing in her ears.



Fury blazing,Vivian hurled her phone across the couch.



She should have gotten rid of those bastards long ago.



Her caregiver hurried over, retrieved the phone, and offered it back timidly.



"Miss Simpson, what should we do now?"



Vivian snatched it away, her eyes narrowed in irritation.She brushed past the woman and slipped into a quieter room.



Certain no one could eavesdrop, she reached for a second phone and dialed a new number.




..-



Late that night, the police station had settled into its usual hush.Lynda,weary-eyed from hours at her desk,rolled her shoulders and let out a long, relieved sigh.



Her colleague caught her eye and asked if she wanted a drink as well.
"Yeah, thanks," Lynda responded, grabbing her own cup and joining him to the break room.



The fluorescent lights hummed overhead as they strolled together, conversation drifting as easily as the steam rising from their mugs.



"So, is your case almost done?" the colleague asked,tilting his head curiously



"It's getting there," Lynda replied, her voice a touch strained as she massaged her temple. "Pulling together witness statements, tracking down paperwork-it all adds up. Millie's background is...let's just say, it's not straightforward. We talked to her mom,made a trip to question her stepdad in prison,reached out to everyone tied to the Bennett family, and checked in with her friends, Alexia and Giffard. Even different Watson Group departments had to weigh in.We hauled Vivian in for questioning more than once,pored over the crime scene, canvassed the area where the suspect vanished, and picked through every scrap of surveillance footage for gaps."



The sheer weight of the workload made her temples throb. She exhaled,letting her exhaustion show.



"That's a hell of a lot to cover," the colleague remarked,shaking his head in sympathy.



Lynda took a long sip of water, letting the coolness settle her nerves. "That's just what I can recall right now. There's more, of course-mostly endless paperwork and the grunt work no one sees. The travel eats up hours, too. But we're nearly at the finish line. If things don't go sideways, we'll be able to bring Brandon in for questioning tomorrow, maybe the day after."



The colleague nodded in understanding, and together they headed back to their cluttered desks, water cups in hand.



"So, who's looking like our prime suspect these days?"he asked, trying to sound casual.



Lynda's sharp gaze snapped to his face, making him instantly rethink the question and turn his attention elsewhere.



Settling into her chair, Lynda quietly gathered her belongings



She feIt the exhaustion in her bones-a dull ache from too many late nights and not nearly enough hands on deck.








Dawn crept in, chasing the remnants of night from the city. As sunlight spilled across the skyline, the streets gradually filled with life.
Millie slipped into her morning routine, bundling Ari off to school before making her way to Evans Entertainment, her mind already fixed on the final round of the competition.



For once, she never let her phone leave her grip,glancing at the screen between every task.



If the day unfolded without trouble, she and Brandon would finally and officially end everything



So far, Brandon hadn't called or texted. The quiet brought both relief and unease.



"Let it stay peaceful. Just let midnight come and go,and this ###Chapter will finally be behind me," she whispered, clutching her phone a little tighter.



After a hectic morning, Brandon finally settled in for lunch, loosening his tie as he took a seat at the dining table.



Just as he looked down to see what he was having,the savory aroma of beef stew wafted up from a steaming bowl placed before him.



He paused, one brow arching in mild surprise, and then glanced over at Eugene.



Rubbing the back of his neck, Eugene offered an awkward smile. "Mr. Watson, you didn't seem pleased  with that beef stew from the restaurant the other night, so I brought my mom's homemade stew for you She swears it's her best dish."



Brandon merely inclined his head in acknowledgment,saying nothing more.



A soft knock broke the brief silence.



Brandon's gaze shifted toward the doorway, where Vivian lingered, her figure framed by the light spilling in fromn the hall.


She stepped inside, momentarily caught off guard when she spotted the stew gracing Brandon's table.



Eugene straightened up, curiosity flickering in his eyes."Is there something you need, Miss Simpson?"



Vivian flashed Eugene a warm smile. "I brought the same dish for Brandon. I heard he hasn't found a single restaurant in Crobert that serves decent beef stew, so I cooked this myself. Go on,Brandon, give it a try. Let me know what you think."



Eugene kept quiet, casting a sidelong glance at Brandon for any hint of reaction.



Brandon, composed as ever, accepted the container from Vivian, set it neatly on the table, and sampled the beef stew.
"Well?" Vivian leaned forward, her eyes shining with anticipation. "Do you like it?"



Brandon took his time, savoring the flavor.



The stew was perfectly fine-pleasant enough, but it still fell short of Millie's unmistakable touch.



Stil, he replied with a nod,"It's good."



Vivian's face lit up with satisfaction. She nudged the container closer and coaxed him to eat a little more.



Annoyance flickered across Brandon's face as he sent Vivian out on an errand, eager for a moment of peace.



Moments later, a knock sounded at the door-another lunch delivery, this one from Watson Mansion.



He lifted the lid to discover, unsurprisingly,a steaming beef stew and a folded note tucked neatly beside it.



Inside, his grandfather's bold script sprawled across the page. "Heard about your beef stew hunting mission. Brandon, you're missing Millie, aren't you?Bring her home. There's nothing a real conversation can't fix. We're family. That's what matters."



Reading those words, Brandon's chest tightened.



But the date loomed large in his mind-the last day before their divorce was finalized.
###Chapter 117 She Loves You To The Core
Three different servings of beef stew sat on the table before Brandon.



Hardly more than a nibble from each, Brandon set his spoon down and gave up.



Outside the window, his gaze drifted to the city,where May's early heat shimmered.



Time slipped by as he remained fixated on the view.



All around him, the silence was deep, making it seem as though someone else ought to fill the chair across from him.



Tucked in the drawer was his grandfather's note, and sorting through his own emotions felt impossible.



Finishing up with the lunch boxes, Vivian called out,"Brandon," her voice gentle as she made her way over.



With an expectant look, he turned toward her, waiting for what she might say.



Shifting awkwardly, Vivian hesitated before speaking."Um, could you... lend me some money?" she asked, clearly uneasy. "The studio's tight on funds, but I'll pay you back soon."



Brandon's reply came quickly. "How much?"



Almost whispering, Vivian kept her head low. "Five million," she said, sounding even less sure.



Pulling out his phone, Brandon didn't hesitate.



A ping from her phone signaled the transfer had gone through.



Vivian's entire face lit up. "You have no idea how much this means to me!"



No hint of emotion crossed Brandon's features. His heartbeat remained even, untouched.



Once Vivian slipped out the door, he turned to address Eugene, his ever-present assistant. "Clear everything from my schedule this afternoon and tonight."



With a simple tilt of his head, Eugene acknowledged the order.



Not long after, Brandon spoke again. "Take tomorrow off my calendar as well."



Eugene's eyes widened just slightly. The unspoken message was clear. Brandon would be closing the Chapter on his marriage first thing tomorrow.



A moment of silence passed before Eugene offered a searching look, and then answered, "Of course."



Brandon wasted no more time. Keys in one hand and jacket in the other, he stepped out into the corridor.



Eugene's voice carried down the hallway."Do you mind telling me your destination, Mr. Watson?"



A simple flick of Brandon's hand served as his only answer.



Nothing more needed to be said. Eugene knew better than to follow.



Solitude became Brandon's companion as he cruised through city streets in his Maybach, directionless.



No plan guided him. Instead, he wandered,untethered,much like a cloud searching for somewhere to settle.



At last, his drive ended. The car rolled to a stop before the gates of a mansion.



This was once the home where Millie's family built their lives.



Just down the block, Brandon's own childhood memories lingered in the walls of another house He stepped out of his car, his pace unhurried as he approached the familiar property.



Time had left its mark, and what was once grand now looked worn around the edges.



Inside, laughter filled the air. Brandon noticed the house belonged to strangers now.



Everything changed after Millie's father passed away.The property had been sold off during the settlement.



From the sidewalk, Brandon watched the new family of three, and in their joy, he caught a glimpse of summers past-Millie's family together once more in his mind.



Parents spun each other around the room,their daughter giggling at the piano keys



A red dress swirled with the music, and the little girl's joyful face seemed etched into his memory.



Someone shouted a warning, "Slow down! You might fall!"



"Ouch!" A small accident interrupted the fun. The little girl-this new family's child-had run too fast, tripped,and landed in a sulky heap, nearly in tears.



Brandon knelt beside her, producing a handkerchief to gently dry her cheeks, as though he could wipe away someone else's sorrow from long ago.


Offering comfort, he said, "You're all right," and reached out to lift her gently from the ground.



A cheerful voice called from the doorway."Thank you,Mr. Watson!" The child's mother hurried over,gratitude clear in her face.



People around here rarely forgot Brandon's name or story.



Offeing a small nod, he answered simply, "Think nothing of it."



Once more, his attention drifted down to the little girl beside him.



Tears had dried, but she now watched him with a mixture of caution and wonder.



Unexpectedly, a gentle smile broke across his face.



He rose to his feet, deciding it was time to move on.



For a split second, a wave of memory washed over him -he almost believed MAillie was standing there. Not the Millie hardened by loss, but the one before tragedy,before those cold stares.



A heavy breath left his chest as he walked back to his car.



He found himself wondering if any destination could make sense now.



With nowhere to go, Brandon pressed the accelerator,letting the city roll by



His thoughts spun for what felt like hours, until finally the skyline thinned and he realized he'd wandered into the city's forgotten edge.



Off to one side, a massive building rose against the fading light.



The bleak outline of Crobert's penitentiary stood against the sky.



A quiet certainty settled over Brandon as his car rolled to a stop. He finally understood who he needed to confront.



Once the entry process was done, he waited in the visitation room, his gaze landing on a man behind thick glass.



Recognition brought a sour grin to the inmate's face.He snatched up the phone, lips curled in disdain.



Matching the gesture, Brandon lifted the receiver and held it to his ear.
A taunt came through the line, saying, "Look who it is -Mr. Watson himself. What's so important that you'd drop by today?"


Words didn't come. Brandon answered with a steady,silent stare.



On the other side sat Hayden Grant. Once, he'd played the role of Millie's stepfather.


Suspicion edged Hayden's next question. "Millie got you running her errands now?"



Brandon's answer was simple. "I came on my own."


With eyebrows raised, Hayden seemed surprised."So it wasn't her? What could you possibly have to say?clearly remembered you said men like me wveren't even worth your breath."



No reply left Brandon's lips. He just watched Hayden,unflinching.



Time and prison had changed Hayden. His uniform sagged on a thinner frame, though nothing in his bearing suggested a truly broken man.


A shift in Brandon's demeanor unsettled Hayden. The silence pressed in, making him fidget in his seat.


Hayden broke the silence, his voice carrying a hint of challenge. "If you're not going to talk, then let me.I've been stuck here for years-tell me, how are things with you and Millie?"



No answer came from Brandon.



A sly grin crossed Hayden's face. "Seeing anyone new these days? Oh,wait-didn't you used to worship the ground she walked on, and didn't she practically live for you?" He let out a dry laugh.



Questions kept coming. "So, did the two of you ever tie the knot?"



With a slight motion, Brandon gave a nod, though he hesitated afterward.



Hayden picked up on the subtle pause, pretending to be let down. He shook his head with a sigh



"So Millie really went ahead and married into money.That's not surprising. You two always seemed close.Before Nicole and I got together, Millie already had plenty, but the Watson name carries weight. Did your family ever give her a hard time?"



Brandon shook his head, still silent.



That only seemed to draw Hayden in further."She must have a way with people, convincing everyone like that. What was her secret?"

Contact with the outside world had grown rare for Hayden,so his curiosity felt almost sincere.



Maybe Millie succeeded because she genuinely invested herself in those around her.



Everything started when Brandon's grandfather fell ill -that was the reason behind their marriage in the first place-but over time, both his grandparents grew to cherish Millie as one of their own. 1



Hayden raised his eyebrows. "Suit yourself if you don't want to talk. But what brings you here, really? You didn't drop by just for conversation, did you?" A flicker of realization crossed his face. "Wait,is Millie in some kind of mess?"



Brandon's eyes shifted downward, the weight of the question settling in.



After a pause, he answered quietly, "We're getting a divorce."



The arrangement was all for show, a plan to remarry after half a year, yet the sadness still clung to him.



Real surprise flashed across Hayden's face this time."A divorce? Your family finally turned against her?That's just her luck. She loves you to the core and will literally do anything for you, and now you're tossing her aside. I can only imagine the tears-she's probably falling apart. Honestly, that's the best news I've had all year!"



Hayden's laughter rang through the receiver, sharp and grating.



The visit drew to a close. Brandon set the phone back on the cradle and got to his feet.



A final glance at Hayden showed him still lost in cruel amusement.



Truth be told, it was never about his family rejecting Millie. The divorce was Brandon's own doing.



"Sir, it's time to go." A guard's voice broke the moment.



Turning away at last, Brandon exited the room.



As the heavy doors closed behind him, he realized the reason he'd come. The words he needed to hear were simple-"She loves you to the core."
###Chapter 118 | Won't Bother You Anymore
Hearing those words was the only thing that finally quieted the unrest inside Brandon's chest.


He stepped out of the prison and let the city swallow him,wandering aimlessly for hours.



His footsteps eventually led him to a street outside a kindergarten.



Brandon didn't leave his car-he simply sat there,watching from afar as children tumbled and laughed on the playground.


In the midst of the noise, Ari sat at a small table,head bowed as she sketched beside her friends.



Watching her, Brandon felt an unfamiliar calm unfurl quietly inside him, soothing the ache he'd been carrying.







Meanwhile, Millie was seated with a designer, her expression hidden behind a medical mask as they discussed costume details for the Heavenly Melody finals.
Her phone buzzed, slicing through the conversation.



"Sorry, I need to take this," Millie remarked, rising and slipping out into the hallway.



She glanced at the screen-Brandon's name flashed across it.



Her heart tightened instantly, every nerve on edge as she hesitated.



Millie stared at her phone in disbelief. The official decree would be finalized tomorrow-so why was Brandon calling now, of all times?



Had he... changed his mind? What would she do if he had?



Questions chased each other through her head as the phone rang on and on, refusing to let her breathe



At the last possible second, she finaly picked up and slipped quietly into the quiet far end of the hallway.



"What is it?" she demanded in a flat tone.



Brandon's voice reached her, gentle and unexpectedly intimate. "Let's have dinner tonight. Bring Ari. I've already made the reservation."



A crease appeared between Millie's brows. Her first instinct was to refuse, but she paused. With so little time left, she had no energy for another scene. So she simply asked, "Why?"



He answered softly, his words wrapped in a familiar warmth, "Millie, the decree comes through tomorrow.After that, we might not have the chance to sit down like this again for a long time."



Millie's gaze drifted up to a sleek modern painting on the wall as she struggled to steady her thoughts.


Was this dinner meant to mark the end of them?



Uncertainty twisted in her chest while she hesitated in the hush of the hallway.



Brandon lingered in silence, the weight of his words hanging between them.



At last, he murmured, "Just this once. After tonight and until we remarry-unless there's an emergency-I won't contact you or Ari again." 1


Pressing her lips into a thin line, she responded, "You'd better mean it."



She had no plans to go back to him. If he truly kept his promise, then tonight would mark a clean,final break.



"Absolutely," Brandon replied, his voice so soft it barely carried.
He sent her the restaurant details, and then ended the call.



Brandon let his phone falI to the passenger seat and gazed out the window at the kindergarten gates.



He had no idea what he was hoping for.


In a few months, Vivian would be gone. That was the plan-and after that, he and Millie would remarry.



But right now, he needed something-some reason,some grit-to pull him through the days ahead.


He looked over at Ari, still sitting on the playground,surrounded by her friends, lost in her painting. Her laughter floated across the yard, bright and unburdened.



Brandon found himself smiling, warmth blooming quietly in his chest.


Millie's brows knitted tighter as she mulled everything over, doubt gnawing at her.



After some thought, she dialed Alexia and ran through the details.



Alexia, sprawled out on her sofa with an apple slice in hand,sounded unimpressed. "Who knows what game he's playing now? As long as he actually puts his name on the divorce papers tomorrow, that's all we need."



Millie let out a faint sigh, conceding the point.



Alexia went on, her tone sharpening, "What worries me is that he invited you hoping you'll change your mind. If that's his angle, it'll just make everything messier."



Millie couldn't help but laugh dryly."Change my mind?Me? Not a chance. Vivian's still waiting for him."



Alexia shrugged,switching the fruit for the TV remote."Honestly, the chances of that are pretty slim. But if he tries to pull anything, just shut him down. Don't even give him room to maneuver. And if he refuses to sign, you've got your backup-you can drag him to court. Things will settle, one way or another."



Millie listened, her tension slowly easing as Alexia's confidence rubbed off on her.



Maybe she was overthinking it, but the persistent suspicion about Brandon's true motives lingered



"Men really do love to get self-pitied, huh? And let's be honest-he's probably just trying to keep you on a short leash, especially if he's hoping to remarry you once Vivian's gone," Alexia noted, rolling her eyes.



Millie gave a weary nod as she replied, "Yeah. That part's true."
Alexia suddenly straightened, her tone sharp with concern. "Wait-don't tell me you're actually considering getting back together with him?"



"Absolutely not!" Millie shot back, her gaze drifting to the painting on the wall. "My heart shattered in that hospital stairwell. There's no fixing that."



Alexia exhaled, regret flickering across her face."Sorry. I shouldn't have brought it up."


Millie managed a small, steady smile. "Don't worry about it. I have Ari now. That's what matters."


"Exactly. Just play along tonight. If you push back,he might make things messy tomorrow," Alexia warned,voice low and serious. "I'll have Giffard hang around nearby. If anything feels off, call him right away."



Millie agreed with a simple, "Got it."



Once the call ended, she glanced at the time-still a little while before she needed to leave. She turned her attention back to the designer, diving back into the finer points of the performance costumes.



Each piece was elaborate, demanding painstaking attention to every last detail.



"Really appreciate you pulling this off," Millie said as they wrapped up. "I'm relying on you more than ever."
The designer's grin was easy. "No worries-l've got you covered."



They'd teamed up four times now, and each project had only made their partnership stronger.



Their creative chemistry just clicked-every collaboration seemed to spark something new.



After a few more minutes of light conversation, Millie glanced at her watch, excused herself, and headed off to change clothes. Then she grabbed her keys and drove to Ari's school.



When Millie walked inside, Ari was already waiting,perched on a bench by the window.



"Millie!" Ari's eyes lit up and she hurried over for a hug.



"Come here, you." Millie crouched to her level, arms outstretched.



She squeezed Ari gently, and then leaned back to study her face. "Sweetheart, I need your opinion on something," she said, her voice low and warm."Brandon asked if we'd join him for a farewell dinner tonight. Would you like to go?"



Millie meant it-if Ari even hesitated, she'd call Brandon and decline without a second thought.

Ari tipped her head, thinking it over. "What about you?"she countered, her tone neither eager nor resistant,simply curious.


Millie met Ari's gaze, her expression softening. "You get to decide, sweetheart. If you'd rather not go,we'll skip it."



Ari's lips curled into a sly little grin. "Did he say something to you?" she teased, eyes bright with curiosity.



Millie couldn't help but laugh-she'd never seen that spark in Ari before.


"He did," she admitted, and then explained Brandon's promise: no more contact unless it was absolutely necessary.


Ari nodded as the situation clicked into place.


"Okay, let's go," she remarked with an easy smile."We'll just pretend it's dinner at the neighbor's house or something."


"You really are the best," Millie murmured, pressing a kiss to Ari's forehead.


Ari giggled and reached up, planting a playful kiss on Millie's cheek in return.
They lingered in that warm, affectionate moment-until a sudden shadow stretched across them.



Startled, they both looked up. Brandon stood there,silent, his presence dimming their smiles.



He saw the change in their faces and felt a pang of regret, but managed a gentle greeting."Hey, Ari."


Ari took a moment to think, and then greeted him with a quiet,"Hello."



Brandon gave her a subtle nod.



Straightening his posture, he turned to Millie. "Ready to go?" he inquired



Without a word, Millie squeezed Ari's hand and led her toward the parking lot.



"Why don't you both ride with me?" Brandon offered.



Millie fixed him with an icy stare.



The memory of Ari's last car ride with Brandon-how frightened she'd been when he started yelling-was still fresh in her mind.



"That's not happening," Millie declared, her voice steely. "Ari isn't gettingin your car ever again."



Brandon faltered, visibly caught off guard, but after a beat,he only nodded and kept his thoughts to himself.



They drove separately, Millie's protective grip never loosening from Ari's hand.



The sun was dipping low when they reached Crobert's renowned seaside restaurant.



As Millie and Ari stepped out of their car, Brandon joined them on the curb.



Together, the three of them walked inside, arriving just as the mellow chimes of the grand foyer clock marked five o'clock.
###Chapter 119 He Was Unhappy
The moment the trio stepped into the restaurant, a waiter greeted them with a welcoming smile.


"Mr. Watson, Mrs. Watson, and Miss..." he began,about to say "Miss Watson."


"My name is Ari Combs," Ari interjected quickly.


The waiter gave a small nod in acknowledgment.course,Miss Combs."



"Right this way, please," he said, gesturing for them to follow.



They walked past the glimmering chandeliers on the first floor and climbed the stairs to the second floor.



On the second floor, the waiter opened the door to a room and stepped aside. "This way, please."



It was the restaurant's finest private room, and had breathtaking views of the ocean.



Brandon moved ahead and pulled out chairs for Millie and Ari.
Millie didn't even spare him a glance. She quietly took off Ari's backpack and placed it aside.



"I'll take care of that," Brandon said, took the bag from Millie, and placed it on a nearby rack.



Millie pursed her lips, not uttering a word, and took a seat beside Ari.


She reached for the pitcher and poured the little girl a glass of warm water.



Brandon sat across from them, silently watching the way Millie tended to Ari with such calm attention.Something about it made his heart heavy.



The room was quiet except for the faint notes of piano music and the rhythmic sound of waves brushing the shore.



He kept his eyes on them as Millie gave Ari water and wiped her tiny hands clean. For years,he had often dreamt of this kind of scene.



Once Ari's hands were clean, he slid the menu in front of her.



"Let's see what Ari would like to eat," he said.



Millie picked up the menu and leaned toward Ari,quietly going over the choices with her. Brandon stayed quiet, his heart growing heavier.


She selected a few dishes that Ari could eat, all while barely acknowledging Brandon's presence.


Millie didn't know what he truly wanted from this dinner. All she wanted was to make it through the evening without conflict.


Soon,the food began to arrive, one dish after another.



Millie finally broke the silence after the wait staff left."What is it you want,Brandon?"


He didn't lift his eyes, just kept them fixed on the plate in front of him. "I just... I realized we've never actually shared a meal together as a family.I wanted that at least once."



Millie's expression soured. A part of her wanted to say they weren't really a family, but she bit her tongue There were only a few more hours left to get through.



"I know you're still angry with me," Brandon said,his eyes turning to the waves outside. "A lot has happened this year. I never intended for some of those things to happen... but they happened regardless. I could do nothing to stop them."


Though his voice stayed calm, the way he dropped his gaze hinted at emotions he didn't put into words.
Millie gazed at his profile. It was the first time in days that she had really allowed herself to look at him.



His features were striking. He had well-defined brows,sharp eyes, a tall nose, and lips that always seemed unreadable.



He looked just as he always had, and yet... something about him felt different.



"Are you talking about Vivian?" Millie asked plainly



Brandon turned his head to meet her gaze.



Millie's face looked calm, with no trace of anger.



Her voice carried no emotion. It felt as though she were speaking about someone else's story entirely.



"I've been thinking about everything these past few days," she said slowly, choosing her words with care.



The only reason she had agreed to this dinner was to make sure Brandon would sign the divorce papers the next day. That was all that mattered to her now.


"You're right. Vivian doesn't have much time left. It's good that you're by her side," Millie said as she turned her attention to Ari, gently helping her with the food.



She made sure Ari had enough on her plate and was eating well.
Millie had already made her decision. Once the divorce was finalized the following day, she would finally be free.Whatever Brandon did after that, with Vivian or anyone else, would no longer be her business.



Her only focus would be reclaiming the Bennett family's legacy, uncovering the truth about her father's death, and building a peaceful life with Ari.



The room settled into silence again. The soft clinking of cutlery as Millie fed Ari echoed in the air.



Brandon's eyes lingered on her calm, steady movements. He tried to read between the lines of her tone.



Was she just mocking him, or was she really going along with everything?



But she didn't sound sarcastic.



If she truly meant what she said, it should have comforted him. Yet somehow, it didn't. And he couldn't understand why.


A few more dishes were brought in. Ari gave her belly a soft pat. "I'm full."



"There's a TV over there. Want me to turn it on for you?" Millie asked.
She picked Ari up from her chair and walked her to the restroom first.



The spacious room had a dining space and a few recreational spaces.



Millie switched on the TV and set it to Tom and Jerry before leaving Ari to watch.



She then returned to her seat and began to eat quietly.



The sky was growing darker. Brandon sighed and finally said, "Lately, I've been thinking about the past."



Millie dropped her eyes to her plate, saying nothing



"| remember the countries we traveled to, how we chased our dreams together," he added.



He reached for the wine bottle and poured her a glass.



"I'll be driving Ari home later," Millie turned the wine down,her tone clear and unwavering.



"I'll call Eugene later, and we'll find someone to drive you both home," Brandon replied as he filled his own glass. "It's just a mild wine. I know you haven't been fine since your last injury."



Millie glanced at the drink. The color was light, and the scent was faint. It really did seem closer to fruit juice than alcohol.
She collected the glass, took a small sip, and then placed it back on the table.



Brandon held his own glass loosely, staring out at the calm sea. "I remember our wedding... the meals you used to cook... our house. You always stood by me.And..."



"I don't want to talk about the past," Millie said,cutting him off.



Not all memories were worth holding on to.



For her, everything had started to decay the moment he chose Vivian.



She looked down at the table cloth's patterns. "I don't even understand what you're trying to say."



Brandon looked down at her.



He had wanted to tell her that he was about to face something big, something he had chosen to take on alone without her. But the words didn't come.



She was still angry, distant, and unwilling to loosen up.



So he swallowed the rest of his words and changed the subject. "I visited Hayden today."


Millie's hand froze in place. She lifted her eyes to meet his.
"He's been in there for five years now. He seems alright." Brandon added, "He asked about you actually."



"And what did you tell him?" Millie asked tensely.



"I told him you were doing fine. And that we're about to divorce," Brandon answered.



"And how did he react to that?" Millie pressed.



"He just laughed," Brandon replied.


Millie gave a cold chuckle, set down her fork, and picked up her glass of wine. She stared out at the sea for a moment before taking a sip.



"So,why did you go visit him?" she asked.



Brandon didn't respond right away. Instead, his eyes drifted around the room.



"Do you remember? Five years ago, right after his sentencing...we came here."


Outside, the wind skimmed over the water,leaving tiny ripples. Millie watched them in silence.



Of course she remnembered.



Although it had been five years, she never truly forget.


That was the day she finally broke free from the
###Chapter 120 I'll See You At The Courthouse
Seven years back,after Brandon first pulled Millie out from under Hayden's thumb, Hayden had played it safe for a while, intimidated by Brandon's real identity.But as the memory faded, his old arrogance crept back in, bolder with every passing month.



"You honestly think I'm clueless, Millie? Brandon never cared about you-he just wanted a little fun.Look at the Watson family. Look at yourself. Still pretending you're the Bennett family's princess?"Hayden sneered, his words dripping with contempt "Your family's gone. If I hadn't taken you and your mother in, you'd both be out begging in the rain.Don't ever forget that. From now on, you'll start handing over money to me-every singe month. Got it?"



Insult after insult, demand after demand-each one nastier than the last-had piled up, grinding her down.



Then came that storm-soaked afternoon, five years ago. She'd returned home to check on her mother,slipping inside only after confirming Hayden wasn't around. But the apartment was eerily empty. Her mother was gone.
That was when Hayden staggered through the doorway, breath heavy with alcohol, his voice slurred.



Millie sensed danger and instinctively tried to back away,but Hayden blocked her path and seized her arm in a bruising grip.



He started barking for cash, his voice sharp with impatience, but her royalties from the last single hadn't cleared yet.



"Hey, aren't you Brandon's girl now? Didn't you say he's head over heels for you? Make him give me the money then. Right now!"



"I told you already-I'm not going to beg him for your sake. I'll earn it myself, just give me-ah!"



She didn't get the chance to finish. Hayden's fist tangled in her hair, and he slammed her head into the door with brutal force.



A sudden rush of blood streamed down her forehead.



"Who do you think you're fooling?" he huffed derisively. "No money from Brandon? What are you doing then, selling yourself on the side?"



"I'm not!" Millie cried, fighting to break free.


Hayden forced her head down and spat in her face,his breath reeking of alcohol. "Still playing innocent for Brandon's sake? That's rich. It's been two years already-what, you're just his little simp?”



Millie thrashed wildly, gasping, "Let go of me!"



Hayden's hands clamped down harder.He slammed her head against the door, and then the floor-again and again, a dizzying rain of blows.



Summoning every ounce of strength, she twisted around and sank her teeth deep into his flesh. Hayden howled,jerking his hand away at last.



She broke free, scrambling across the floor on her elbows and knees, her vision swimming with blood.Everything blurred red. Blindly, she reached for her phone, fumbling for the emergency call-anything,anyone.



Hayden's fist shnot out, knocking the phone from her grip. "You fucking bitch! You dare bite me?" he spat face twisted with rage. "See if I don't beat you to death!"



He hurled a string of curses at her, voice echoing off the walls. "Last time, he swooped in and saved you.Where is he now, huh? Go on,call for Brandon-let's see if he comes running this time! Why are you crying now? Realized nobody's coming for you, haven't you?"



He crouched over her, breath hot and sour against her "The day your mother married me,you stopped being a Bennett. You're a Grant now. Don't even dream of getting away, Millie. Not in this lifetime."



The rain battered the windows, its roar swallowing her sobs as blood and tears streaked down her face.



Agony radiated through every inch of her body, so sharp and relentless she could hardly draw a breath.



Helplessness burned inside her, a poisonous self-loathing for her own weakness-she despised how powerless she was to fight back


Hayden,eyes blazing and reeking of alcohol, slammed her with a force that made her bones tremble.



For one terrifying moment, she truly believed she wouldn't survive.



Just before her vision faded to black, a shadow crashed through the door-someone familiar, voice thunderous with rage. "Hayden, I've warned you!"



Brandon's silhouette filled her blurry gaze-he'd come for her again.



Somehow, the desperate number she'd dialed had connected her to him. He'd stormed in, ripped Hayden away, and swept her into his arms.


Five years ago, that raining day, he had murmured into her ear, "Don't be afraid. I'm here."



Now, in the gentle hush of the seaside restaurant,Millie tried to steady herself with another sip of wine,the rim trembling faintly against her lip.



"He has every reason to laugh at my misery," she remarked quietly, setting her glass aside with a shaky breath. "He hates me that much."



A decade locked away.


It wasn't just the beating-five years back, Brandon had pieced together every crime Hayden ever committed and handed it all to the police. He made sure Hayden paid for everything, right down to orchestrating Hayden's divorce from Nicole.



Only after that had Millie finally clawed her way out of hell.



"So, what is this?" she asked, searching Brandon's face across the candlelit table. "Did you bring me here just to walk down memory lane?"



He met her gaze, eyes lingering on the faint redness along her lashes.



Brandon shook his head slowly.



"I just picked this place at random," he answered, his voice low.
Millie gave a small nod, swallowing down the ache in her chest.



"If we're done here, maybe we should just call it a night," she said, her voice steady but quiet. "You wanted dinner-we had dinner. You wanted Ari here -she's here. What else could you possibly want from me now?"



Outside, the sky had deepened to a deep sapphire blue, the darkness pressing against the restaurant's windows.



Brandon hesitated, and then looked right at her."Would you dance with me?" he asked softly, his gaze gentle and oddly vulnerable.



Millie looked enchanting in the dim light, her eyes still rimmed red, hair drawn back in a loose bun that made her seem even more delicate.



But to Brandon, none of that mattered-what he saw was the girl she'd once been, barefoot in the yard,laughing without fear.


That long-ago summer still haunted him. He'd been the outsider, lurking on the fringes, watching the Bennetts through windows and half-open doors,hungry for even a scrap of the happiness they shared.



All these years later, he wanted just one more memory with her.


"Just like when you were little," Brandon murmured.



He switched on the music-something slow and sweet -and stepped closer,holding out his hand.



Millie hesitated, her gaze falling to his outstretched hand as a quiet ache filled her chest.


Memories of her parents flooded back-her father's gentle laugh, her mother's warm embrace.



In those days, the Bennett family stood at the very top of Crobert's social pyramid. James Bennett had been the favorite to claim the city's elusive fourth seat of power, their family's future bright and boundless.



Back then, the world seemed to revolve around the three of them, cocooned in happiness that felt unbreakable.



She used to believe their little family would always stay untouched.



Her parents' love had been the envy of all Crobert.But fate tore them apart-her father lost far too soon,and her mother left to weather hardship alone.



She still remembered the day she went to Nicole,desperately hoping for her help to adopt Ari. Millie had tried calling Nicole "Mom," reaching for a connection that simply wasn't there. Nicole refused, holding herself at arm's length.



Year after year, Nicole seemed to slip further away,her warmth replaced by a polite chill.



Maybe, for Nicole, there was a different story-a truth Millie had never been meant to know.



"Millie?" Brandon's voice drifted to her, low and hesitant.



Millie blinked, pushing aside her memories, and let her fingers slip into his outstretched hand. He steadied her as she rose to her feet.



He drew her close, guiding her into the soft,measured rhythm of a waltz.



The music wrapped around them, its gentle current blurring the world beyond the circle of his arms.



His hand pressed lightly at her waist, steering her with practiced ease, each movement threaded with subtle grace.



Leaning down, Brandon murmured close to her ear,"There's so much I never got to choose. But all those choices-right or wrong-somehow brought us here."


She tilted her chin, meeting his gaze, finding a vulnerability there that unsettled her.
"I know you're angry," he went on, his words almost a sigh. "Angry at the way I wrecked our marriage.Angry that I wouldn't leave Vivian's side. Angry that Babette took aim at the people your family once trusted."



He paused, his breath brushing against her cheek ashe pressed on. "Millie, in five months, everything will be the same as it always was. We'll go right back-like none of this ever happened. Just like before."



The final notes of the waltz faded, leaving them suspended in silence.



Millie slipped her hands from his and retreated a step,deliberately placing distance between their bodies.



He hesitated, clearly wanting to say more, but she turned away, refusing to look back at him.



Just like before? There was no going back-not after everything.



Some wounds never healed. Some hearts, once shattered, stayed that way forever.



Taking a controlled breath, she declared, her voice sharp and unwavering, "Tomorrow morning, nine o'clock. Bring the receipt and every document we'll need. I'll see you at the courthouse."
###Chapter 121 A Photo





When her words faded, Millie turned to scoop Ari into her arms.



A glance at his watch reminded Brandon that Eugene and the rest of their group hadn't arrived yet."Eugene is on his way. Let's not risk driving after a few drinks. How about we mark the night with a picture while we wait? It'll be a nice memory," he suggested.


Before their separation became official, Brandon yearned for one last photo of them together-a keepsake to bridge the months apart if they ever decided to reunite.



A family portrait would be something to hold onto when all else felt uncertain.


Still, he chose not to share this longing with anyone.


A moment of hesitation flickered in Millie's eyes, but Ari's small hand wrapped around hers, silently urging her not to say no.


In a barely-there voice, Ari whispered, "Dinner at the neighbor's house, remember?"


The gentle comment served as a nudge-they went so far, and it simply wasn't worth it to refuse Brandon now. What if he got mad and changed his mind about the divorce?


Millie took a deep breath and agreed with a small nod.


Waving a staff member over, Brandon handed off the camera he'd brought just for this moment.


Together, they made sure the angle was right, the backdrop framing them perfectly against the sea's vast expanse.


Few places in the city could rival the beauty of this seaside restaurant, especially with the windows framing the endless water.


Even with night blanketing the sky, the shoreline sparkled, bathing the ocean in a breathtaking glow.


Brandon extended his arms, his voice gentle. "Let me take Ari," he said, hoping to help.


Instead of accepting, Millie shifted to one side.


Without raising her gaze, she replied quietly, "I'll manage on my own." Any contact between Brandon and her daughter was something she wanted to avoid.


Ari wrapped her arms tightly around Millie's neck, her words a soft plea. "Millie, I want you to hold me."


Left with nothing to say, Brandon conceded, his disappointment masked behind a polite nod.


That was how their family portrait came to be-posed, stiff, and with a tension that clung to the edges of the frame.


The staff member returned with the camera, offering it back with a smile. "Here you go, Mr. Watson.How did it turn out? If you're not happy, we can always try again."
Millie didn't wait for a reply. "It's good enough," she said,voice firm.
With a sleepy sigh, Ari nestled closer to Millie. "Millie,I'm tired. I want to go home and sleep," she murmured, her yawn stretching across the quiet room.
Glancing only briefly at the snapshot, Brandon tucked the camera away.
A simple gesture dismissed the server, and quiet settled over the three of them, thick as the night outside.
Rocking Ari gently in her arms, Millie turned with a question.ny idea when Eugene and the others will show up? If they're running late, I'll just find a taxi."
Brandon gave a reassuring answer. "They're probably close." In truth, he hoped the wait might stretch a little longer.

A little more time might allow for the honest conversation he'd been wanting.
However, his optimism faded as Millie focused solely on Ari, her soothing touch making it clear she had no interest in chatting.
Annoyance flickered across Millie's face as she remembered Alexia's warning from earlier. Alexia had even set things up so Giffard was standing by.
Determined to take control, Millie poulled out her phone and searched for Giffard's number.
Brandon caught sight of the name on her screen, and his expression darkened with suspicion.
A question slipped out. "Why are you calling him?"
After all, Brandon was right there, and his people were almost at the door. Why reach for Giffard?
Millie pressed the call button anyway. "He's picking Ari and me up," she answered simply.
That answer didn't sit well with Brandon. His frown deepened as he reached over to end the call.
"What do you think you're doing?" Millie shot him a fierce glare.
Brandon spoke up, his tone firm. "Eugene is nearly here. There's really no reason to involve anyone else."

Once Ari was safely dropped off, Giffard would still have the task of getting Millie back to her place safely.
With the end of their marriage drawing near, Brandon found himself resisting the thought of Giffard giving her a ride home.
He pressed the point again. "Let my team handle your ride."
A wave of frustration swept over Millie.
Her patience had already worn thin-she hadn't even wanted to pose for the picture earlier, and now she felt cornered again.
A sharp reply left her lips. "Giffard's character is above reproach. He's not the type you're implying he is." Despite her words, Brandon refused to give in.
Before anyone could say more, her phone began to buzz, Giffard's name bright on the screen.
Without hesitating, Millie accepted the call. "It's me,yes. We're on the second floor. Can you come get us? Thank you."
The conversation ended, leaving her to wait beside Ari in silence.

A storm of frustration brewed inside Brandon, though there was nothing he could do.
Every effort he'd made to smooth things over-choosing this place, trying to show patience-had been meant to bring her some comfort.①
Moments earlier, he thought he'd glimpsed a shift in her mood, some softening. So why did she reach for Giffard now?

Years spent believing he understood her had done little to help in recent weeks. Each day made her more of a mystery.

When had Millie turned so unyielding?
Even after he explained Vivian's illness, insisting she didn't have long, Millie's anger refused to fade.
He called her name, "Millie," hoping to bridge the distance, but she said nothing, cradling Ari close.
Before Brandon could find the right words, a sharp knock sounded at the door.
Millie responded instantly, crossing the room with Ari still clinging to her.
A twist of the handle revealed three faces-Giffard,Eugene, and the woman she didn't recognize.
Without delay, Giffard crossed the threshold,taking his place beside Millie and Ari.
Eugene's eyes flicked around the room, confusion clouding his expression.
He distinctly remembered Brandon asking for a female driver to assist with transportation. Yet, for some reason, Giffard had shown up instead.
Tension hummed in the air, made sharper by the way
Brandon regarded Giffard-every glance tight and guarded.
For a moment, Eugene seemed uncertain, his voice faltering before he finally spoke. "Mr. Watson, we-"
Interrupting swiftly, Millie cut in, "Don't worry about it,Eugene. Giffard was already here. He'll be driving me, so there's no need for the driver you brought."
Having worked alongside Eugene before, she preferred not to create any extra difficulty, especially when she knew Brandon was the reason he'd come.
Without sparing Brandon a glance, Millie turned to Giffard. "Would you mind fetching my bag and Ari's backpack from the rack?"

In response, Giffard gave a quiet nod, cast a quick look in Brandon's direction, and walked off to collect their things.

Brandon stood by, silently observing Giffard as he tucked Ari's backpack away and handed Millie her bag.
Preparations complete,Millie and Giffard made ready to depart.
Her name left Brandon's lips in a quiet plea.-"Millie."
No response came from her; instead, she fell into step behind Giffard, making her way downstairs.
Their history together ran deep. In their youth, he had rescued her more than once, but her own sacrifices-seven long years of her life and the pain of losing two children-had been just as real.
Such was the nature of love and loss, forever tangled.

Once upon a time, their passion burned so brightly that parting felt impossible, and they would have risked it all for each other.
Yet, moving on sometimes came as suddenly as a storm breaking.
When she resolved to sever ties, nothing could stop her.
Holding Ari close, Millie walked steadily toward her car.
Uncertainty flickered between Eugene and the female driver as they glanced Brandon's way."What now,Mr.Watson?"
A chill crept into Brandon's tone. "Get in the car," he said, already heading for the stairs.
Millie's car pulled away while Brandon slipped into the back seat of his Maybach.
In silence, the driver took the wheel and Eugene claimed the front seat, his eyes darting nervously to the mirror.
"Follow them." A curt command broke the hush.
Brandon intended to keep watch, trailing close behind until Giffard and Millie went their separate ways.
###Chapter 122 Genuine Affection Just For Her

Millie leaned over and gently smoothed the collar of Ari's jacket, her fingertips lingering to straighten a stray thread.
Giffard spoke up, his voice cutting through the silence. "He's on our tail. Want me to shake him off?"
Millie flicked her gaze up to the rearview mirror,her eyes briefly meeting Brandon's headlights. She gave a calm shake of her head. "Let him follow."
They had nothing to hide, and Ari wouldn't likely handle a fierce car race.
She pressed her palm reassuringly to Ari's knee,drawing a soft breath as she remembered the adoption procedures that were on the way and the papers she signed with the children's home-the ones that gave her the right to boring Ari out.
Brandon could only request visits, and Ari had the freedom to turn him away.
The city rolled past as they made their way to the children's home.

Once there, Millie gently guided Ari back inside, her hand resting protectively on the little girl's shoulder.Outside, Giffard lingered near the car, jaw set,waiting for the inevitable confrontation.

Brandon's car screeched to a halt. Without hesitation, he climbed out and stalked straight toward Giffard.

Giffard folded his arms and regarded Brandon coolly,not budging an inch. "What's this? You looking for a fight?"

Brandon stood stone-still, his glare sharp enough to cut through steel as he locked eyes with Giffard.

The air between them felt charged, every breath drawn taut with silent hostility, as though the slightest spark might ignite a fight right there.
Just then, Millie stepped out, her heels clicking on the pavement. She shot the men a look, exasperated and tired. "Giffard, let's go," she said, her voice steady but low.
As she reached for the car door, Brandon's hand shot out, fingers closing around her wrist.
In an instant, Giffard moved in, catching her other arm with a grip just as firm.
Millie's brow furrowed, a trace of impatience flashing across her face. "What are you two doing?"
Neither man replied. They only stared at her, silent and stubborn, as if daring her to pick a side.
She shook off Brandon's hold first, and then turned to face Giffard."Giffard," she called out.
For a split second, something flickered in Giffard's eyes-a flash of disappointment, quickly hidden. He released her wrist and stepped back, jaw tight,refusing to let his emotions show.
"Let's get going," Millie murmured, her tone steady.
"It's late."



Without another glance at Brandon, she slid back into the car.


Giffard slipped behind the wheel, his movements quiet and deliberate, while Brandon stood alone beneath the dim streetlight, eyes icy and unyielding as he watched her leave.



Millie pressed the window switch, shutting out his penetrating stare.


The ride home unfolded in heavy silence, the shadow of Brandon's car trailing them in the rearview like a warning that refused to fade.


Outside, the streetlights cast jittery halos across the windshield, their stark glow making the night feel claustrophobic and tense. Restlessness gnawed at Millie as she stared at the passing blur of lights.


When they finally arrived at her apartment building,Giffard put the car in park and stepped out to escort her inside.
At the elevator, Millie paused, turning to meet his patient gaze.

"Giffard, I mean it-thanks for everything today," she noted, her lips curving in a tired but genuine smile."Let me buy you dinner next time."
Giffard lowered his gaze, voice steady but distant.
"I'll walk you up, that's all. Just wanna make sure you're safe," he responded calmly.
Millie nodded. If she invited him inside and even allowed him to linger, Brandon would almost certainly react-but she wasn't interested in more conflict.
Their divorce decree would be finalized tomorrow;the last thing she needed now was to add fuel to the gossip mill.
She felt nothing romantic for Giffard, and didn't want their friendship misread.

Just then, the low growl of a Maybach engine echoed nearby. Millie shook her head, refusing Giffard's offer.
As Brandon's car rolled to a stop, he burst out, only to see Giffard lightly patting Millie's shoulder while she stepped into the elevator.
The doors began to slide shut just as Brandon approached, catching a brief glimpse of Millie's composed profile before she disappeared from view.
Brandon lunged forward, hand reaching for the call button, but Giffard's grip on his wrist stopped him cold.

For a moment, their eyes locked-a silent clash sparking between them-while the red numbers on the elevator panel ticked steadily up to the eleventh floor.At last, Giffard let go, allowing Brandon's arm to fall back to his side.
Giffard offered a casual grin. "Let's go together. Mind giving me a ride?"
His words made it clear he had no intention of heading upstairs after Brandon left-and that he expected Brandon to do the same and leave Millie alone.
Brandon studied Giffard, his gaze icy, before glancing at the waiting elevator. With a quiet nod, he agreed.
Taking Giffard along would keep things in his control.They made their way back to the Maybach.
As the doors closed behind them, Eugene and the driver at the wheel exchanged a quick, bewildered glance, both silently wondering what drama they'd just witnessed.
Brandon turned to Giffard and asked, "Where to?"
Giffard flashed an easy smile at the driver. "Crobert Hospital,please."
He then turned to Eugene and Brandon, his tone light."Appreciate it."
He spoke as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

Brandon shut his eyes, refusing to engage further,pretending to nap as the car pulled away and headed for the hospital.
Giffard studied Brandon, hesitating before breaking the uneasy silence. "There's nothing going on between me and Millie," he finally said.
Brandon cracked an eye open, giving Giffard a sidelong look.
"I did it on purpose," Giffard admitted, a faint, almost taunting smile tugging at his lips. "Watching you treat her that way pissed me off, so I pushed your buttons."

A muscle in Brandon's jaw tightened.
"What you saw at the hospital-she was hurt, and I was just helping her out," Giffard explained, his voice steady but firm.
Brandon didn't buy it for a second. He could read men far too well.

Giffard only shrugged, meeting Brandon's skepticism head-on, "It's the truth. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother explaining."
His expression tightened, voice low and sincere."Tomorrow, after you get that divorce decree, do me one favor: remember all the good she's done for you.Don't let Vivian make her life hell."
Brandon's expression flickered, uncertainty passing across his face before he looked away.
"I'm not that cruel," Brandon replied in an even tone."Vivian isn't, either."
As long as Millie kept herself in line, no one was going to hurt her.
Giffard parted his lips as if to speak, but thought better of it and fell silent, his eyes drifting to the world beyond the window.
Without warning, a thunderous bloom of fireworks erupted across the night sky.
The city's attention snapped upward, faces illuminated by the brilliant, shimmering display.

Brandon watched the bursts of color in silence, a pang of regret twisting inside him. Those fireworks had been his surprise for Millie-a plan for a gentle goodbye beneath a sky set alight.
Now, the gesture felt hollow.


···
Meanwhile, Millie emerged from the bathroom, the distant explosions echoing through her apartment.
Drawn to the commotion, she slipped onto the balcony in her pajamas. Overhead, the night unfurled in showers of light-bursts of color exploding across the city skyline, spinning and shimmering in every imaginable shape.
A warm breeze swept past as she curled up in the lounge chair,gaze lifted.
The fireworks painted her face in fleeting, shifting hues.
Lost in the spectacle, Millie found herself drifting back to a memory-a year ago, on the night of their hasty wedding. He'd brought her outside, beneath a velvet sky, to the lawn of their new home. With a spark in his eyes, he pressed a fuse into her hand, a quiet smile lingering on his lips.
"Go ahead. Light it," he murmured, his voice soft with mischief.
Her curiosity flared. Millie bent to ignite the fuse, and he gently drew her back, arms circling her waist as they watched together.
The firework shot up with a piercing whistle, and she gasped, laughter bubbling out as it burst in a brilliant spray overhead.
But before her laughter had faded, a chain of fireworks suddenly erupted across the city skyline,their dazzling blooms multiplying in every direction.
The city below was ablaze with color, all set off by her single spark.
"I snuck this into the wedding plans," he'd whispered against her ear, his breath sending a pleasant shiver down her spine. "Do you like it?"

She'd turned, eyes shining, and nodded hard. "It's YouCam Makeup perfect.I love it."
She could still see the tender curve of his smile, the
way his eyes softened with genuine affection just for
her.
But now,all of that warmth-and the heart behind it-
belonged to someone else entirely
###Chapter 123 She Really Had A Car Accident That Night
AIl across Crobert, brilliant fireworks painted the sky for what seemed like forever, drawing crowds out of every neighborhood to marvel at the spectacle.
Curiosity bubbled up in the crowd. "There haven't been any official announcements about fireworks lately.Is there some special reason tonight?"
Another chimed in, "I tried checking, too. The last festival wrapped up weeks ago, and the local schedule shows nothing planned for today."
Puzzlement spread among them. "So what's the story,then?"
Someone guessed. "Maybe some wealthy guy is trying to win over his girlfriend. Remember when Brandon and Millie tied the knot last year? The city was alight with fireworks all night long."
<###Chapter 123 She Really Had A Car Accident Th..  +120 Points at most Another voice softened with nostalgia. "That's right.I'll never forget it. The whole place glittered for hours. No one but Brandon could pull off something that extravagant."
A note of disappointment crept in. "Such a shame,really. They didn't even make it past a year, and now everyone says Brandon's with Vivian."
Sympathy surfaced. "Careful what you say. Vivian's gone through enough as it is."

...
Far from the chatter, Vivian stood at her window,eyes drawn to the fireworks blazing above Crobert.
A memory surfaced-Brandon had handed her the divorce filing receipt the very day he and Millie had made things official. She knew exactly when it happened.
For weeks, she kept to herself, quietly steering clear of anything that might upset Millie.
Avoiding trouble became her only goal; the last thing she wanted was for Millie to drag her feet and hold up the divorce.
Still...
Restlessness took hold of Vivian as she wandered through her home, clutching her phone tightly.
Why hadn't any updates come through yet?
Arrangements for collecting the five million had already been made, but the rest of the plan remained uncertain.
Every step needed to be flawless. If Millie uncovered any of this and spoke with Brandon, the divorce might unravel completely.
Even after the required 30-day waiting period, both parties would have to collect the divorce certificate within the following month.
With these worries swirling, Vivian couldn't resist dialing the contact again.
A few rings later, the call finally connected.
Her voice dropped to a whisper. "Is everything moving along?"


A low male voice responded, "We're on it."


Vivian pressed further, her tone barely audible. "Be sure to comb through all their online records. If there's any kind of automatic release set up, it could ruin everything."


"Got it," came the calm reply.


Not wanting any slip-ups, Vivian asked, "Where exactly are you? Don't come back until you know for.sure."


"Outside the city," the voice replied. Just then, a loud crash echoed through the call, something heavy clearly hitting the ground.


A harsh curse burst from the deep voice. "Damn it!"And then, the line went dead.



...


Out on the city's edge, Alexia made her way toward the Hussain estate, a cheerful tune spilling from her lips.
Hidden away in the depths of the family mansion's cellar, a prized bottle of wine waited for her.
Plans had already begun forming in her mind-a proper celebration for Millie's divorce decree, which would be official by tomorrow.

Her song carried her down a narrow track, but her steps faltered when a sudden, jarring crash split the quiet air ahead.

Startled, she froze. What on earth was that sound?
A sharp curve revealed the scene-a black car idling not far down the road.
The vehicle shot ahead, as if desperate to leave something-or someone-behind.
Alexia's eyes tracked a shape tumbling violently across the gravel. For one horrified moment, she realized it looked unmistakably human.
To her shock, the car's tires rolled over the sprawled figure again, not even hesitating.

No accident,this-whoever sat behind the wheel had done it on purpose.
"Ah!" A piercing scream tore from Alexia's throat.
Her mind refused to process what she had just seen.
With trembling hands, she guided her car to the shoulder, hazard lights flickering like frantic fireflies.
As the black vehicle vanished down the road, Alexia wasted no time dialing 911.


...
Giffard and Brandon arrived together at the local police station.
Brandon was giving Giffard a ride to the Crobert Hospital, but everything changed when Giffard's phone started ringing.
Alexia's tearful voice spilled through the line,describing how she'd seen a car deliberately mow someone down and speed away. She kept crying and begged him in a trembling voice to come pick her up at the suburban station.

Brandon,seated within earshot, caught every word.
He offered Giffard a solution. "Take my car. Just drop me off on the way."
After a moment's thought, Brandon realized that would take a detour and decided to tag along anyway, just in case there was any way he could help.
On the drive over, they let the driver out halfway since her job was originally to drive Millie home, and then continued to the outskirts with Eugene.
At the station, Alexia was still seated with an officer,recounting her story.
Despite years as a doctor and countless emergencies, she had never before witnessed a scene quite so brutal.

She still didn't know if the victim had survived after the merciless hit-and-run.
After rendering first aid at the scene, Alexia watched as paramedics whisked the injured person away in an ambulance, leaving the outcome uncertain.
By now, she had regained much of her composure compared to her earlier frantic call to Giffard.
Meanwhile, Lynda caught sight of Brandon in the bustling station.
Earlier in the day, she had been busy sorting records at another precinct, preparing to summon Brandon for questioning the following morning. News of an incident on the outskirts had interrupted her plans.Surveillance footage from the area quickly surfaced,capturing a glimpse of the driver.
Disguise or not, the suspect's build reminded her of someone involved in Millie's case.
With doubts swirling, her colleagues forwarded the footage and requested that she come by to take a look herself.

After reviewing the video, she couldn't be certain, but there was indeed a striking resemblance.
Stepping outside, her eyes landed on Brandon,sparking immediate curiosity.
What was he doing here at this hour?
Without hesitation, she called out to him.
"Mr. Watson!" Lynda called, her stride brisk as she closed the distance.
Brandon's brow furrowed, confusion clear on his face; he didn't recall ever meeting this officer.
He replied with a polite formality though, "Is there something you need, Officer?"
The commotion drew Giffard's attention as well,leaving him equally uncertain.
Lynda showed her badge. "You're Millie Bennett's husband, correct?" she asked, fixing Brandon with a steady look.
A silent nod from Brandon confirmed his identity.
Lynda continued, "This concerns the car accident involving your wife..."
Paperwork handled, she guided Brandon to an empty room, and at last the situation started to come into focus for him.
Trailing behind, Eugene kept talking-mentioning lawyers and legal steps that might be needed. But the instant Brandon heard the words "Millie" and accident", he followed Lynda directly into the room.
Her words echoed in his mind. An uneasy sense of foreboding crept over Brandon. Answers-perhaps long-hidden-felt suddenly within reach.
A barrage of questions came from the police.
They wanted to know his whereabouts on the night in question.
He replied that he had spent the evening at the Watson Group offices.
They pressed further, asking who was with him.
He answered, "Vivian."
Precise times, specific locations, and a host of other details filled the officers' notepads.
Every question put to him received a direct response.Yet, beneath the surface, Brandon's thoughts spun around one thing-Millie really had been in an accident that night.

A police officer broke the silence. "We're aware that you and your wife have recently filed for divorce..."
Such circumstances provided a potential motive for arranging harm.
"We plan to pick up the divorce decree tomorrow,"Brandon said.
A silent understanding passed between the officers;they nodded after a quick exchange of glances.
In truth, weeks of investigation had lessened their suspicions of Brandon considerably.
Their attention now shifted in a different direction.
Still, Lynda asked further, "Why didn't you respond when your wife called repeatedly that day?"
Words failed him. "I..." Brandon stammered, unable to explain.

Back then, he'd seen Millie's name flash on his screen and, expecting another argument, ended the call.

Her persistence brought a second ring, which he muted, choosing to ignore.
The officers looked at each other once more, clearly urging Brandon to explain himself.
Endless questions came his way, each one more pointed than the last, covering every possible detail.
Meanwhile, confusion and regret tangled in Brandon's mind.
###Chapter 124 He Couldn't Breathe
"We noticed someone named Macauley Valdez was once employed at your company. He was dismissed recently. Could you tell us why?" the officer asked.

"Does this relate to the case?" Brandon asked in return.


"We're required to question anyone who might be connected."

Brandon's gaze was distant, his mind spinning. abused his power and embezzled company funds,"he said flatly.

...

Even after leaving the interrogation room, Brandon still felt like he was trapped in a dream.

He leaned against the hallway wall, surrounded by the low murmur of the police station at night, but the only thing echoing in his mind was the officer's question-"Why didn't you respond when your wife called repeatedly that day?"
He looked up at the white ceiling, his chest tightening with pain that felt almost physical.
"Mr. Watson, are you alright?" Eugene rushed over, a lawyer trailing behind him.
The lawyer immediately went to speak with the officers.

Brandon just shook his head in silence.
Nearby, Alexia and Giffard sat together, quietly talking.

"I was really scared," Alexia said in a soft voice. "I've dealt with hopeless moments at work..but this was different. I've never witnessed someone getting murdered right in front of me."
"You handled it well," Giffard reassured his sister gently. "You called 911 right away. You even started emergency care when it was needed. I spoke with the hospital; they're still trying to resuscitate the victim."



"Do they have a chance?" she asked quickly.


"It doesn't look good," he replied, his tone heavy.


"I heard they've cordoned off the area to search. But the place where the car was abandoned is surrounded by steep mountains. If someone's hiding there..." Alexia began, but stopped when a shadow fell over her.


She looked up to see Brandon.


Annoyed, she stood and turned to leave.


"Alexia," Brandon called after her.


She kept walking.


"I know now," Brandon said, fists clenched.


She stopped and slowly turned back, confused.


Giffard, still seated,frowned."Know what?"


He had felt uneasy ever since Brandon was taken in.
Both he and Alexia had already cooperated with the investigation.


"I know the car accident really happened," Brandon said, eyes slightly red, voice low. He looked only at Alexia.



Alexia rolled her eyes, frustration flaring.


Pointing at him, she snapped, "I told you Millie had been in an accident and she needed you. I begged you to come to the hospital. You came but you brought Vivian with you! Wasn't it enough that Millie got hit by a car? Did you have to give her an emotional blow on top of it?"


Just thinking about it made her heart ache. She hadn't known until later that Millie hadn't just had a random accident-it had been intentional. Someone had tried to take her life. And Brandon, her husband,was a prime suspect.


"I told you someone hit her on purpose. I even asked if it was you. What more did you need?" Alexia's voice rose, trembling with emotion.
Brandon opened his mouth, wanting to say that he had thought they were putting on a show.


In the end, he said nothing.


But Giffard caught it. "Alexia told mne you thought she and Millie were faking it. Thnat it was all just a performance to trick you."


Brandon didn't respond. He just stared at Alexia, the reality still not sinking in.


"Brandon, my father may be the hospital director, but we don't misuse our resources," Giffard said,less heated than his sister but no less pointed. Each word struck like a blow.



"I came to you that day and spoke to you. I provoked you on purpose, yes. But ask yourself-your wife was hospitalized. Shouldn't you at least have gone to see her? If you'd just speak to your doctor or checked her records, you'd have known what she went through."


He looked directly into Brandon's bloodshot eyes.
"But you didn't. Not even once. Not during her entire hospital stay."


"He did show up, remember?" Alexia said with a sarcastic laugh. "Said he saw you and Millie together,hugging and everything."


"Oh right," Giffard nodded. "Thanks for reminding me."


"And even if you were with her, what did that matter?Brandon's been parading around with Vivian like a concerned partner. Meanwhile, you were only helping Millie because she could barely move! Let's not forget-Brandon's the one who pushed her down the stairs. And yet he still had the nerve to accuse her of pretending? After all the years she gave him, all the sacrifices? And she still got nothing in return. Giffard,he's just heartless."



Giffard added, "Which makes him a perfect match for that manipulative Vivian."


"You're absolutely right," Alexia snapped.
The siblings traded accusations, their anger a relentless tide.



The longer Brandon listened, the heavier everything felt.


Millie had been in the hospital for days. And he never visited.


She had fallen from the stairs because he had pushed her. It was chaotic, yes, and he didn't mean to. But the result was the same.


He had even accused her of only faking it.


His chest ached like it was being torn apart.


And her car accident...



"How was she injured?" Brandon finally asked, voice rough and hollow, like dry bark cracking underfoot.


Alexia's eyes flared again. "What do you think? She got hit by a car! But more importantly, you pushed her down the stairs right after that!"


"I didn't mean to," Brandon said quietly. "That day-" He wanted to explain. But when he saw the fury in Alexia's eyes, he stopped. It didn't matter.


Intentional or not, he had done it.


His thoughts flashed back to the hospital hallway.Millie had stood there, pale, with a bandage on her head,asking them what was going on.


And after she fell, he remembered her trembling voice calling his name. "Brandon."


It had been a long time since she'd said his name like that.



His vision blurred.


He kept seeing her smile. Her tears. And the night he told her about the divorce. How stunned she looked when she asked,"What about me?"


"Giffard," Alexia said bitterly, "some people only care about making excuses, 'I didn't mean to' and suddenly everything's forgiven? It doesn't work that way."
But Brandon didn't respond. He didn't even seem to hear.


It felt like all the air had been sucked out of the room.He couldn't breathe.
###Chapter 125 Do You Hold It Against Me
Millie's face lingered in Brandon's thoughts.


He remembered that day at the hospital, the white bandage wrapped around her head.


"At least her injuries weren't serious..." he whispered,relief in his voice.



Not everything was lost; if he explained things properly to her later on... Maybe she would find it in her heart to forgive him.



But Alexia was having none of it.


"Wasn't serious? Are you kidding me? You pushed her, did you forget?" Alexia stormed toward Brandon,ready to lash out. "Do you even realize that she-"


"Alexia!" Giffard caught her by the arm and pulled her back.
That only fueled Alexia's anger."So you're defending him now?"



Her mind kept flashing back to Millie, lying there,blood everywhere.


"How could you? You know as well as I do just how Millie has been getting by lately..." Alexia's eyes welled up, her words shaky.


Giffard answered with a slow shake of his head,quietly stopping her from continuing.



Brandon, lost in his own world, didn't even hear them talking. His attention was glued to Millie, just as she came out of an office nearby.


A warning came from Lynda. "They're still searching for you,so stay alert."


Millie managed a quiet response. "I will.ljust-"


At that moment, Brandon stepped up beside them.


"We need to talk." His eyes were rimmed red as he grabbed Millie's wrist tightly.
Lynda sized up the situation, glancing between Brandon and Millie with concern.



She was ready to step in if Millie said no.


Before Millie could answer, Brandon added, "I mean about the 9 a.m. tomorrow."


Millie had just gotten the full story from Alexia and Lynda.


At first, she believed there was nothing left for her and Brandon to discuss. Then he mentioned the"9a.m." matter. That was the time they had set to.collect their divorce decree.


Her right hand balled into a fist, but eventually, Millie gave a nod.



"Alright," she said.


With everything going on, she realized that if they didn't clear things up now, she might not get the divorce decree tomorrow.



Brandon offered a suggestion. "My car is parked outside. Let's have our talk there."
Without hesitation, Millie nodded.
Being at the police station gave her confidence that nothing would go wrong.
She flashed a small smile to Lynda and gave her a nod before heading out with Brandon.
Behind them,Alexia was filled with worry.
She turned to her brother. "Giffard, do you think Brandon will hurt Millie?"

He waved her concerns away. "This is the police station. Brandon isn't about to do anything rash."
That made sense.
Relief washed over Alexia, but she shot Giffard an annoyed look. "Why did you stop me earlier? Did Brandon even understand what was going on?|could wring his neck!"
With a sigh, Giffard met his sister's glare. "If you'd kept talking, you would have brought up Millie's

miscarriage. Millie wants out of the marriage now. If Brandon finds out about that, do you really think they'll still peacefully go through with the divorce tomorrow?"
Alexia frowned, not convinced. "He's crazy about Vivian, always taking her side. Would he even care about Millie's loss?"
Giffard shook his head slowly. "I doubt it."
That left Aexia staring at him, waiting for more.
Giffard simply shrugged and kept his thoughts to himself.
"Anyway, there's no need to make things harder than they are," he remarked.
Alexia gave a nod. "You're right about that."
Raising her head, she watched as Millie and Brandon moved farther away.
"I just can't help feeling bad for Millie," she whispered. "Seven years was no short time."
Giffard nodded along. Yes, how many stretches of seven years did a person really get?



...
Meanwhile,Millie followed Brandon out the door.
His car waited by the entrance to the police station.
Tall trees and a patchwork of moonlight made the night feel especially cool.
A gentle breeze rustled through, sending loose strands of Millie's hair fluttering.
Brandon glanced over at her, memories flashing back to that evening at Moonlit Estate when she seemed so small and fragile.
He reached out, meaning to neaten her hair, but she stepped back with a guarded look.
"There's hair out of place," Brandon remarked,a frown creasing his brow.
At what point had she grown so wary of him?
"I'll take care of it," Millie replied, smoothing her hair on her own.
They continued to the car, and Brandon held the door open for her to get in first.
Once inside, both chose the back seat, and an uneasy quiet settled between them.
Streetlights glimmered beyond the windows, and the woods outside sat in hushed darkness.
Neither of them said a word.

Seconds slipped by in silence.
Brandon finally broke it after a while.
" know," he retorted, his gaze fixed on the dark woods ahead. "I know about your car accident."
Millie offered a quiet nod."Alright."
"Back at the stair well that day, I swear I never meant for things to turn out the way they did," said Brandon. He wasn't sure if saying it would matter now, but he couldn't stay silent. "Everything was a mess. I was trying to hold Alexia back, stop her from swinging, and pull her away from Vivian, but they kept thrashing around. They wouldn't stop. I had to push harder just to keep them apart. Then... I don't even know how it happened. Somewhere in the middle of it all, I shoved you. I reached out, I really did, but it all happened too fast. And then you were falling."

He kept his eyes trained on the trees outside, unable to look at Millie.
He had no idea how she would take this, but he felt.he owed her an explanation.
Millie listened quietly and only replied, "Alright."
The silence between them returned.
What Brandon couldn't see was the way Milie's hands curled into tight fists, her fingers pressing so hard into her palms that it hurt.
She focused on keeping her face calm,forcing her thoughts away from the baby she'd lost and those long,bitter days after that.


Her mind kept repeating that everything was finished now, that she would pull through, that better days were ahead. At least she had Ari now, and the two of them could find happiness.


If she stayed strong, got the divorce decree, won the championship at Heavenly Melody, and sorted out the contract with Brandon to bring back the loyal team that had once worked for the Bennett family...everything would be alright. She would make things right.


Even after losing two children, Ari was still by her side.



A few more moments passed before Brandon spoke up again. "How's your injury?"


At last, Brandon turned to face her.


It hit him then-Millie still hadn't put the weight back on.



From where he sat, he could make out the sharp line of her collarbone, the dip at the center of her chest,and the delicate limbs that seemed almost too light for the rest of her.

"It's healed," said Millie.

Brandon gave a quiet nod. "That's good to hear."

He hesitated, and then added, "I should've come to see you at the hospital. I didn't."
Millie said nothing.

"Do you... hold it against me?" he asked, eyes downcast, watching her out of the corner of his eye.

###Chapter 126 Millie, Do You Love Me
Milliewanted to lie. She wanted to say, "No, I don't,"just to make things easier. Just to get through the day and walk away with the divorce papers tomorrow.


But when she thought about the baby she lost, the tanzanite he took, and all the love she had poured into him, the words simply wouldn't come.


How could she not blame him?



Her emotions churned inside her like a storm she couldn't calm.



"Millie." Brandon called her again."Answer me."


His eyes were slightly red when he asked, "Do you blame me?"



Millie turned her head and took a deep breath. Her eyes were wet. She looked at him. He looked just the same as she remembered. In his eyes, maybe there had been guilt once.


"Millie..." he whispered.


She pressed her fingers hard into her palm, trying to hold herself together.


Then she steadied hervoice and said, "What do you think?"



Just four words-but they cut deep.


Brandon opened his mouth, but no sound came.


He stared at her. Her eyes shimmered with tears.


He slowly looked away.


"You should blame me," he said.


Outside the car, the wind rustled through the trees.


"I know you're angry," Brandon said quietly, his gaze fixed on the swaying branches. "And you should be.I hurt you because of Vivian." He paused. "But Millie, I had my reasons."


She stayed quiet, watching him. Then, suddenly,she let out a soft laugh.


Of course. He always had his reasons. His dilemmas.


But what about her?


Did he ever stop to think about what she meant to him?


"Lately, I've been thinking a lot about the past,"Brandon said. "Sometimes, I feel lost. Like things shouldn't have turned out this way. I remember when we first got together... Our first kiss... You curled up in my arms saying you loved me and that we'd always be together."



His voice softened. "I remember how hard we worked. How we agreed to move forward together.That we couldn't keep holding on to the old ways.We fought to change Watson Group. We led the team,broke through technical barriers, and earned contracts overseas. I remember those days, Millie.Side by side, through thick and thin. And.."His voice broke."And the baby we lost."
Brandon's nose stung. He couldn't keep his voice steady anymore. He stared blankly at the trees outside.
He stopped talking.
Millie sighed gently, still not looking at him. Her eyes turned to the other window.
She tried to control her breathing. Tried to stay calm."You said you'd stay with me. And you did. But what l promised you... I haven't done that. But I will. I'll be your support. Just like I promised," Brandon replied.
"Millie," he said again.
Millie didn't answer. She just kept her gaze on the rain-streaked window, hiding her face.
The past they shared... It had been beautiful.
They had faced so much together. Leaned on each other. Survived it all.
She used to believe that after all those years-after all those nights-they would walk through life hand in hand.That they would be each other's forever.


But not long after they got married... He fell for someone else.


Seven years. Defeated by a few fleeting months with Vivian.


She had lost. Or maybe... She just never truly understood him.



She didn't know anymore.


"Trust me, okay?" Brandon said quietly.


Millie lowered her eyes. She took a long breath."What about Vivian?" she asked.



Her voice dropped to a whisper, "Brandon, how do you expect me to trust you after everything?"


The silence that followed was heavy.


Millie bit her lip, holding herself back.


Then Brandon said, "She only has five months. After that... Everything will go back to normal."
Millie let out a hollow laugh. Tears finally rolled down her cheeks. "Brandon, do you really think I'm that cheap? That I'd just stand by while you're with her,and say nothing?"


She looked straight at him.


Did he really expect her to forgive everything? To forget the affair? To come back to him five months later like nothing ever happened? As if the fact that he left her for another woman never existed?


Millie nearly voiced all of this. But tomorrow, they'd get divorced.


That thought held her back.


All she said was, "You were the one who asked for a divorce a month ago. So tell me, Brandon... How can you expect me to trust you? What do you take me for?"



Brandon frowned. He reached out to wipe her tears,but she pushed his hand away.


"I take you as my wife," he said softly, watching her turn away.


"Not after tomorrow," she muttered.


"What if I don't go through with it? The divorce isn't final yet. Until we get that paper, Millie... we're still married," Brandon said quickly.


A flash of lightning split the sky, followed by deep,rumbling thunder.


Then came the rain, tapping gently on the windows.


Millie turned to look at him, her face serious.


His eyes, bloodshot and sorrowful, met hers.


They stared at each other, as if trying to find the truth. But their hearts had grown too far apart. They could no longer see clearly.


"And what about her? Vivian. She's dying, isn't she?"Millie asked.



Brandon's eyes flickered. He didn't know how to answer.He closed his eyes and leaned back.
Outside, the rain fell harder. Alexia and Giffard stood under umbrellas, quietly discussing whether to come get Millie.


Brandon finally said, "Five months. Just wait five months.Everything will be back to normal."


Millie didn't respond. She just stared at him, heart aching.


So...He really did love Vivian.


Alexia and Giffard began walking toward them,holding umbrellas borrowed from the station.


Alexia tapped on the car door. "Are you two done talking?"


"We're done," Millie said, reaching for the door.


Just as her hand touched the handle, Brandon spoke. "Millie, do you love me?"
###Chapter 127 Did She Still Agree To The Divorce
Millie glanced at Brandon, but his eyes stayed on the rain sliding down the window. He didn't look at her.


"Yeah," she said softly.



She did love him. But that was then. Now, she had chosen to stop loving him.



There was no reason to say it aloud though-no need to stir up emotions before tomorrow.



Brandon turned his head just in time to see Millie stepping out into the rain.


The Bennett family's ties still randeep in the Watson Group, and digging into James' death would take the right connections.



She needed him. She needed the Watson name.
Brandon believed that in five months, when he told her everything, she would understand. He believed she still loved him. That she couldn't live without him.Now Millie was already walking ahead with Giffard and Alexia, disappearing into the rain.
The downpour was heavy. Even with an umbrella, her clothes clung to her skin.
"I'll go get the car," Giffard said.
Alexia handed over the keys to him.
He jogged off, umbrella in hand, while Millie and Alexia waited under the shelter of a nearby roof.
Millie brushed rain from her pants. Alexia noticed the redness in her eyes and hesitated before asking,"What did he say to you?"
"Just things from the past. He also talked about the accident... And said he didn't push me on purpose,"Milie said calmly.
Alexia's face tightened. "You're not thinking of forgiving him, are you? He's awful, Millie. He hurt you so badly."


Millie shook off the last drops of rain and stood up straight. She smiled gently and patted Alexia's shoulder. "No chance I'll ever forgive him. Tomorrow morning at 9, we're getting the divorce decree," she said.



Alexia studied her face, looking for any sign of hesitation. Seeing none, she finally exhaled.


She squeezed MMillie's hand. "You've been through enough. Don't look back. He's not worth it."


Millie felt a dull ache in her chest. She held Alexia's hand tighter and nodded, "I know."


Soon,Giffard pulled up.


They returned the umbrellas to the kind officer,and then climbed into the car.



Meanwhile, Eugene borrowed an umbrella and walked over to Brandon.
"Mr. Watson, how did it go with Mrs. Watson?"Eugene asked as he got into the driver's seat and wiped the rain off.


Brandon didn't answer. He just stared out the window at the rain. He wasn't even sure how he felt.


Seeing this, Eugene didn't press further. He drove off, returned the umbrella, and had a few words with Brandon's lawyer. Then, he turned the car around and headed back with Brandon.



The rain kept pouring. At home, Vivian paced the floor.





She'd been trying to reach someone, but the line wouldn't connect.



The last message she got said trouble was coming and he might go dark for a while. He also claimed he had cleaned things up for her.



"Damn it!" Vivian cursed under her breath.



"What do you mean, 'cleaned up'?" she muttered,eyes glued to the news on TV.
The person who'd been hit by the car was still
critical. The police were already searching for the suspect.
Even if he got away, he wouldn't be able to move freely in the city again.
And now, the hunt had begun.
"Thank God for this rain. Maybe it'll wash away some evidence," Vivian murmured.
With that, she lay on the bed.
Her thoughts drifted to Brandon.
"Tomorrow... They should be able to get the divorce done smoothly, right?" she whispered.
She had it all planned. Once the divorce papers were signed, she'd marry Brandon.
It was her "last wish." And Brandon had to agree.Then she'd finally be his wife.
That thought lit up her face with a hopeful smile.
The rain drenched the city, soaking every corner.


Giffard and Alexia dropped Millie off at her apartment.




She had taken a taxi earlier, so her car was still parked at home.


"Should I stay with you?" Alexia asked, her voice laced with worry.


Millie shook her head. "No need. You were frightened today. Go home, take a hot shower, relax a bit, and sleep well. Don't catch a cold."


Alexia nodded. Truth be told, she might just wake Millie up with a nightmare if she stayed.


"We'll get going then. Call me if anything happens,"she said with concern.



Millie smiled and nodded to reassure her.


She stood quietly after they drove off, and then turned and walked slowly to the elevator, her steps heavy.







In another car, Eugene asked carefully, "Mr. Watson,where should we go now?"



Brandon didn't answer right away.


Eugene sighed.


Just then, Brandon's phone vibrated.


He glanced at the screen. It was Vivian.


He hesitated, but then answered, recalling something.





"Brandon," Vivian said shyly.


"Yeah," he replied.


"Where are you now?" she asked.


"I'm in the car," Brandon said flatly.


"You're not with Millie, are you? I saw some gossip online about... your dinner with her tonight," she pressed.


"No. I'm with Eugene," Brandon replied.


Eugene added smoothly, "Miss Simpson, we're heading back now."



Vivian let out a breath.


Then she said softly, "Sorry, Brandon...I got jealous."


Brandon didn't respond. He kept watching the rain roll down the glass.


"Did she still agree to the divorce?" Vivian asked after a pause.


"Yes," he answered.


"That's good," Vivian whispered. Silence followed.Then, she said, "Brandon... Where are you going now? Do you want me to stay with you tonight?"


Brandon lowered his gaze. "It's been a long day.I just want to be alone."


"Oh... Okay. Take good care of yourself," Vivian replied.
"I will," he said, and then hung up.
The call ended. Brandon suddenly felt drained.
The day had dragged on endlessly.
The Maybach rolled through the rain.
"To Serenity Villa," Brandon instructed.
"Yes, Mr. Watson," Eugene said, setting the GPS.They arrived soon after.
Brandon stepped out, crossed the wet courtyard,and entered the house. He turned on all the lights.Still, the place felt hollow.
He didn't go to the bedroom. He lay down on the sofa instead.
Staring at the ceiling, he felt like he didn't belong to this world.
His phone buzzed again.
He looked at it.



The clock had just struck midnight.
###Chapter 128 New Beginnings
It was a restless night for nearly everyone.
Police combed the area,relentless in their search.
At the hospital, doctors and nurses worked nonstop to stabilize the patient.
Vivian managed to gather a few details through quiet inquiries.
Charles couldn't bring himseIf to call Millie. Instead,he reached out to Alexia. But even after hearing everything from her, the tension in hischest refused to ease.
He paced for a while before finally settling at his desk, trying to bury his nerves in company work.
Brandon remained on the sofa, eyes wide open,unable to sleep.
His thoughts wandered aimlessly. At some point,he stepped outside, standing beneath the overhang,silently watching the sky fade from black to grey. The ashtray near the chair was stuffed with cigarette stubs.


Millie stayed in bed, the curtains drawn wide.She lay quietly, staring at the heavy rainfall tapping against the window.


When dawn broke, the rain let up.


She checked the clock. It was still early, but she didn't feel like staying in bed. She decided to pick Ari up sooner than planned.


After getting dressed and gathering her things,she left for the children's home.


Elsewhere, at the Elliott estate, rain still dripped steadily from the edges of the roof.


The study smelled of fresh coffee. Myron sat with a book in hand.


Jayceon,having just woken, stretched out his arms as he descended the stairs. As he passed by, he glanced into the study.


"You're already up?" he asked, stifling a yawn as he walked in.


Myron, still reading, didn't reply right away.


He closed the book after he finished the ###Chapter, set it aside, picked up his coffee, and took a slow sip.His eyes settled on the courtyard, where the rain had begun to ease.



---


Across the city, the streets buzzed with motion as people started their day.


Though the rain had ended just in time, the morning traffic remained jammed.


Millie had set out early, which allowed her to pick Ari up ahead of schedule. They spent some time playing at a quiet park before Millie dropped her off at kindergarten.


Once done, she made her way to the courthouse.
She pulled into the parking lot, the documents needed resting on the seat beside her.


Would Brandon show up on time today? She wasn't sure,she could only wait and see.


A glance at her phone told her it was already 8:50a.m.




Still no message from him.


As time crawled, at 8:55, just as she checked her screen again, a car horn sounded nearby.


She looked up to see a Maybach pulling into a spot not far from her.



It was Brandon.



He hnad come.



Millie inhaled quietly, grabbed the documents, and stepped out of her car. She walked over to the Maybach and knocked on the passenger-side window.



The glass lowered, revealing Brandon's face.
A shadow of stubble had formed around his mouth and he hadn't changed out of the clothes he'd worn the day before.
"It's nearly time. Did you bring everything?" Millie asked, leaning slightly as she spoke.
Brandon stayed quiet.
Millie's brow twitched as she watched him, unsure what was going through his mind.
After a pause, he gave a small nod.
"Yeah," he murmured.
He reached over, gathered his documents, and climbed out of the car.
They didn't speak as they walked side by side toward the courthouse.
A few couples were already ahead of them,so they joined the line and waited.
More people arrived, some bickering in low voices,others standing in silence like they were.

Brandon shifted his attention to Millie.


She was still small in stature, flipping through the papers she'd brought with her.


Her hands were delicate, her ring finger bare.


He lowered his gaze, pulled off his own wedding ring,and slipped it into his pocket.


Millie noticed but said nothing, offering him only a brief look.



She had already left her ring, and the bottle of perfume he'd once given her, in the drawer before leaving their shared home.


"Keep it for the remarriage," Brandon murmured.


Millie didn't reply. She kept reading.


"I'll buy you a better one next time," he added,maybe thinking she was annoyed and trying to reassure her.


Millie stayed quiet, her eyes lowered. She didn't want him to catch even a glimpse of what she was feeling.
Her silence drew a faint crease between Brandon's brows.


She looked drained. The shadows beneath her eyes hinted at a sleepless night.


"Try to get some rest in the days ahead," he said, his voice low.


Millie looked up briefly and saw the dark circles beneath his eyes.


"Alright," she murmured, bowing her head again. "I'll take care of myself."


Nothing more was said after that.


They stood in silence.


Soon,it was their turn.


They stepped up to the counter and passed over the required documents.


As the clerk flipped through the paperwork, the two of them sat quietly.
Eventually, the clerk looked up. "Have you both made up your minds?"


"We have," they answered together, nodding.


With practiced hands, the clerk processed the forms and printed the final documents.


"Here you are," the clerk said, handing them each a divorce certificate and accompanying materials before calling the next couple forward.


Millie and Brandon stepped away from the counter,each holding a copy of their divorce certificate.


Millie stared at the piece of paper in her hand.


This marked the end of their marriage.


A strange sense of relief washed over her-clearer and sharper than she expected.


Now,everything could move forward.


The chaos that trailed behind Serena in the Heavenly Melody competition, the agreement she had signed with Brandon to ensure her rights, even the evidence of his affair she had once prepared as a last resort,none of it lingered over her anymore.


And Ari, she belonged to her now, without question.


All that remained was to win the championship in that show.


Millie had originally planned to disclose her identity right after receiving the divorce decree. But with Brandon and the Elliott family tightening their grip on the show and on Serena's position, an early reveal wasn't necessary anymore.


She'd wait until the finals. She'd pull off the mask when the cameras were rolling and leave no room for retaliation.


For now,Serena's image was being dragged through the mud online. But it wouldn't last.


At the finals, when she revealed who she really was,every rumor would crumble.


Millie's thoughts raced, her next steps falling into place.
Brandon was staring at his copy of the divorce certificate as well, though his thoughts couldn't have been further from Millie's.



Outwardly, they both looked composed as they stepped through the courthouse doors, neither showing any sign of emotion.


The sun had risen high, casting warmth over the pavement.


"Well, that's it. We're officially divorced," Brandon said as they stood on the steps.


Millie gave a slight nod.


"In a few days, there's a music show final airing," he continued. "It's called 'Heavenly Melody.' You might like it. One of the contestants-Serena-she's really good. Talented and sharp. Her style reminds me of yours, only more polished. I admire her work.Thought you might want to watch and learn a few things. I've set aside a seat for you at the live show."He looked at her. "Think you'll come?"
Millie met his eyes. "I'll be there."
"Not with the audience though." Millie thought.
Brandon gave a short nod.
There was nothing else to say.
Millie studied him for a moment, a quiet calm settling over her.
"Well then," she said, "here's to new beginnings.
###Chapter 129 Would You Consider Accepting My Proposal Of Marriage
Brandon remained silent, his face betraying a maze of conflicted emotions as he studied Millie's features.


"I'll come find you in five months," he declared with quiet determination.0


Millie offered no concrete response to his promise.


"Let's just go," she said, taking charge as she began her descent down the courthouse steps.


Brandon remained frozen on the steps, his gaze following Millie's retreating figure. He watched as the morning sunlight painted her silhouette in wvarm,golden hues, and without warning, an inexplicable wave of melancholy washed over him.


His phone buzzed in his pocket at that precise moment.
 He retrieved the device and discovered Vivian's name illuminating the caller display.


His other hand clutched the freshly signed divorce decree that legally severed his bond with Millie.


When he lifted his eyes again, Millie had already vanished around the corner, swallowed by the shadows.



Brandon gave his head a sharp shake, attempting to banish the peculiar emotions that threatened to overwhelm his rational thinking.


Millie harbored deep feelings for himn. She would never abandon their connection.



Besides, Vivian's remaining time stretched only five months into the future.



The wait wouldn't stretch on indefinitely.


With these reassuring thoughts anchoring his resolve, Brandon accepted Vivian's incoming call.


"Brandon." Vivian's familiar voice drifted through the speaker. "Did everything proceed according to plan?"


Brandon's eyes dropped to the document resting in his palm.



"Yes," he responded with measured certainty.






Meanwhile, Millie settled into her vehicle's driver seat and allowed herself a moment of quiet reflection.She extracted her copy of divorce decree from her purse,captured a clear photograph, and shared the image within her close-knit group chat.


Her fingers typed swiftly. "Successfully obtained the divorce decree."



Enthusiastic congratulations flooded her screen almost instantaneously.


Alexia responded immediately, "That's absolutely wonderful! Good riddance to him! He's nothing but a complete scoundrel!"
Charles contributed his thoughts. "Millie, you're absolutely incredible! You finally freed yourself from that foolish Brandon!"



Seville chimed in with enthusiasm. "This is fantastic!Congratulations to you, Millie, for embracing a brand new ###Chapter!"


Giffard echoed the sentiment. "Congratulations to you, Millie, on reclaiming your independence! Good riddance to dead weight!"


Sheridan also added his heartfelt support, saying,"This is truly magnificent! At last, all your suffering has reached its end. Congratulations,Millie!"


Charles continued with growing excitement, "Let's gather for dinner tonight. I'll secure our reservations!Such a momentous occasion deserves a fitting celebration!"


Millie absorbed her friends' heartfelt congratulatory messages, feeling genuine warmth spreading through her chest, and typed several grateful responses.

After some time passed, she set her phone aside and prepared to drive away from the courthouse.


However, at that exact moment, she noticed a familiar figure positioned beside her vehicle.


She couldn't determine how long he had maintained his vigil there, but when he observed her glancing upward, he raised his hand to signal her.


The figure turned out to be Myron.


What possible reason could he have for lingering beside her car?



Millie found his presence peculiar and unsettling.She reflected on their history; beyond their previous confrontations in the competitive corporate world,she maintained virtually no personal relationship with Myron.



Even their business interactions had occurred while she represented Brandon's interests.


Beyond her existence as Millie, another identity that had crossed paths with him was Serena.
However, Serena maintained her anonymity behind a mask, and Myron had attended the live performance solely because of his siblings' involvement.


These rapid-fire thoughts blazed through her consciousness in a single heartbeat before she lowered her car window and offered Myron a carefully composed smile.


"Mr. Elliott, is there something specific you require assistance with?" Millie inquired with practiced politeness.


Myron observed Millie's seemingly clueless expression and discovered it rather entertaining.


"Care to have a conversation?" Myron suggested with a casual chuckle thatdidn't quite reach his eyes.


Millie remained uncertain about Myron's true intentions behind this unexpected encounter.


Throughout Crobert's sophisticated social landscape, three enormously influential families wielded unprecedented power-the Watsons, the  Evans, and the Elliotts.


The Watson dynasty, commanded by Brandon's iron fist, had undergone a complete strategic metamorphosis that enabled them to systematically outmaneuver their two primary rivals.


The Evans empire and the Elliott corporation remained locked in an intensely competitive struggle for second place.


However, these two powerful dynasties had adopted completely contrasting philosophies when grooming their future leaders.



The Evans household embraced a ruthless competitive framework, with Charles and his brothers engaging in fierce, relentless battles to determine the ultimate successor.



The Elliott dynasty, in stark contrast, had orchestrated their three siblings to collaborate harmoniously while expanding and fortifying the Elliott Group's foundations.
Yet Millie understood that the surface dynamics masked far more complex undercurrents.


Although Jayceon projected an image of guileless simplicity, his birth into such rarefied social strata meant he could never truly remain naive about the world's darker machinations.


The Elliott empire, which specialized in precious gemstones and exclusive luxury merchandise,wielded considerable influence throughout Crobert's business landscape. As heirs to this legacy, both Adriana and Jayceon possessed formidable capabilities that commanded respect.


Anyone capable of compelling both Jayceon_ and Adriana to demonstrate such unwavering deference must possess power that demanded serious consideration.


Traditionally,Elliott family matters received resolution through Jayceon and Adriana's combined efforts,while Myron maintained an almost enigmatic presence in the shadows.
The business community knew only scattered details about him-his twenty-nine years of life, his extended period roaming abroad, and his recent return to assume direct control of the Elliott Group's operations.


Weighing these intricate considerations, Millie concluded that gathering intelligence should take priority and responded, "Perhaps we could arrange this for another occasion?"


Myron's enigmatic smile remained firmly in place as he countered, "Would you be willing to spare just a few precious moments for me?"


He allowed a deliberate pause to settle between them before adding, "Millie, or perhaps I should address you as Serena?"


Millie's cheerful expression crystallized into momentary stillness before she expertly restored her composed facade.


"Mr. Elliott, you must be mistaken," Millie responded with practiced grace. "Although I've indeed heard  whispers recently about this Serena-she seems to have quite remarkable vocal talents?"



Myron declined her deflection with a gentle shake of his head, his smile never wavering. "There exists no confusion whatsoever. From the moment I accompanied Jayceon to that particular event and saw your performance, I've been aware of your true identity.Subsequently, I invested considerable effort into thorough investigation, and during the third live show, I attended once more to solidify my conclusions.Do I have to continue?"


He continued to regard her with that same disarming smile,radiating an aura of effortless sophistication.


However, Millie refused to underestimate the danger he represented.


His ability to articulate such precise details served as irrefutable proof that he had indeed confirmed her carefully guarded secret identity.


Millie recognized that avoiding this conversation today would prove impossible.
 She offered a resigned nod. "Very well then."


"Let's continue our discussion over coffee," Myron suggested with refined politeness. "I happen to know a nice place."


Millie acknowledged his proposal,emerged from her vehicle, and followed Myron toward a nearby coffeehouse that exuded both seclusion and sophisticated elegance.


"Good morning,Mr.Elliott."


"Mr. Elliott, what a pleasant surprise!"


Patrons throughout the establishment offered.Myron warm,respectful greetings.


Their recognition of his presence was unmistakably evident.


Myron responded to their acknowledgments with gracious nods of appreciation.


Millie, her mind buzzing with countless questions,trailed silently behind Myron's confident stride.
Eventually, the pair arrived at an impeccably appointed private chamber.


After their carefully selected coffees had been expertly served, the chamber door closed with a soft,decisive click.


"Mr. Elliott, what sparked this sudden fascination with my affairs? And what motivated you to conduct such thorough investigations into my background?"The coffee's rich fragrance permeated the intimate space,delicate steam spiraling upward as Millie fixed her gaze on Myron and posed her pointed inquiry.


Myron refrained from providing an immediate response, instead savoring a contemplative sip of his expertly prepared coffee.


"Our paths have crossed on numerous occasions,though you consistently remained positioned at Brandon's side during those encounters," Myron observed with measured deliberation.


Millie confirmed his observation with a subtle nod.That assessment was undeniably accurate.
He pressed forward with his explanation. "I always believed Brandon possessed extraordinary fortune in securing your devotion. I must confess... I consistently harbored envy toward him."


Millie studied his expression intently, struggling to decipher the deeper meaning behind his unexpected confession.


" also attended that prestigious charity auction,"Myron continued with growing intensity. "That evening, Serena's masterful technique in escalating the bidding war represented a brilliant demonstration of strategic thinking, which immediately captured my intense curiosity. However, when I learned that Serena was reportedly Charles' romantic partner, l experienced genuine disappointment but chose not to pursue the matter further until Jayceon convinced me to witness Serena's live performance. Her performance revealed certain inconsistencies that troubled me, and subsequently, as I just explained, I did some digging and then confirmed your carefully concealed identity."
 So the charity auction had served as the catalyst for his investigation.


Millie lowered her gaze slightly, processing this revelation with growing unease.


"So, what specific purpose brought you to seek me out today, Mr. Elliott?" she inquired with cautious directness.


"Please, simply address me as Myron," he responded, his smile radiating unexpected warmth."First, allow me to offer my/sincere congratulations on your successful divorce proceedings. And secondly, would you consider accepting my proposal of marriage?"
###Chapter 130 Let's Go Get Married





Millie studied Myron, her gaze tracing the delicate swirl of steam rising from his coffee.


Through that soft haze, she took in the faint lines of exhaustion around his eyes.


"Why?" she asked quietly, her voice steady.


He didn't seem disappointed when she ignored the cup he'd offered. Myron simply set it onthe table between them, poured himself a fresh serving,and regarded her with gentle sincerity.


"I admire you," he admitted, his tone unwavering."And I like you.Honestly."


The confession didn't stir her.



The ache of her recent divorce was still too raw; no amount of admiration could make her want to leap blindly into another relationship tight away.
"I just don't get it," Millie replied, lifting her eyes to meet his. "There are plenty of other women you could pursue. I'm nothing special."
He shook his head, conviction in every line of his face."You're wrong.You are special. There's no one else like you."

Millie hesitated, unsure how to answer.
The air between them turned oddly heavy.
"I'm sorry," she said after a long pause, her voice gentle but firm. "I just can't think about any of this.right now."
Her gaze drifted to the untouched coffee cooling on the table.
Who brought up marriage like this-over a casual cup of coffee?
She'd barely finalized her divorce; all she wanted was a little peace.
The idea of a second marriage was a question for  another time.


There was Ari to worry about now-her daughter came first, always.


It wasn't just her own future at stake.


Right now, her focus belonged elsewhere, like preparing for the Heavenly Melody finals, and taking the agreement she and Brandon signed to the lawyer.She needed to fight for what remained of the Bennett family's old business.


Myron glanced at Millie, his gaze steady and,unhurried, a gentle warmth lingering in his eyes.


"If marriage is out of the question, what about a partnership instead?" he offered, his voice as calm as ever.



Millie arched a brow, caught off guard. "A partnership?"





He replied with a nod, unruffled, "You're divorced,but everyone still sees you as Brandon's ex-wife.And you know as well as I do, once Vivian is gone,
Brandon will try to win you back. How do you plan to handle that?"


His tone was rational, almost soothing. "Maybe you and Charles want to stand together and help each other get ahead. But you know it's not that simple.Charles needs time, and he's up against Reuben and Oakley-neither of them are easy opponents. The Watson Group is too powerful for him right now.And you... As capable as you are, Millie, one person cannot take on an entire corporation alone."


He leaned forward, voice even and direct. "Say you try to stall for time-how long can you keep it up?"


Myron laid out the facts without a hint of accusation,just honest concern.



He understood that proposing marriage so suddenly might seem inappropriate, but the truth was, too many men already wanted Millie for themselves. He couldn't afford to hold back any longer, not if he hoped to stand a chance.


"My apologies," Myron went on, his voice gentle but steady. "Maybe it was out of line to bring up marriage so soon. That's not my only solution. There are other ways to give you some protection. If marriage feels too much, we could get engaged, or I could simply act as your boyfriend in public."


Millie sat in silence, her gaze fixed on the steaming coffee,lost in thought.


She could see Myron wasn't wrong.


Myron waited, and then offered, "Three months.Let's just try this for twelve weeks-one meeting each week. We don't have to force anything. You don't have to pressure yourself to feel anything for me. But during that time, if there are rumors about us, or if people assume we'll engaged soon, it might shield you from a lot of trouble. And if, after three months, you want nothing to do with me, we'll walk away,no strings attached."


She observed him across the table, taking in his composed expression as the scent of coffee drifted between them.
Myron looked as collected as ever, unfazed by his own bold proposal.


The arrangement sounded strangely appealing.


Still, she couldn't help but ask, "Why are you doing this? Is it really just because you like me?"


She frowned, searching his face for a hint of deeper motive. She honestly couldn't imagine what about her could inspire that kind of devotion.


"If you want another reason..." Myron's smile curved with a hint of mischief. "Let's just say I'd rather not make things so easy for Brandon-or the Watson Group."


He leaned in, his tone softening. "You probably don't realize it, Millie, but I envy him. Not because of his money or his status. Not even the Watson Group.I envy the fact that he once had someone who gave him everything-someone who'd risk it all just for him."



Millie's gaze dropped to the table.
Risk everything, just for him?


Wasn't that just foolishness?


She'd done it. Seven years, and what did she have to show for it?


"I'll think about it," she murmured, her voice low with exhaustion. "I can't give you an answer right now."


She just felt so tired.



Seven years with Brandon had drained her. The idea of diving into a new relationship left her hollow and wary.


She wondered if she was even capable of falling in love again.



Marriage without love? The thought also made her chest tighten.


"Excuse me," Millie murmured, giving a polite nod before she quietly rose and walked away.


Myron remained in his seat, watching her retreat.
The coffee she'd left behind sat untouched,wisps of steam curling in the morning light. He gazed at the cup, a gentle smile tugging at his lips.


If she no longer believed she could love, maybe he could be the one to love her first.



---


After leaving the cafe, MMillie sank into the driver's seat of her car and exhaled, letting the tension slip away.


At least she didn't have to deal with Myron pressing her for answers anymore.Everything else could wait.


For now, she'd finally closed the ###Chapter on her marriage, and that was something worth celebrating.



·.·


Meanwhile, Brandon had already returned to the Watson Group's headquarters.


He ordered Eugene the day before to clear his calendar. So when Eugene spotted him walking in,he was genuinely taken aback.


"Mr. Watson, what brings you back?" Eugene asked,eyeing him with barely concealed worry.


"You don't look so good. Should I call a doctor?"


Brandon brushed him off with a dismissive wave.


"No need. Go ahead and get ready. We'll go on with those meetings."


Eugene opened his mouth, hesitating, almost asking about the divorce, but Brandon's expression left no room for questions.


"Understood," Eugene said at once, moving quickly to carry out the order.


Brandon endured back-to-back meetings all morning,a storm cloud shadowing his every move.


No one dared cross him.


After each session, the employees would scatter,their voices dropping to urgent whispers behind closed doors.
"Did you see Mr. Watson today? The secretary's office said he'd canceled all his schedules and taken the day off-so why is he back here, looking like that?"


"Yeah, I noticed. Typically, Mr. Watson is very particular about his appearance. He's never shown up unshaven before. And did you see the wrinkles in his shirt? Something must have happened. He looks exhausted."


"Maybe he had another fight with Vivian?"


"Who can say? All I know is, when Mrs. Watson was still around, he was never this out of sorts."


"That's right..."


"Cut the damn nonsense!" Eugene shut down their whispering with a warning glance. "Don't start rumors about Mr. Watson, unless you want to lose your jobs."


The crowd fell silent, muttering apologies before slipping away.
Out of sight, Brandon pressed his lips together, a faint line of tension crossing his face.


He lingered in the shadows for a moment longer, and then turned away, his footsteps echoing quietly down the hall.


The morning had been relentless.


Brandon, running on fumes after a sleepless night,felt fatigue clawing at him.


He slumped back into his leather chair, hoping for a brief reprieve. Just then, the office door swung open,breaking the quiet. Footsteps approached, brisk and deliberate.


"Brandon," a familiar voice called out.


He blinked awake to find Vivian standing in front of him, her lips curled into a bright, almost triumphant smile.



"Let's go get married," Vivian announced, her tone light but unmistakably bold.
###Chapter 131 A Promise Of A Lifetime





Vivian pulled a folder from her bag. "I brought all the paperwork we'll need. I even put on some makeup-do I look a little healthier now?" she asked.


A comfortable warmth filled the CEO's office, and Vivian's smile gave her a certain charm.


Her face showed more color than usual, not nearly as washed out as before.



Hope lit up her eyes.


Still...


Whether it was exhaustion or something deeper,Brandon couldn't bring himself to go through with a marriage today.


"Let's wait for another day," Brandon said quietly, his eyes dropping to avoid seeing the letdown in Vivian's expression.
He rubbed his forehead. "I'm pretty worn out. And getting married still takes a little planning, doesn't it?"



Vivian took in Brandon's tired face, his stubble showing, and saw just how drained he was. She decided not to push him further.


Yet she longed for the day everything would be official, eager to call herself Brandon's wife.


She couldn't wait for the chance to parade her happiness in front of Millie, eager to see jealousy and pain in Millie's eyes.


Thinking about that moment, Vivian spoke again."Brandon, we don't need a big celebration. No ceremony, no party. I just want you. That's enough for me."


Brandon still kept his gaze away from her.


"I understand you're exhausted, and there's been so much going on," Vivian added softly. "I can be patient. Just... please don't make me wait forever.
Don't let me down,okay?"


Vivian spoke with a calm kindness in her voice, the sort that left Brandon feeling slightly disarmed and unsure of how to respond.


Finally, he managed a faint nod, giving his silent agreement.


Vivian gave a bright smile. "Alright, Brandon, get some rest. I'll let you be for now," she said."What do you think about havingdinner together tonight?"


Brandon gave a small nod, and only then did Vivian turn and leave.


As he watched Vivian walk away, a wave of conflicting emotions stirred inside him.


His mind drifted back to the memory of him and Millie beside his grandfather, sharing a solemn promise for his gravely ill grandfather's ears.


Brandon slipped his hand into his pocket and slowly pulled out the wedding ring, holding it in his palm for a moment.
The light bounced off its surface, casting a chilly shine.


He'd bought the set in a hurry that day, on the way back to Watson Mansion.


After picking them out quickly, he slipped one ring onto Millie's finger, and she beamed with happiness,gently taking the other ring from his hand to slide it onto his finger herself.


"Now, this is forever," she had said, her hand-now bearing a ring-holding his, and her eyes shiing with joy.


That smile seemed like a distant memory now.


Thankfully, even though Millie had taken off her ring,he still had it.


Brandon held onto the hope that,one day, when they remarried, he'd put it on her again.






Elsewhere, Millie left Myron behind and headed straight to Evans Entertainment.


She had already arranged with the designer to come check her outfit for the finals.



Once she changed into the costume, Millie pulled on the matching mask.


The reflection in the mirror made her smile with satisfaction.



Standing nearby, the designer gave an approving nod as well.


"Try moving around a bit, and check if the joints work wel," the designer instructed.


Millie went through her dance routine, the flexible joints of the costume allowing her to move with ease.


"Looks perfect." They both agreed,pleased with the results.



"I really can't wait to watch you take the stage in this," the designer said, eyes shining with excitement.
A smile spread across Millie's face as she nodded,sharing in the anticipation.


"But Serena, there's a lot of criticism online right now. Are you sure you're alright?" the designer asked, concern creeping into their voice.


Millie reached out and gave the designer's arm a reassuring pat.


"I'll take care of it," she remarked.


The finals would be her chance to finally remove the mask. After that, there would be no room for doubt.


Once the costume was settled, Millie took a brief rest before heading to the afternoon rehearsal for Heavenly Melody.


Since every broadcast aimed for top quality,all acts were required to rehearse. Back during the first rehearsal, Millie had been stuck in bed and couldn't make it.



Charles later covered for her by altering the dates on her hospital records, making it seem like she got seriously injured ten days earlier, which made Vivian start suspecting Serena had ties to Charles.


During earlier rehearsals, everyone kept to themselves, focusing on their own staging. This time,though,things felt different.


While Millie waited backstage, one of the contestants -Daphne Wendell-showed up.


Without warning, Daphne perched on Millie's makeup table, looking down with a cold expression.


"Serena, I never thought you'd actually show your.face here again." Daphne sneered.


Wearing just a simple mask, Millie shot Daphne a quick glance.



"And why wouldn't l?" she answered.


Daphne let out a loud, mocking laugh. "Have you missed what's happening online? Have you not seen all the things they're saying about you?"


"What are people saying?" Millie asked, genuinely  interested in Daphne's motives.


After several rounds of calm live broadcasts, it seemed Daphne had been waiting for the finals to stir up trouble.


Instead of answering, Daphne simply handed Millie her tablet, the screen open to a page full of trending posts.



One glance told Millie everything-negative hashtags were everywhere: #SerenaOutOfTheMusicScene,#SerenaOutOfTheCompetition #BoycottSerena,and #SerenaOrHeavenlyMelody.


She barely glanced at the posts before turning back to her equipment.


"Did you see all that?" Daphne asked, wearing a sly smile.



"I saw," Millie replied, her tone even and steady.


"If I were you, l'd quit the competition," Daphne sneered. "So you wouldn't pull down the rest of the team with you."
Millie's hands stilled as she studied Daphne's expression.



"So you're saying you're only warning me for the sake of the production team?" Millie asked, arching a brow.



"That's right," Daphne replied with total confidence.


A quiet laugh escaped Millie.



"What a noble excuse!" she said, easily seeing through the act.



Everyone competing had an agency backing them.



News that the show wouldn't be cut off had reached every agency, and Daphne knew it as well as anyone.And it only made her claim almost laughable.



Daphne had come in second during the last round.If Serena bowed out, with the small gap in votes,Daphne stood the best chance at winning.


The semifinals had already picked the top three.

Even though the finals brought back former contestants for performances, the spotlight stayed fixed on the final trio.


Taking Serena out left just a fifty-fifty shot between the other two.


"We're all in the same business--let's just be honest here," Millie said plainly.


Daphne fell silent, glancing automatically at the seats out front.



Millie followed her eyes and spotted Myron,coordinating with the staff from his place in the audience.
###Chapter 132 Did The Divorce Go

Through





The Elliott Group came on board as a sponsor before the fourth live show, and Millie remembered Charles mentioning their plans to get involved with the champion's future development as well.


For that reason, it made perfect sense for them to be present, checking on advertisements and other business matters.



Even so, Millie's thoughts kept drifting back to her conversation with Myron earlier that mnorning.


She glanced over her shoulder at Daphne, who had already turned away.


"Is this because of the Elliott Group?" Millie asked.


A flash of annoyance crossed Daphne's face when she realized Millie had figured it out, but she didn't bother hiding the truth.
"Can you really say you're not interested in working with the Elliott Group?" Daphne asked. "They run the jewelry and luxury business, which is great for our image. Usually, someone else from their team comes out, but this time Mr. Elliott himself showed up. That means they're taking this seriously!"


"Plus," Daphne added, giving Millie a curious look,"you must know, even though the Elliott Group is just one of Crobert's big three, there's something mysterious about them. Actually, there's more to-wait, why am I even telling you all this?"


Millie just smiled and kept her thoughts to herself.


She actually knew more than Daphne was letting on.


Not only the Elliott Group, but the Watson Group and Evans Group all had their own secrets.


That was how those families had managed to hold their ground in Crobert,


"No, I'm not planning to back out," Millie replied,seeing that everything that had happened recently was bound to make Daphne rethink her approach.


"For the finals, we'll just have to rely on our own talent," Millie remarked.



"You!" Daphne snapped, reaching out as if she wanted to pull Millie's mask away and see who she really was.



Millie caught on right away and moved Daphne's hand aside.



"You're crossing the line," Millie retorted.


Daphne pressed her lips together in frustration,giving Millie a hard stare.


"I'm not nearly as bad as you," Daphne responded sharply. "Everyone knows you've got Charles backing you. The whole industry has heard that you're his woman!"



Millie stared at Daphne. There was a time when she'd found Daphne genuinely likable, but now she saw how wrong she'd been.

If people weren't fighting for their own interests,maybe things could stay friendly.


Whenever disputes arose, so did hidden grudges.


"My connection with Charles is strictly business,"Millie explained in a steady voice, and whether or not Daphne chose to believe her wasn't her problem.


Daphne only gave her a mocking sneer, clearly refusing to accept it.


"I earned my spot based on what I bring to the stage," Millie remarked, unwilling to let Daphne's.doubt go unanswered.


"No matter how much you try to defend yourself, it doesn't matter." Daphne sneered. "Serena, you'll never escape the rumors about donation fraud and sleeping your way to the top. Your name's already in the mud. You might keep Charles in your corner,but the Elliott family and the public are sharper than you think. The Elliott Group is only here now because of the show's promise and the contestants' real skill.Tricks won't keep working for you. I'll make sure I'm the one who gets the Elliott family's support!"


Millie's eyes softened with pity as she looked at Daphne.


It was true that Daphne's talent made her a strong competitor, but she failed to see the bigger picture.


A staff member called out, "Serena, it's time for rehearsal."


Gathering her things, Millie spared Daphne one last glance.


"You remember how I was sabotaged in both earlier rounds. Do you call that getting ahead by cheating?"With that, Millie walked onto the stage for rehearsal.


Some people simply couldn't be reasoned with.


If Daphne refused to change her mind, continuing the argument would be a waste of time.


Vivian was also present, of course.

This time, however, she kept her distance and didn't give Millie any trouble, which struck<Millie as strange.
Instead, Vivian shot her a quick, smug look filled with disdain before disappearing backstage.


Once backstage, Vivian spotted Daphne sulking in the corner.


She had no interest in Daphne's mood.


Normally, a few sharp comments about Serena would have slipped out, but after the recent blackmail scare, she kept quiet.


She couldn't be sure if anyone was secretly recording.



Even if Serena stayed in the competition, what did it matter?



Whatever name Serena once had was already in shambles.



As soon as Serena set foot on stage, Vivian planned to unleash a wave of online hate.



How could someone like her even think of standing up to Vivian?
In the past, Vivian had gone easy on Serena,hoping they could work together against Millie.



Did Serena honestly believe her luck would hold out forever?




···



Every minute of the day seemed filled.



Millie kept herself busy, hardly able to catch her breath.



There was so much to handle, she barely kept up.



In just a few days, taking off her mask would bring her face to face with Brandon and Vivian.



Myron's warnings echoed in her head.



No matter how many times she went over her plans,nothing ever felt certain.



Few people understood the Watson Group's strength as welI as Millie did.


After the rehearsal ended, she didn't seek Myron out.
On her way out, though, she noticed his eyes following her.


With the Elliott Group acting as a sponsor, Millie gave a brief nod out of politeness before making her way out.



She managed a greeting that was just the right balance between formal and friendly.



No one around her would ever guess that just hours earlier, Myron had surprised her with a proposal.


A silent smile played on Myron's lips.



She kept her distance, but that didn't bother him.


Patience was his strong suit; he could wait as long as it took.


All around him, staff and contestants gathered after rehearsal, eager to say hello. Myron greeted everyone in a composed, even tone.


Both Vivian and Daphne came over to greet him as well, but Myron treated them just the same. By the time he glanced up again, Millie had already disappeared around the corner.


She could feel Myron's gaze, but she had no intention of staying any longer.


After turning him down that morning, Millie saw no point in sending mixed signals.


Millie came to the quiet realization that she had been far too tense lately and needed to give herself a chance to loosen up.


Now that the divorce drama was over, she deserved to relax a little.



That thought made her reach for her phone, where she found a message from Charles in their group chat about where to meet tonight.


Charles remarked, "You're officially single again!Time to celebrate! Let's meet at Blue Lounge, book a private room, have some drinks and a good chat,and then dance and let loose for a while."


Alexia interjected, "I'm all for it! I've been dying to go.
They say the guys there are gorgeous, but Giffard never lets me!"



Giffard's reply came fast."Alexia!"



Alexia didn't let up. "Giffard, come on, I'm not going alone. We're going as a group, and I never said I'd flirt with anyone-just making an observation."


Seville chimed in as well, "I'm in! I want to go too!"


Finally, Charles turned the spotlight on Millie."What do you say, Millie? You're the guest of honor tonight,after all."



It didn't take Millie long to decide. Blue Lounge worked for everyone, and since the whole group was in their twenties, there was no need to worry about anyone being underage.


She replied to the group, "Sounds good! I'll see you all at Blue Lounge tonight!"


Over on the other side of town, Brandon's phone buzzed.
After a long day on his feet, Brandon glanced at his phone and spotted a message from Darden,saying,"Hey man, did the divorce go through? Feel like grabbing a drink at Blue Lounge?"
###Chapter 133 They Are Both Living Wildly
Brandon suddenly remembered his promise to Vivian -they were supposed to have dinner together tonight. So he responded, "I'll be a bit late. I'm having dinner with Vivian."


Darden replied immediately, "Alright, alright, your Vivian comes first. Anyway, I'll book a private room at the Blue Lounge and wait for you. Let's celebrate your first day of freedom!"



"Okay," Brandon said simply.


But after ending the call, another thought crept into his mind.



What was Millie doing on their first day apart?



He checked the time.


By now, she'd likely picked up Ari from school. She'd take her back to her apartment and cook dinner.



What would they be eating?


The beef stew Ari like?


The thought brought a small smile to his lips.


Without realizing it, Brandon pressed the intercom.

Moments later, Eugene entered the room.


"Mr. Watson," he greeted politely.


Brandon tapped his fingers on the desk. "Check the partnership terms with Magic Cartoon and order.some of their merchandise. For research."


Eugene opened his mouth to ask a question, but reconsidered and simply said, "UJnderstood."


"Once we've reviewed the items, send them to Ari's kindergarten," Brandon added. "Is that clear?"


"Yes, Mr. Watson. Distributing them to all the children will be the best approach."


Brandon gave a faint nod.
Ari wouldn't accept gifts from him directly. This was the only way he could give her something.


Still a bit dazed, Brandon thought back to how quickly the marriage had unraveled.


He had expected Millie to cry, to resist the divorce,maybe even refuse to sign the papers at first. But none of that happened.


He scrolled through their chat history. The last messages were still his-left on read, unanswered.


He recalled what he'd asked her last night-"Do you love me?" And she had given a positive answer.


So was she simply being mature, or was she just being stubborn,pretending she didn't care?







Meanwhile, Millie had already picked up Ari and brought her home.


They were having dinner together.


While Vivian arrived to meet Brandon at the restaurant, Millie was bathing Ari.


As Brandon and Vivian sat down for their meal, Millie finished getting Ari ready, buckled her into the car seat,and drove her to the children's home


Then, she returned home, parked the car, and took a taxi to the Blue Lounge. She might be drinking tonight, and it wasn't safe to drive.


Because she had Ari to look after, Millie arrived a little late.



When she opened the door to the private room, she was greeted by the sight of Alexia singing and dancing wildly, startling her.


Near her, Giffard stood with a deep frown, clearly at his wit's end.


"Millie, you're finally here!" Alexia said, stopping mid-song and beaming as she walked over. She grabbed a few handsome strangers and pushed them toward Millie.


"Here you go. Your order of eye candy has arrived!"
she said with a mischievous grin.


Millie blinked,completely confused.


Charles, standing nearby, was equally dumbfounded.


"Alexia..." Millie tried to speak, but Alexia pinched her arm and leaned in.



"I thought Giffard wouldn't show up. He was supposed to be on night duty. But he switched shifts at the last minute. Please, help me out, or I'm dead meat!"



"Alexia!" Giffard snapped, "You're whisperinginto a microphone. Do you think I'm deaf?"①


"I'm doomed, Millie!" Alexia wailed theatrically."This is the end!"



Millie couldn't help but laugh.


What a character!



Giffard chased his sister around the room while Seville took over the microphone and got the crowd hyped up.

Sheridan couldn't make it tonight, so Seville offered his apologies on his behalf.


Meanwhile, Charles walked over to Millie and poured her a drink.



"So, how's your first day post-divorce?" he asked with a light smile.


Millie took the glass and downed it in one go."Absolutely fabulous," she said with a grin.



The group burst out laughing.



The handsome escorts ended up staying. They might as well help liven the atmosphere.


"I swear I won't do this again, Giffard! No more boys!" Alexia shouted as she ran.


"You'd better not!" he replied,still chasing her.


Just outside, Darden happened to pass by the room.


The door was slightly open, and the sounds of music and laughter spilled into the hallway.
"Sounds like they're having fun," Darden remarked to the people with him.


They nodded,amused.


Darden didn't think much of it. He led his group to the next room, glancing at his phone.


He was about to text Brandon to ask when he'd join them when a notification popped up-


#BrandonVivianCandlelightDinner.


He tapped it and then chuckled. "Well, that's romantic."




···


Inside the room, Millie had just closed the door and sank into the sofa with a deep sigh.


"Feels good to unwind for once," she said, taking another sip of her drink.


For the moment, she had let go of all the weight she carried. It was a rare night to simply breathe and unwind.

Charles smiled and sat beside her. "I thought so too.But this is just the beginning. Once the Heavenly Melody finals are over, we should take Ari out for a real celebration."



Millie nodded in agreement. But that would have to wait until after Ari's surgery and recovery.


Tonight, she didn't want to think about any of that.Tonight was just for her.


"Let's dance," she said.


Charles smiled. "Let's go."


They headed down to the dance floor.


The space was packed. The crowd moved together,the dim lights pulsing in time with the music.


Surrounding the floor were booths, and in one of them, someone suddenly spit out his drink in shock.


"What's wrong with you?!" someone beside him asked,annoyed.


"Look! Isn't that Millie? Brandon's wife?" the man said, pointing toward the dance floor.


People turned.



Sure enough, there she was-laughing, dancing,completely at ease.


"Well, they're both living wildly!" someone muttered.


"Brandon's having a candlelit dinner with Vivian,and Millie's here partying! Isn't that Charles with her?"



"Looks like it."



Whispers spread like wildfire.


At that moment, Brandon's car pulled up in front of Vivian's apartment building.


He was just planning to drop her. off and then head over to meet Darden.



But Vivian didn't get out right away.


"Brandon," she said softly.


He looked at her.
"Would you like to come in for a bit?" she asked,cheeks flushed. "You're free now... so maybe we could..."

###Chapter 134 Why Was She Here





Brandon understood exactly what Vivian meant. But right now, he simply wasn't in the mood.



He had just gone through a divorce. Romance,let alone sex, was the last thing on his mind.


At the moment, all he wanted was some peace and quiet. He didn't want to think about anything else.


As that thought settled, he found himself relieved that he had agreed to meet Darden at the Blue Lounge, which now gave him the perfect excuse.



"I promised Darden I'd stop by," he said finally."You're not feeling well anyway. You should head up and rest."



Vivian looked at him, lips pressed into a thin line."Brandon, are you really not just making excuses? Or is it that... you still have feelings for Millie?"
Her voice wavered as her eyes began to well with tears. "If you don't want me, just say so. Go back to her, then. I think she'd still take you."


Brandon exhaled slowly, running a hand gently through her hair. "Vivian, I'm already divorced. That was my decision. I didn't hesitate."


She looked away, her expression wounded. Brandon reached for his phone and showed her the earlier message from Darden.



"See? I'm not making excuses. Just give me some time, alright?" he said quietly. "I need space to clear my head."



Vivian glanced at the message and then down at her hands, visibly guilty.



"I'm sorry," she murmured. "I thought..."


"It's okay. Just go get some rest." Brandon gave her hand a reassuring squeeze.


Vivian hesitated, but then gave a small nod.
She opened the door and stepped out of the car.Turning back, she looked at him, her eyes red. "P'll wait for you," she said sincerely. "Until I can't anymore."


Brandon didn't reply right away. He just nodded and said, "Good night."


Vivian turned and walked into the building.


Brandon waited until she disappeared inside, and then shifted the car into reverse and pulled away from the curb.


Two seconds later, the entrance door swung open again.Vivian reappeared.


Gone was the fragile, teary-eyed expression from before. She stared after Brandon's taillights, her gaze sharp with resentment.


She had seen the hesitation in his eyes.


He still wasn't over Millie.


She bit her lip, seething. She had to find a way to truly become Brandon's woman and bear his child.Otherwise, everything would start to unravel.







Meanwhile, at the Blue Lounge, Millie and Charles were still on the dance floor while Darden waited upstairs in a private room, bored out of his mind.


He pulled out his phone and opened Alyssa's chat.


Ever since she called himn a "useless bastard who only knew how to sleep around" and broke up with him, she'd thrown herself into her new career-appraising secondhand luxury goods.


Darden had stopped by her shop a few times, only to learn she'd already quit. Now she was working sales in a different boutique.


He found the change strange. Had she failed to meet her quotas? WVas that why she quit?


He had once bankrolled her entire lifestyle,convinced she'd come crawling back once reality hit.But she hadn't. Surprisingly, she was still holding out.
Lately, he had to admit-he missed her a bit. That fiery temper of hers was oddly endearing.



Thinking of her, he sent a message. "What have you been up to lately? Need any help with business?Want me to throw some clients your way?"


It didn't take long for her to reply. "Fuck off,you jerk!"



She also sent a fierce emoji.


Darden snorted, amused.


"Still got that bite," he muttered to himself.


But he loved it.



He needed to make time to see her.



He tucked the phone away, leaned on the armrest,and took another sip of his drink while watching the dance floor below.



Just as he was sipping his drink, his eyes widened in disbelief.
He blinked, and then squinted to confirm.


Was that...Millie?


His expression darkened. If Brandon saw this...


He quickly put down his glass and rushed out.


But just as he stepped into the hallway, the door to the neighboring private room opened.


Alexia stepped out, smiling. "Seville, while Giffard's in the bathroom, I'm heading downstairs to join Millie.

Want to come-"



She stopped mid-sentence.


"You?" she and Darden said in unison.



Without a word, Darden strode past her and peeked into the room she just came out from.



Inside, the male escorts were dancing awkwardly alongside a rotund man in flashy clothing.


Darden's expression turned stormy.


So this was what Millie and Alexia were up to.
Drinking,partying, and surrounding themselves with escorts?



If Brandon found out...


"What do you think you're doing?" Alexia snapped,trying to shut the door.


Darden blocked it. "Did you bring Millie here? You're having too much fun,missy!"


Alexia shot back, "What's wrong with it? If you're allowed to be here, why can't we be?"



She and Darden had known each other since childhood. They weren't close, but they'd crossed paths enough over the years.



Alexia had heard enough about Brandon and Darden's regular nights out to resent them both.


And Brandon often mentioned how Alexia and Millie were always scheming together.


So this meeting was like a spark to dry tinder. It was like enemies reuniting.
"We come here to drink and blow off steam. You think this is the same?" Darden growled.


"It's exactly the same!" Alexia fired back. "We're free women. What's wrong with dancing and a little eye candy?"


"You want to come, fine. But don't drag Mille into it,"he snapped, trying to push past her.



"Don't you dare!" she said, grabbing his arm. "Leave Millie alone!"


"Alexia!" Darden barked. The two of them were now fully arguing in the hallway.



···


Meanwhile, Brandon had parked in the lounge's underground garage.


He sat for a moment, staring at the street through the windshield.


The day had drained him more than he expected.


When he checked his phone, it was already past Just three more hours, and the day would finally be over.


He got out of the car and made his way inside the club.


The heavy music hit him instantly.


The crowd danced without inhibition as lights flashed rhythmically.


He moved past the dance floor toward the stairs. But just as his eyes swept over the crowd, something stopped him cold.


A woman in the middle of the dance floor. She was laughing,her hair bouncing as she danced.


Brandon froze.Millie?


What was she doing here?


And on the dance floor...smiling like that?
###Chapter 135 Meddling In Ex-wife's Affairs
Millie twirled beneath the shifting lights, a genuine smile lighting her face as she moved with the music.


For once, she allowed herself to let go.


Most days, she was constantly occupied. For seven relentless years, her world had revolved around Brandon-managing Watson Group affairs, juggling Bennett family obligations, darting from city to city on business trips, or spending long evenings at the Moonlit Estate making sure the elders were comfortable. Whenever she found a spare moment,she busied herself perfecting herhome with Brandon or mastering some new skill she thought would help.


Evenings out with her friends like this, echoing their carefree youth, were a rarity now.


And coming to a place like the Blue Lounge? That was practically unheard of.


Tonight, as she sipped her drink and laughed with her friends, she realized she actually enjoyed herself -at least in small doses. The blaring music and crowded dance floor were tolerable for a night,but she had no desire to make it a habit.


As Millie lost herself in the rhythm, her thoughts began to drift.



A sharp hand suddenly clamped around her arm,jarring her back to the present. She stiffened and spun around,bracing herself.


Brandon stood in front of her, his jawclenched tight,fury etched into every line of his face.


Millie yanked her arm back, but Brandon clamped down and dragged her straight off the dance floor.


Charles had vanished to the bar to get them drinks,nowhere in sight to intervene.


Brandon steered Millie down a side hallway, his grip punishing.
"Brandon, what the hell are you doing?" she snapped, twisting against him until she finally wrenched herself free.



The Blue Lounge was shadowy and close, the corridor humming with bass and muffled voices.Brandon's face was tight with barely contained rage.



"Why are you here?" he demanded, his voice pitched low but simmering.



Millie cut him a look of pure dismissal and turned on her heel, intent on escaping, but he caught her wrist again. She jerked away, jaw clenched.


"Why does it even matter to you?" she retorted,eyes narrowed, putting deliberate distance between them."Don't you dare touch me."


He echoed her words with a bitter, mocking laugh."You're seriously asking why it matters to me? Millie,you seem to forget your place."


She met his sneer with icy composure. "My place?You mean as your ex-wife?"
Brandon's expression turned thunderous as he snapped,"You!"


She tilted her head, smile unfazed. "Oh, right-l nearly forgot. Did you and Vivian finally get married?bet she couldn't wait a second. If so, congrats on your big day."


His jaw tightened, rage choking off any reply.


A surge of people swept past, pushing them off-balance for a heartbeat.


Bathed in the hazy lounge light, Millie's grin grew all the more striking.


For a long moment, Brandon said nothing. At last,he muttered, "Seems you've grown sharper since we last crossed paths."


She let out a quiet laugh. "Maybe you just never bothered to see who I really am."


All these years, he'd only cared about control-never once trying to understand her dreams, her feelings,or the stubborn streak in her heart.
There was a time when she'd given Brandon her heart without hesitation, ready to share every sunrise and secret for the rest of their lives.



That devotion had vanished now-she'd reclaimed every ounce of love, leaving nothing left for him.


Whoever he was, whatever he felt, no longer mattered.


As Brandon stared at her, words failing him, a quiet disappointment flickered across Millie's face.


She didn't have the patience for him anymore.Spotting Charles weaving back through the crowd,two frosty beers in hand, she gave a quick wave and turned on her heel to meet him.


The sight of Millie moving toward Charles sent a fresh wave of fury through Brandon. He couldn't stand watching her laugh and dance with another man.


Without warning, he seized her wrist and yanked her toward the stairs leading up to the private room Darden had reserved.


Jealousy burned in his chest, each heartbeat more erratic than the last. He couldn't stomach the thought of her being so carefree in another man's company.



"Brandon, let go! Do you hear me?" Millie demanded,pounding her free hand against his arm. His hand only tightened around her wrist, his hold stubborn and unyielding as steel, making escape impossible.


"You're hurting me." Millie gripped the railing, teeth bared, and bit down on his hand. Even then,Brandon's hold didn't budge-his gaze only grew colder.


"Millie!" Charles' voice broke through the noise as he rushed over.


Seeing him, Brandon carried Millie over his shoulder and muscled his way upstairs, ignoring her fists pounding against his back.


The commotion outside the private room finally made Millie, seething, seized the moment to drive her heel into his leg.



Brandon jerked, pain flashing across his face,and his arms fell away.


She landed squarely on her feet, chest heaving.


Brandon's scowl deepened as he reached for her again, but in that instant, MAillie's sharp slap echoed through the air.


Her entire body shuddered, jaw clenched, knuckles white with tension.



She despised this helplessness-the way he could overpower her so easily, the way he used brute force to impose his will. Rage simmered beneath her skin.


"Brandon!"



"Millie!"



Alexia and Darden, alarmed by the confrontation,rushed over at once.
Brandon's left cheek reddened and began to swell,but his eyes only grew colder, a dark warning flickering in their depths.


"Brandon, if you ever touch me like that again, I'll call the police!" Millie exclaimed, her voice icy and unwavering, brooking no argument.


The heated exchange quickly drew a crowd as Seville and the escorts he'd been dancing with stepped out of the private room, their curious eyes fixed on the commotion.



"What's happening out here?" one of them asked,still trying to piece together the scene.


Brandon's glare swept over the group, his expression fierce and menacing. He looked like he wanted to tear someone apart.


"Who the fuck are these guys?" he demanded, jaw clenched so tightly his words almost cracked.


Alexia, arms folded and attitude dialed up, shot back."Isn't it obvious? They're the gorgeous guys from the club, actually enjoying themselves with us tonight.You got a problem with that?"



Brandon's scowl deepened, shadows darkening his face just as he drew a sharp breath to retort.


Right then, Charles barreled onto the scene, two beers still in hand.


Fueled by adrenaline and protectiveness, he didn't hesitate-he drove his foot straight into Brandon with a sharp kick.


"Charles!" Darden barked, stepping forward, clearly ready to break things up before it spiraled out of control.


Giffard reappeared from the hallway afterhis visit to the men's room, took in the tangled mess, and hurried forward to pry them apart.


Amid the tangled voices and flying hands,a sudden crash snapped the crowd into complete silence.


Heads whipped toward the noise.
Millie stood in the center, clutching a half-broken beer bottle, shards and froth exploding at her feet.


"That's enough." Her voice rang out, cool and resolute. She shot a calm look at Alexia, her tone softening. "Come on, Alexia. Let's go back."


Sliding her fingers around Alexia's, Millie guided her out of the haze, leading the way toward the private room.


Darden started to speak, but Alexia jumped in,her tone dripping with mockery. "Seriously? Is there anything more shameless than an ex-husband meddling in his ex-wife's life after the divorce?"


"You!"



Brandon tried to fire back, but Alexia didn't give him the chance. "What the hell do you want to say now?Or are you finally embarrassed? Maybe you shouldn't have played around if you can't take the consequences."


Alexia's quick, biting comebacks left no room for rebuttal. "Let's be real, Brandon. You're the one at fault here. Drop the victim act-it's pathetic."


Seville was already hustling the guys back into the private room, while Charles slipped some cash to the cleaning staff and, together with Giffard, steered Alexia and Millie away.


With a resounding bang, they slammed the door right in Brandon's face.


Darden reached for the handle, but the door refused to budge.


Left standing in the dim hallway, Brandon's face had gone ghostly pale. His fists shook at his sides, and the bite mark Millie had left was still seeping blood, a stark reminder under the flickering light.
###Chapter 136 One Is Happy, The Other Is Furious
Music pulsed through the room as Seville and the others danced, but Brandon stood still outside,unmoving.


His eyes were bloodshot, fixed on the tightly closed door of the private room across the hall.


Nearby, a cleaner was mopping the floor, humming to,herself, pleased with the generous tip she'd received from Charles to just sweep up the broken glass.


"Excuse me, could you lift your feet?" she asked politely,looking up at Brandon.


Darden, noticing Brandon's increasingly tense expression, tried to steer him away. "Our room's just next door. I doubt they'll be coming out anytime soon. Let's wait in there."


Brandon finally tore his gaze from the door and  followed Darden into the neighboring suite.


As they left, the cleaner finished her task, still humming as she patted the pocket where the tip rested and exited the hallway.


Inside Millie's private room, the atmosphere was completely different.


Alexia, still fuming, pulled out her phone and brought up the gossip showing Brandon and Vivian having a candlelit dinner.


She held the screen up and snapped, "Unbelievable.Does Brandon seriously think he can just be with Vivian now and then crawl back to Millie later? He wants to have it all. How disgusting!"


The others voiced their support, exchanging looks of disapproval and making faces at the screen.


Millie, despite everything, felt a quiet sense of warmth.



Painful as her past had been, she was thankful to be surrounded by people who genuinely cared for her.
And for now, that was enough.


"Forget them. We're here to celebrate tonight, so let's enjoy ourselves," she said, raising her glass.


The atmosphere lightened, and the handsome escorts hired for the party did their part to liven things up. Laughter and music filled the room.


But while Millie's room was buzzing, the mood in Brandon's was somber.


He drank one glass after another, not sipping-chugging.


Darden sighed and reached for the bottle, sliding it out of Brandon's reach. "Take it easy, man."


Brandon frowned, noticing his drink had disappeared, and reached to grab it, but Darden held it back.



Brandon was frustrated, but Darden understood. If Alyssa were next door dancing and drinking with a bunch of guys, he wouldn't be calm either.
Unable to retrieve his drink, Brandon slumped back on the sofa, eyes on the ceiling as the colored lights from above flickered and spun.


Darden pulled out his phone and opened the same article Alexia had shown Millie.


"You know, I get why she's angry. You had a candlelit dinner with Vivian. It's no wonder she's upset. That's probably why she's out there partying. Don't worry,though. Charles and Giffard are there. Nothing wil happen to her."


Darden tried to reassure his friend. But Brandon'didn't react.


Whether it was the alcohol, the sleepless nights, or both, his head spun, and his thoughts were muddy.


It didn't matter to him that Millie was mad at him about Vivian.


Right now, all he wanted was to see her walk out of that room.


But the music next door was still blaring, and through the wall, he could even hear Alexia's off-key singing and Millie's laughter. It only made him feel worse.






Meanwhile, someone had tipped off the paparazzi after spotting Millie at the Blue Lounge.


They waited, and soon enough, the scene outside the private rooms gave them what they wanted.


They couldn't get close, but from a distance, they captured photographs of the argument.


The photos and gossip spread quickly online,even overtaking the latest buzz about Serena.#MillieAtBlueLounge,#MillieAndBrandonBothFoolingAround,#BrandonDiningWithVivianWhileMilliePartiesAtBlueLo unge.



···


The Internet was ablaze.


"Whoa, looks like Millie's done playing the quiet wife!"


"This drama's better than TV. Keep it coming!"


"Can't wait for the next twist!"


"Don't care who's right-I just want the show!"


"Honestly, none of them seem great, but at least Vivian stands for something."



···


Vivian stared at her screen, fuming. The cup in her hand slammed onto the table.


She should've gone to the Blue Lounge with Brandon. Millie had probably been waiting, keeping tabs through Darden.


That conniving woman!


Vivian had thought Millie had given up, but no. She was lying low, planning her comeback.


Vivian's hands trembled with anger.


She reached for her phone to make a call but  stopped herself. Instead, she pulled out a second phone and made a call using a different line.


The call connected.


"What is it?" a voice answered.


"The information I asked for earlier-what's the update? Did the person survive?" Vivian asked,deliberately lowering her voice to a hoarse rasp.


"You mean the person got hit outside the city?" The sound of typing followed. "Hang on."


A few moments passed. "He survived. Barely. The'prognosis isn't good. He's in a vegetative state.Might wake up, but chances are slim."


"Understood," she said, and ended the call.


She turned the phone off and let out a long breath,finally relaxing.



···


At the Elliott Mansion, Myron sat with a kitten curled beside him, skimming through a stack of reports.

Across the room, Jayceon was raging over a losing streak.


"Ugh! Lost again! Trash game, useless teammates!"he yelled, tossing the console aside and grabbing his phone to scroll through video reels. But a few clips in, he suddenly sat upright, coughing. "Gosh!Myron!"


He hurried over, holding out his phone.


"Look at this! Millie's really out there tonight! I bet Brandon's losing his mind!"


But then he paused, remembering something."Right... Sorry. I forgot about the whole failed proposal this morning."


Myron glanced at the screen, adjusted his glasses,and let out a soft chuckle.


"You're not mad?" Jayceon asked, peeking at his brother.


"She's newly divorced. She deserves to celebrate,"Myron replied calmly, eyes returning to the papers in  front of him.


Jayceon gave a small nod and went back to his videos.


He admired Millie more than ever. Smart, beautiful,capable-enough to capture even his brother's full attention.


Myron, unfazed by Jayceon's antics, reached down and stroked the kitten's head as it stretched and let out a tiny meow.






Back at the Blue Lounge, Millie, Alexia, and the others were starting to wind down for the night.
###Chapter 137 Vulnerable





When Millie's group were about to leave, the area outside the Blue Lounge was packed wall to wall.


Everyone seemed eager to snap a photo.


Millie and the others were being jostled by the crowd.


At the same time, Brandon had just stepped out from the club.



A sea of people separated them.


"This is insane. Where did all these people come from?" Charles said, pulling out his phone, ready to call for help.


But before he could, a security team rushed in,quickly forming a barrier between Millie's group and the swarming paparazzi.


Charles looked confused. He hadn't even made the call yet.
The team leader approached their group.


"Miss Bennett, Mr. Evans, we were sent by Mr. Elliott to escort you home," he said with a slight bow before turning to Alexia and the others. "You're all covered."


Charles narrowed his eyes. "Which Mr.Elliott?"


"Mr. Myron Elliott," the man replied."As a partner of Evans Entertainment, he heard about your situation and offered his support."


Realization dawned. Charles nodded. "Please extend my thanks to him." Then he turned to Millie. "Let's go."


The team leader gave Millie a polite smile. She returned a brief glance, said nothing,and followed Charles to the waiting car.


Just as she was about to get in, a voice rang out from the crowd-"Millie!"



It was Darden.



She looked over and spotted him, his expression tense.


Next to him, Bradon stood silent, his gaze locked on her,intense and uhreadable.


Millie lowered her eyes, turned away, and stepped into the car.


There was nothing more to say.


If they were to meet again, it would be when she walked into Watson Group with the agreement they had signed to reclaim what belonged to her.


As the car door shut and the engine started,Brandon's line of sight was finally broken.


The paparazzi, realizing they had missed Millie and Charles,swarmed around Brandon instead.



"Mr. Watson, are things tense between you and Millie?"


"There are rumors you're both involved in affairs. Any truth to that?"


"Mr. Watson, what's the current state of your marriage?"


"Mr.Watson-"


Darden was already dialing frantically, trying to get them out of there while microphones crowded in on Brandon.


But Brandon didn't move. He wvas still staring in the direction of the car that had just turned the corner.


"Come on, we're getting crushed!" Darden shouted into the phone, and then turned to Brandon."Brandon, let's just-Brandon!"


He tried to pull him back into the club while they waited for backup, but Brandon stumbled, nearly collapsing.


Darden caught him and placed a hand on his forehead. "You're burning up!"


Still, Brandon didn't respond. He just stood there,watching the street where Millie had disappeared.
Inside the car, the interior had been thoughtfully stocked-hangover medicine, bottled water, snacks,and even spare clothes in case anyone felt ill and threw up.


In the back seat, Alexia opened a snack and glanced at Charles. "Your business partner's pretty impressive. As soon as he found out we were stuck,he sent a rescue team and even stocked the car.Everything's ready."


Charles looked puzzled too. Was he really that close with Myron? "I'm actually lost here. Myron's always been mysterious. He wasn't even based in.the country until a couple of years ago. I don't know.Maybe he just wants to support the follow-up promotion for Heavenly Melody."


Millie said nothing.


She had already turned Myron down once. But since the Elliott Group was helping now as a business partner-not for personal reasons-she had no grounds to refuse.
As the ride continued smoothly, Alexia scrolled through her phone. A news alert popped up: Brandon had been taken away by an ambulance.


After a moment's thought, she handed the phone to Millie. She would find out eventually anyway.


"That's what he gets," Charles muttered.


Millie simply looked at the screen and nodded. No further comment.



That was all.







Later that night, Brandon woke up in a haze.His vision was blurred, his body weak.


Someone was gently wiping his arm.


He reached out and grabbed the hand.


"Millie," he rasped.


"You've mistaken me, Mr. Watson," the caregiver said softly,withdrawing her hand. "I'm not your wife."

His vision gradually cleared. It was indeed a caregiver standing beside him.


He turned his head. The sterile ceiling and the IV drip confirmed where he was.



"Brandon!" Babette's voice rang out as she entered the room. "Millie is unbelievable. You're in the hospital, and she's out having fun? She's nowhere to be seen. It was Darden who brought you in. Your phone's been right here, and I checked-she hasn't even called once!"


Brandon felt drained. He didn't have the strength to argue.


He picked up his phone. Messages from his grandparents, work partners, and even Vivian-everyone had checked in. Except Millie.


Whether it was the fever or something else, a hollow ache settled in his chest.


Babette was still going on and on. "She's so heartless. I just can't believe-"
Brandon's head throbbed.


He set the phone aside and closed his eyes again.


He thought back to a time when he had fallen ill,just like now. Millie had been by his side the entire night,running around to care for him.


When he woke up in the morning, she had been slumped over at his bedside.


Startled by the sound, she had looked up, eyes filled with concern.


"You're awake," she had said, touching his forehead."Thank goodness, the fever's gone. I was so worried."



But now, a stranger sat where she once had.


The contrast struck him with such force it became hard to breathe.


Babette's voice kept droning on and on. Brandon barely heard anything now.


"Enough," Brandon interrupted, voice hoarse. "Go home,Babette. I'll be fine tomorrow."


Babette wanted to protest but held back, seeing the state he was in.


"Alright. I'll come by again tomorrow," she said before giving a few instructions to the caregiver, and then left.


And in the quiet, all Brandon could see were the fragments of his life with Millie-meeting her when they were young, falling for her, the days they had shared, and the moment she shut the car door today without looking back.


It seemed that illness made people vulnerable and sentimental.


And tonight, Brandon was drowned in memory.
###Chapter 138 My Cat Can Do A Backflip
The night stretched on, thick with unspoken tensions.


Back at her apartment, Millie rinsed off the day's exhaustion and slipped into a loose nightgown. She drifted onto the balcony, letting the mild May air cool her damp skin and tangle gently through her hair.


Her phone screen lit up, snapping her out of her reverie. A new message flashed on the display. "This is Myron Elliott and here's my number. Please save it."


The wording was so stiff, so formal, she could practically see him hunched over his desk, pecking at each word like he was composing an official memo.


Still, this wasn't the message she'd been waiting for -not tonight.


A few quiet minutes slipped by before her phone buzzed again.


Babette's name appeared on the caller ID.


Millie hesitated, thumb hovering, before finally picking up.


"What's going on?" she asked, her voice soft but wary.


Babette's voice crackled with anger. "Millie,Brandon's in the hospital-he's sick and all alone.Don't you even care enough to visit?"


A faint crease formed between Millie's brows. "Didn't he mention anything to you?"


Babette's irritation flared. "Mention what? Stop dodging."


Millie hesitated, Derek's face briefly flickering through her mind.


"It's nothing," she said, her voice flat.
Brandon probably just needed time before breaking the news of their divorce to the Watson family.


Derek had shown her nothing but kindness throughout that doomed marriage, so she'd leave it to Brandon to explain. But if he dragged it out, she certainly wouldn't cover for him.


"Millie,you..."


Millie cut in before Babette could get the words out,"I already know he's sick. That's enough. I have things to do."


Without waiting for a reply, she ended the call.


She wasn't about to sit and take the blame for someone else's mess.


Millie ignored the persistent ring of her phone and,with a swipe of her finger, blocked Babette's number,effectively muting her latest attempt to get through.


Settling back on the long chaise lounge, she let her gaze wander across the glittering city skyline, where windows burned with a thousand stories and the traffic below hummed on, undaunted by the late hour.


No matter how deep into the night it was,this city never truly slept-its lights blazed, restless as her own thoughts.


Finally, the phone shuddered in her hand again.


This time the caller ID flashed Derek's name.


Millie drew in a steadying breath, squared her shoulders, and answered with a warmth she hoped sounded effortless.


"Derek." She greeted him softly.


"Millie," he responded with a heaviness she could feel even through the line.


Derek's voice was rough with fatigue, the exhaustion in it unmistakable. For a long moment, he just breathed-then, with a weary sigh, he finally asked,"What's really going on between you and Brandon?"


Millie hesitated, at a loss for words.
Derek's voice, sharp with anger, broke the silence."know you're furious about Brandon and Vivian!" He practically spat Vivian's name. "Norma's already decided she'll handle Vivian herself!"


An older woman's voice cut in from nearby--firm,unmistakably Norma. "Millie, we gave that fool a chance to fix things on his own, but it's clear he's hopeless! I'll have a word with Vivian myself!"


A knot of emotion twisted in Millie's chest-part gratitude, part resignation.


But her marriage to Brandon was over, and she had no plans to turn back.


Whatever happened between Brandon and Vivian had nothing to do with her anymore, so Norma really didn't have to get involved.


She let out a steady breath. "There's really no need.""Millie..."


"Brandon still has things he hasn't told you," Millie remarked gently, her tone measured. "There are Derek went quiet for a beat, nis voice returning, low and searching. "Millie, is there something going on between the two of you?"

Millie lifted her eyes to the scattered city lights,weighing her words. "It's nothing major-just something he should explain to you himself."

Once, Brandon had led her to Derek's bedside during a health crisis; now, she felt it was only right for Brandon to face Derek on his own.

She let out a faint sigh. "I'm a little tired tonight. I think I'll turn in."

Cutting off any chance for more questions,Millie said a quick goodnight and ended the call.
Millie unlocked her phone and found a video of a cat doing an energetic backflip.


Following that, a message read, "My cat can do a backflip."


MAillie let out a soft chuckle. "Childish," she muttered,tossed her phone onto the nightstand and then settled into bed, ready for sleep.


Meanwhile, at the Elliott Mansion, Jayceon sat on the carpet, coaxing Myron's ragdoll cat with treats.


"Show us your acrobatic moves, superstar!" he insisted eagerly. "Let's see it again-come on, just one more backflip!"


But the cat, thoroughly unimpressed, stretched languidly and sauntered off, leaping straight into Myron's waiting lap.


Myron's eyes softened as he scratched under the cat's chin, earning a deep, satisfied purr.

In the days that followed, a whirlwind of events shook up the online world.


The fallout between Millie and Brandon exploded across social media, their names plastered everywhere as the story went viral overnight.


By morning, a brand-new headline had already stolen the spotlight.


Vivian's latest series was suddenly everywhere-a show loosely inspired by "Glimmer of Love," though the title had been slyly tweaked to "Love of Vivian"for promotion purpose, swapping in her own name for maximum buzz.


The series spun a bittersweet tale: two strangers drawn together by fate, swept into a romance, only for tragedy to strike when one of them fell gravely ill and died.


The trailer set the Internet abuzz. In one poignant scene, the heroine recorded a demo in the studio,pouring her feelings into every note, while the male lead listened silently in the next room, completely captivated yet unable to confess his feelings.


Later, that very same demo echoed hauntingly as the female lead died in his arms, the music stirring up memories of their lost happiness and driving the heartbreak home.


Within hours, the trailer had gone viral. Viewers swarmed to comment sections, hungry for fresh gossip and already debating the love story's twists and emotional gut punches.


The buzz around Millie and Brandon had long faded into yesterday's news.


"I nearly cried just from the trailer. When the show drops, I'm definitely watching it first."


"This is Vivian and Brandon's love story, right? It's heartbreaking-Vivian dying in his arms with their song playing...I can't handle it."


"Hurry up and release it! I'm ready to binge as soon as it's out!"
As Millie scrolled through the comments, an amused smile tugged at her lips.


The sooner Vivian's new show aired, the sooner Millie could push her lawsuit forward.


She'd also heard whispers that Vivian was determined to get the show approved for a theatrical run, but that review process would drag on. Millie doubted Vivian could actually pull it off.


She was reading all this while seated in the Watson Group's conference room, her lawyer by her side.


Sliding the divorce agreement across the polished table to Eugene, she fixed him with a steady gaze and demanded that every asset be returned to her-including the old Bennett family business now under the Watson Group's control.


"Eugene, please do a full inventory. I want the handover wrapped up within two days. This is my attorney, Darrion Clark. Any problem, you can reach out to him directly." She gestured to the man standing tall beside her, his presence quietly authoritative.
###Chapter 139 We'll Go Through The Courts

Millie had seen this day coming since she'd slipped that unique clause into the agreement from the start.


She'd sat down with a lawyer well before moving on with her plan.


Brandon's name sat neatly at the bottom of the agreement they had signed. As long as nothing went awry, the approval could go straight through company channels.


Eugene studied his copy of the paperwork,worry flickering across his features.


There was no question of authenticity-Millie still had the original, and Brandon kept his version, giving,Eugene all the proof he needed.


"Mrs. Watson, this..." Eugene said, only to trail off as the staccato rhythm of high heels echoed closer.
Babette's voice cut through, full of curjosity "Eugene? Millie? What are you two doing here?"


With practiced ease, Eugene tucked the document out of sight.


After hosting her now-famous wine tasting, Babette had joined the Watson Group for good-not part of the finance team, but overseeing overseas business especially concerning Flesta and pitching in with her father's division.


She approached with purpose, a document clutched in her hand, and joined them without hesitation.


A sharp glance landed on Eugene as Babette asked,"What's all this about?"


Her attention snapped to Millie. "Brandon's in the hospital, you know. So what brings you here right now?"


Whether Brandon was ill or not made no difference to Millie's agenda.


Today was about settling property matters-a step she'd planned well in advance, complete with legal counsel ready to go.


Keeping things tidy and free from Babette's interference was Millie's goal; she just wanted the Bennett family's assets back, no drama attached.


A subtle gesture from Millie urged Eugene to move the conversation somewhere more private.


Babette blocked their exit, suspicion flashing in her eyes. "Where are you sneaking off to? Up to something behind closed doors?"


Without flinching, Millie replied, "There's nothing secret here. I'm separating what's mine from the Watson Group, that's all."


Babette asked further, her voice sharp, "You mean even that division?"


"Naturally." Millie's answer came cool and quick.


A laugh burst from Babette. "Are you out of your mind, Millie? That department's already absorbed by the Watson Group. There's no pulling it out now-it doesn't belong to you anymore!"


"Babette." Millie didn't hesitate. Taking a step forward, she leveled a cold gaze at Babette. "Asset division between Brandon and me isn't your concern."


A flush of anger crept up Babette's cheeks. "You-!"


Millie, unfazed, turned away and addressed Eugene,saying, "Let's pick up where we left off."


Refusing to give ground, Babette shot Eugene a look that dared him to say a word.


She brushed her own paperwork aside, pulled out her phone, and dialed Brandon. "Just wait, Millie.Brandon's not about to let you walk off with anything."


Millie's gaze flicked to thephone in Babette's hand,expression unreadable.


Eugene spoke up, a note of caution in his voice."Mrs. Watson, this has to go through Mr. Watson personally. Even with these papers, his approval is required."


A quick glance passed between Millie and Darrion,silent understanding flashing between them.


Both had expected Brandon would need to sign off before anything was finalized.


Even so, Millie would have preferred to wrap things up without any more detours.


With a calm resolve, she addressed Eugene, saying,"From now on, just call me Millie."


For a moment, Eugene wavered. In the end,he nodded and made compromise. "Yes, Miss Bennett."


Babette rolled her eyes with a huff. "What a hypocrite!" she grumbled under her breath.


Right then, Babette's call connected.


Brandon's voice filtered through, steady and cool."What's going on?"


Without wasting a second, Babette chimed in,"Brandon, Millie's here, trying to take the  department. She's in the office right now-are you aware of this?"


A heavy pause followed; Brandon said nothing at first.



Millie waited quietly, her eyes on Babette, listening as the call played out on speaker.


Seconds ticked by in thick silence. Babette grew impatient. "Brandon?"


At last, Brandon's answer came, firm and final."She's not getting it. Tell her that's from me."


With that, the line went dead.


A grin of victory spread across Babette's face."There you have it. Did you catch that?"


Millie gave Eugene a steady look. "Then we'll go through the courts."


Not a hint of rattle disturbed her poise; to her, this was just business as usual.


One brief nod to Darrion signaled the end of the meeting. Together, they turned and walked out


As the elevator doors slid shut, Babette's warning rang out behind them. "Millie, don't waste your timne!It's not gonna happen!"


Neither spoke as they rode the elevator to the lobby,silence hanging heavy until they walked out of the Watson Group building. Only then did Darrion break the silence. "Miss Bennett,we always knew this was a likely outcome. It's no surprise the Watson Group won't hand things over easily. We'll just move forward with the legal process. Given the evidence and documentation you've provided-your odds are strong, whether through settlement or purchase.Still, litigation will take longer than a direct division."


Cars drifted past on the busy street, their lights reflected in Millie's eyes as she watched.


She gave a quiet nod in agreement.


Legal proceedings had been part of her plan all along.
What caught her off guard was how Brandon had flatly refused, leaving no room for compromise.


She thought back to all those nights he'd promised her-swearing the Bennett family assets were only under Watson Group's care for the time being.He'd pledged to find answers about her father's death and help restore her family's name.


Now, he wouldn't even let her reclaim what was rightfully hers.


Promises from men, she realized, were often just fleeting words.


At least she'd never pinned much hope on him.


For Millie, today was just a box to be checked-one more step in a plan that was always hers alone.


"I'll be counting on your expertise from here on out,Mr. Clark," Millie remarked.


Darrion replied smoothly, "It's my responsibility. Still,Miss Bennett, you should brace yourself-this won't be settled overnight."
A nod from Millie showed her understanding.
Their conversation ended there, and Millie made herway back to her car.
As soon as she slid into the driver's seat, her phonevibrated with an incoming message. "| know a skilleddivorce attorney. He'll be in touch with you thisafternoon."
Almost immediately, another text arrived."Babette'slatest post made your situation clear to me. l'm hereto help-no hidden agenda,l promise."
The messages were signed by Myron
He'd even included a screenshot of Babette's socialfeed.
Babette's post read,"Running off with her tailbetween her legs."
Beneath her words,a photo captured Millie'sretreating figure as she stepped into the elevator.
Meanwhile, Brandon came across Babette's latest post as he scrolled through social media.


A frown creased his brow as he switched to her chat and fired off a message.


"Take it down. Don't air today's business in public,"he instructed.


Babette grumbled her complaints, but she ended up deleting the post anyway.


Turning to his messages with Millie, Brandon started typing, "That wasn't my idea-she posted on her own."



His thumb hovered over the send button. In the end,he left it unsent.



Would it even matter to Millie? She probably wouldn't believe him.


With a sigh, Brandon deleted the unsent message.


His fever was gone now, and a night's rest had started to bring him back to himself.
When Babette called earlier, his assistant had beer sorting out his hospital discharge papers.


Deep down, Brandon always knew the Bennett assets were rightfully Millie's.


Still, he couldn't bring himself to release his hold on them.



Logic settled back in.


He had already run through the possibilities: a court battle could last three months on a fast track, or half a year on a standard schedule-with plenty of time for both rounds of trial, easily covering the next five months.



Darden's words from the night before echoed in his mind-"Millie was furious."



Over these next five months, he would have to stay close to Vivian, but he couldn't let Millie slipaway.


Five months from now, Brandon planned to put the whole truth in front of Millie-no more secrets.
Days blurred together, and before long, the finals for Heavenly Melody were almost here.
###Chapter 140 The Day To Take Off The Mask
Four episodes have aired since Heavenly Melody debuted.


In the beginning, most of the buzz centered around Vivian since show didn't feature any top-ranking vocalists, and the oldest contestant was only twenty-five, clearly placing them in the fresh crop of rising talent.



But things shifted halfway through the season.Serena stole the spotlight, stunning viewers with her skill and artistry.


From the third episode on, once, the technical constraints on sound and video were resolved,her talent became undeniable.


Then came the fallout after episode four.


Rumors exploded online, accusations of donation fraud, inappropriate dealings for influence, and other scandals tied to Serena surfaced. Despite the uproar,she hadn't exited the competition, even as the finale approached.


The Internet erupted with backlash.


"What's happening? Why hasn't Serena been kicked out yet?"


"I'll give them until tomorrow morning. If she's still in,I'm dropping a one-star review."


"If someone like Serena can just keep climbing, then what's the point in anything?"


"Boycott Serena!"



...


The show's official account was overwhelmed with angry replies.


Their latest post was buried beneath a storm of protests and insults.


Evans Entertainment's page was caught in the fire as well. No one really knew Serena's background, so the public turned its fury toward the company behind her.



Even Daphne got pulled into the mess.


During one of the rehearsals, she uploaded a vlog.The video included a masked figure, but it was obvious to anyone watching,it was Serena.


Countless comments flooded in, all asking the same thing-was that Serena in the video, and had she finally dropped out?


At first, Daphne kept silent. But the noise grew too loud to ignore. Eventually, she responded. "Please stop asking me, or this post might disappear. The show isn't mine to decide. What you see is what it is."


That response carried layers of meaning, prompting a wave of speculation.


"Please stop asking me, or this post might disappear" suggested she'd been warned not to  attract too much attention or the post would be taken down.


"The show isn't mine to decide" hinted that Serena had powerful backing, most likely Evans Entertainment-the real decision-maker.



And "What you see is what it is" confirmed what everyone already suspected: the masked contestant in the rehearsal clip was Serena, and she wasn't backing down.


Some users were incredibly perceptive.


Daphne couldn't help but laugh as she read through the responses.


"You guys are unbelievable," she said, wiping away a tear from the corner of her eye from laughing too hard.


She looked at her tablet, where the newest documents from her agency were pulled up, outlining the business deals lined up after the Heavenly Melody finale.
Sponsorships were listed according to final rankings,and the rewards from Elliott Group stood out the most.



" have to win," Daphne murmured, tapping firmly on the screen. "If I can lock in Elliott Group, I'll never have to worry about anything ever again. Serena,what's the point in being so gifted? Even if you force your way to the top, the public's already turned on you. The backlash won't stop, it'll only grow stronger."






At that very moment, Millie stepped out of the Evans Entertainment training building.


As she walked toward the parking lot, a few soft honks sounded, followed by a quiet "meow."


She turned her head and spotted a man leaning casually against his car.


He wore a fitted black shirt, holding a bag in one hand. In the other, he cradled a ragdoll cat.
Since rumors about her and Charles had begun circulating, Millie had taken to wearing a mask and cap whenever she entered or left the practice rooms.Still, Myron always managed to recognize her.

He'd once offered to recommend a lawyer, but she had already hired Darrion and turned him down.


He insisted there were no strings attached, but Millie couldn't pretend she didn't understand the subtext.


With those thoughts drifting in the back of her mind,she approached him.


"Do you need something?" she asked, halting just in front of him.


"My last message,remember the video I sent you?
The one of my cat doing a backflip? You didn't reply,
"Meow," the cat chimed in, round eyes blinking up at her.


"Huh?" Millie blinked, taken off guard.


Unbothered, Myron went on, full of confidence. "You see-having a cat this skilled makes it hard not to brag. I've been itching to show off."


Millie stared at him, trying to make sense of what was happening.


Before she could respond, Myron crouched down,set the ragdoll cat gently on the ground, and offered it a small treat. He then gave its head a quick pat.


"Meow!" Then, astonishingly, the cat flipped backward in one clean motion.


Millie's lips parted slightly.


Did it really just do that? Right on cue?


It was... surprisingly smart.


The cat padded over to her, brushing against her leg and purring, its tail held high. It tilted its head and meowed again, clearly asking for attention.


"Looks like it has a thing for you,"	Myron said,smiling as he held out a small freeze-dried snack."You can feed it,if you want."


Millie looked from the cat to the treat in his hand.


After a short pause, she gave in. She crouched beside the cat and offered it the snack, her hand steady.


The cat purred happily while it ate, and Millie found herself smiling.


It really was cute.


"I got you a late-night snack." Myron lifted a thermos box from his bag just as she focused on the cat.


Millie glanced up at him. Every movement-unhurried, tidy, unforced-fit him.


She lowered her eyes again, gave the cat the last bit of the treat, and rose to her feet.


"I appreciate it, but I don't need it." Her tone stayed polite, but she kept her distance.


She gave a small nod and headed for her car.


"My offer still stands," Myron called after her. "I'd be honored if you ever decide to take me up on it. Use me, Millie, I won't mind."


Her hand stalled on the door handle for just a beat.She didn't turn around. She simply slipped into the driver's seat and pulled away.


Only Myron remained in the lot, the cat nudging at his leg.


He let out a quiet breath and scooped it up again.


"It stings a little, doesn't it?" he asked the animal.


"Meow."


"It's fine. I expected as much." He stroked the soft furry head and watched her taillights fade.






Millie reached home, cleaned up, and went straight  moot to bed.


She refused to overthink the encounter. Tomorrow's competition was all that mattered.


If everything went according to plan, she'd remove the mask at the end of the show.
###Chapter 141 I'm Just Getting Started


Sunlight spilled through the window as Millie woke, greeted by a cloudless, brilliant sky.

She paused for a moment, taking in the crisp blue above the city, and gave a determined nod.

The weather itself seemed to promise good fortune.

Today marked the long-awaited finals.

From the crack of dawn, chaos reigned.

Elaborate costumes and intricate hairstyles meant hours of work, so Millie arrived at the designer's studio well before schedule, determined to get every detail right.

Once her look was perfected, she slid into the backseat of the sedan and headed for the Heavenly Melody finals venue.

But as they approached, Millie immediately sensed something off.

Before she'd even set foot out of the car, she spotted a dense crowd swelling outside the recording studio.The energy was electric-excited, noisy, maybe even tense.

From inside the vehicle, she could only catch snippets of sound, indistinct but urgent.

Barbara, ever practical, leaned forward and instructed the driver to pull over a little ways off. "Serena, wait here," she said calmly. "I'll go see what's going on."

With that, she slipped from the car, disappearing into the bustling crowd to investigate.

Barbara soon returned, her expression clouded with worry.

"Should we try to drive straight in?" she inquired, glancing anxiously at the driver.

A prickle of unease shot through Millie. She stualied Barbara, waiting for an explanation.
Barbara finally broke, lowering her voice. "There are protesters up ahead-holding signs, making a scene..."

She trailed off, but Millie didn't need the rest spelled out.

"We're not getting through that crowd. We'll have to come up with another plan," Millie replied, her tone decisive. "They've probably spotted our car already. If we push our way in and things get ugly..."

She left the warning unfinished. The implication hung in the air.

One wrong move, and the finals would slip right through their fingers.

Just then, another car rolled past. Vivian's face pressed to the window, her eyes glittering with mischief."What's the holdup? Scared now?" she sneered, a mischievous smile lighting her lips.

Barbara shot Vivian a venomous glare before getting in. She slammed the car door so hard the whole sedan shook.

Without missing a beat, Millie urged the driver to pull away at once.

Just as the car pulled away, a swarm of potesters surged to their former parking spot, shouting and waving signs.

"Damn it!" Barbara muttered a sharp curse when she spotted them in the mirror, instantly realizing Vivian had deliberately tipped them off.

Thank God they'd left in time-if they'd hesitated even a second longer, they would have been completely surrounded.

Barbara's lips curled into a sly grin. "Well, look at that," she drawled, leaning forward. "Vivian's little stunt actually played right.into our hands."

The uproar over here had drawn away nearly all the protesters, leaving the entrance to the recording studio wide open.

Their sedan coasted effortlessly through the gate, slipping past the chaos and pulling up next to Vivian's flashy car.
Barbara hopped out first and helped Millie from the back seat, just as Vivían's eyes landed on them.She stood frozen, too stunned to even react.

Barbara spun on her heel and flashed Vivian a wide, taunting grin, finishing it off with an exaggerated eye roll that only made Vivian's expression darken.

Vivian's lips curled into a sneer. "Bask in it wwhile you can, Serena. This is the last time you'll ever get to feel proud."

Millie wasn't going to dignify that with a reply, but since it was the final round, she decided Vivian didn't deserve the satisfaction of silence.

She turned, catching the furious twist in her rival's features.

With a bold, unbothered smile, Millie answered, "Don't worry-I plan to. And trust me, I'm just getting started."

"You!" Vivian's temper snapped.

"Thinking about hitting her, huh?" Before Vivian could barrel forward, Barbara and the makeup artist darted in front of Millie.

Curious onlookers had already begun to gather, forcing Vivian to swallow her anger and rein in her temper.

"All you ever do is talk big," she muttered under her breath, and then spun on her heel and marched away.

The crowd's attention lingered on Millie, scrutinizing her every move.

Even Daphne gave a derisive snort as she swept past.

Millie paid them no mind and strode directly toward the backstage area.

Before long, the spat was already blowing up across social media.

The finals hadn't even kicked off, and the atmosphere was already crackling with tension.

On top of the crowds protesting Serena, a growing swarm of spectators had gathered, hungry for the unfolding drama.
With anticipation building, everyone waited breathlessly/ for the live broadcast to begin.

···

Despite nearly being hemmed in by the protesters outside, Millie still managed to slip backstage ahead of schedule. Inside, Daphne-unwilling to share even a corner of the space with Millie-had already retreated to a private lounge, leaving only a handful of staffers milling about behind the scenes.

With the contestants, judges and host all absent, the atmosphere backstage felt strangely deserted.

Some staff eyed Millie warily, their loyalties shifting according to each contestant's odds of winning.

In the end, no one ever approached her, and Millie found herself isolated in the middle of a wide, empty stretch of floor.

When Barbara tried to gather information, she ran straight into a wall of chilly indifference.

The cold-shoulder treatment reeked of Vivian's doing.

Clearly, their earlier confrontation had struck a nerve, and Vivian wasn't finished retaliating.

It was at that awkward moment that Jayceon and his siblings swept in and took in the scene.

Jayceon, never one to hide his feelings, barreled straight toward Millie with a thunderous scowl.

"Serena, crush it out there! I've got your back!" he hollered, his voice echoing off the high backstage ceiling.

Trailing just behind, Adriana rolled her eyes and promptly reached over to twist her brother's ear.

"Can you not? Don't startle her before she goes on stage," she groaned, barely suppressing her own exasperation at his theatrics.

Meanwhile, Myron trailed after them, giving Millie a warm nod and an easy smile when their eyes met.

Adriana's voice softened as she turned to Millie. "We debated coming back here, honestly. People love to talk, you know. But Jayceon's been a huge fan and the public already knows that, so it's not exactly a secret.We figured,why not?"
Jayceon bobbed his head in agreement, grinning.
True to form, Myron stayed mostly in the background, his expression quietly supportive, eyes shining with quiet amusement.
Millie glanced at the three of them, a flicker of envy stirring at the effortless closeness of the Elliott family.Even Barbara, who typically kept her distance, lingered nearby, visibly admiring their camaraderie. As Charles' assistant, she understood all too well the undercurrents of conflict that ran through the Evans family.
Millie felt immune to rumors and unfazed by the noisy protest outside.
What truly mattered were the people willing to stand beside her now-she cherished them all the more for it.Though the Elliott family already knew the truth, Millie's chest tightened with gratitude.
A genuine smile spread across her face as she stood. "Thank you,"she said, her voice steady, her eyes alight.
Adriana's lips curved into an easy smile, her eyes lighting with unspoken understanding as she met Millie's gaze.
"We can't wait to see what you'll do out there tonight," Myron offered, his tone gentle but sincere.
Millie hesitated briefly, and then returned a polite nod, her expression softening.
Adriana shot Myron a playful look before turning to Millie. "We'll go grab our seats. Don't keep us waiting too long,"she teased.
Millie smiled, her shoulders relaxing a fraction. "I'll do my best," she promised, a spark of warmth in her eyes.
As soon as the Elliott siblings disappeared down the hallway, the mood backstage subtly shifted. The once chilly staff now greeted Barbara's questions with a hint of warmth, their attitudes less frosty than before.
It was clear-the Elliott name carried weight, and their support meant something, even if few backstage truly believed Serena could win.

And even if she somehow did win, in their eyes, her reputation had long ruined.

The Elliott family's appearance seemed less about support and more a reflection of Jayceon's open admiration for Serena-or perhaps a curiosity to see if her talent could eclipse the taint of scandal.

As the Elliott family made their exit, the remaining contestants and the judges trickled in, almost every one deliberately steering clearof Millie.

She noticed their avoidance but simply brushed it off.

Out in the audience, Brandon kept glancing at the empty seat beside him.

Several days ago, he'd mentioned the show and asked Millie if she planned to attend. She'd promised she would, so he'd sent her a message with the details and saved a spot for her.

Now, as the minutes ticked by and the crowd settled, he couldn't help but wonder if she would actually show.
###Chapter 142 Who Is The Woman That Caught Myron's Attention
The live broadcast of Heavenly Melody was in full swing, and the audience seats were quickly filling up.
A few rows from Brandon, Myron, Jayceon, and Adriana had already taken their seats.
The three were chatting, their voices low, but bits of their conversation drifted over to Brandon.

"Myron, come on! That perfect gentleman charade? Just drop it! What if she's not into that?" Jayceon teased, though it wasn't cear who they were talking about.
He added, "You know her type isn't exactly what you'repretending to be."
Myron replied smoothly, "And how do you know I'm not a real gentleman?"
Jayceon made a dramatic gagging sound and threw his sister a look.
Adriana rolled her eyes at Myron. "Please. You? A real gentleman? You're a wolf in sheep's clothing."
Jayceon sighed. "Exactly. And don't forget you dragged me along as your perfect excuse when you were the one desperately wanted to see her. You said youhad a plan, but I bet your whole plan is just scheming how to win her over."
Adriana nodded in agreement and pointed at Myron. "You're no gentleman at all. One day, I'll tell her the truth about you!"
Myron only chuckled, calm and unfazed, as if he had everything under control.
Brandon looked over at them and found Myron staring right back.
Leaning into his seat with ease, Myron turned his head slightly and gave Brandon a small, deliberate nod-like he had sensed Brandon's eyes on him all along.
Brandon returned the nod quietly and then looked away. But something about it lingered in his mind.
Who were the Elliott siblings talking about?
It sounded like Myron had his eye on someone.

That didn't happen often.

Whoever it was must be someone special.

Brandon glanced at the empty seat next to him and picked up his phone.

"The show's about to start. You should get here soon, or you'll miss it," he texted Millie. But just like before,there was no reply.

Brandon's brows creased slightly.

Not far away, Jayceon and Adriana were exchanging glances, clearly up to something. They kept gesturing between Brandon and Myron, whispering and nudging each other like kids sharing a secret.

Eventually, Myron cleared his throat, and the two instantly straightened up.

Meanwhile, Vivian was watching closely.

Her eyes kept returning to the empty seat beside Brandon. Seeing it still unoccupied, she clenched her fists.

Brandon had told her he was inviting Millie. He'd even said that if it made Vivian uncomfortable, he would seat Millie among the general audience.

But to keep up her image of being"sweet and understandinVivian had insisted he sit Millie nearby.

"You still care for each other, even if you're divorced," Vivian had said with a pale smile. "Besides... I don't have much time left. In the future, she'll still be the one beside you."

But now-Vivian looked away.

"Millie, you better not show up... Or I'll teach you a lesson you'll never forget," she whispered

Then, as if struck by a thought, she turned and walked toward the host.



As more time passed, the show officially began?
<###Chapter 142 Who Is The Woman That Caught Myron's Attention                                      +80 Points ot mout The host stepped on stage and introduced the opening performer-Karlee Sutton, a 28-year-old music prodigy.
The atmosphere instantly shifted, Excitement buzzed through the room.
Karlee chose a soft, lyrical piece so as not to overshadow the contestants, but her presence still lit up the stage.

When she finished and bowed slightly, the crowd burst into applause.
The host then welcomed the judges to the stage.
"Coming through,guys! Please make way for the judges," a staff member called out.
Vivian and two other judges took the stage and gave their speeches before the final round began.

Backstage, Millie and the other contestants waited for their turn.
"It's gone by so fast. I can't believe we've reached the finals. I'm not ready to say goodbye," Vivian said with a soft smile. Her eyes looked a little red.
The audience quietly nodded along.
Vivian continued, her voice calm, "Though my time is running out, I know when I'm gone, I'll remember these days fondly. They'll bring me tears of joy."
She took a deep breath and then announced, "During the break later, I'll post fifty invitation cards on my social media. If anyone wishes to attend, please use one to come to my funeral a few months from now."She bowed, her eyes wet with emotion.
"I hope you'll come dressed in your best. I want you all to live boldly, and with spirit. And I hope none of you think attending a stranger's funeral would bring you bad luck."
Tears filled the eyes of many in the crowd. Someone shouted, "Not at all! We love you, Vivian! And we just feel sorry for you!"
Online chatter exploded.
Fans were full of sympathy, eager to know how to get a card.

"Only 50? I hope I can get one."

"Vivian's just trying not to bother people. She wants to keep it low-key."

"She's always so thoughtful. I'm honestly in tears."

"Millie, show your face! See how graceful Vivian is. Don't you feel ashamed?"

One harsh comment even read-"I'd rather trade Millie's life for Vivian's."①

That post quickly topped the trending list, racking up the most likes.

After speaking, Vivian left the stage, letting the next judge step forward.

Her eyes scanned the audience, confirming that the seat beside Brandon was still empty.

Lowering her head, she adjusted her outfit, and a faint glimmer of satisfaction lit her eyes.

"Come on, Millie. Show yourself. Let's see how you plan to handle this," Vivian thought.

Backstage, Millie had been watching everything unfold with a calm expression.

She noticed Vivian's frequent glances toward the audience-more specifically, at the empty seat beside Brandon.

She knew it had been reserved for her.

And she also knew Vivian's entire speech was aimed at stirring emotions and pressuring her.

Vivian's PR team really knew how to create a scene. They always had something up their sleeves-and this time was no different.

But Millie only smiled faintly. Vivian's plan wouldn't work.

She wouldn't be walking into the audience. She would be wNalking onto the stage.

Her eyes drifted to Brandon.
He was still staring at the empty seat, brows slightly furrowed, clearly lost in thought.

A few rows down, Jayceon and Adriana had their heads together, whispering and giggling like kids plotting something. Myron sat quietly nearby, half-hidden in the shadows, unreadable.

"Now, let's welcome today's first contestant-Daphne!" the host announced, marking the true start of the final round.
###Chapter 143 Serena Reshapes Herself Amid Resistance


The roar of the crowd swelled as Daphne made her entrance, basking in the spotlight.

The lights overhead slowly came to life, washing the stage in a gentle glow as she began her performance.

Known as a rising star among the latest batch of contestants, Daphne's powerful performance drew wave after wave of applause.

Meanwhile, behind the curtain, MMillie waited patiently while Barbara paced restlessly at her side.

This time, Millie would be the third to take the stage.

Stil, the running order felt insignificant as this was the grand finale of the show, with only three contenders left. To add excitement and fill the airtime for audience voting, the producers had also brought back the previously eliminated contestants to re-appear after the main performances.

Daphne, fresh from her set and brimming wvith satisfaction, wasted no time approaching Millie.

She squared her shoulders, holding her head high as she stopped right in front of Millie.

"The second contestant is already out there, you know. There's still a window for you to back out if you want,Serena," Daphne taunted, a sly grin spreading across her face.

Everyone nearby observed in silence, most casting curious looks in Millie's direction.

Alex looked like he wanted to intervene, but in the end, he kept his thoughts to himself.

Right now, Millie understood she couldn't afford to get sidetracked by Daphne.

She rose from her seat, locking eyes with Daphne.

Spotting the smugness in Daphne's smile, Millie responded with a small, unbothered grin of her own.

"I appreciate your concern," MMillie answered evenly. "But I won't be needing it."
Millie didn't bother glancing back at Daphne. Instead, she strode purposefully toward the corridor that led to the stage, her mind made up.

Life was a series of unpredictable twists, and she knew it was impossible to win over everyone. All she could do was step forward and give her all, knowing she'd done right by herself.

For her, that was more than enough.

Her heels tapped a steady rhythm down the corridor, and with a gentle nudge from the staff, Millie stepped onto the stage just as the previous performer exited.

Pitch blackness enveloped the stage while she held her ground, waiting as the host caught the cue to begin.

"Up next, we have Serena-" The host's announcement was abruptly cut off as a piercing shout erupted from the crowd.

"Serena,we don't want you here!"

"Step down,Serena!"

"Go home,Serena!"

The shouts intensified, and before long, a few people began hurling things at thestage.

Charles,having prepared for this very moment, quickly dispatched security to restore order.

Wiping sweat from his brow, the host pressed on as instructed. "Let's hear it for Serena, performing 'Sculpture,"

Without another word, he hurried offstage.

Over at the judges' panel, Vivian watched the drama unfold with barely concealed satisfaction.

"Let's see you claw your way out of this, Serena," Vivian thought, a hint of a smile on her lips.

Right then, Mlillie held her position beneath the shadows, and as the lights slowly rose, the audience found themselves witnessing a scene that felt straighê out of a dream.
At the center stood Serena with her mask, half of her body in reality and half seemingly encased in plaster.
The unusual sight left the audience unsettled, and hushed questions rippled through the rows. "What are we even looking at?"
No one had answers.
"It doesn't matter. Kick Serena out!" someone shouted, fanning the flames
"Throw Serena out! She's a disgrace!"
"Serena, you don't belong here!"
Angry chants ricocheted through the auditorium.
On the sidelines, Millie's costume designer watched with a pounding heart, all nerves and worry as Serena remained motionless under the lights.
A soft, rhythmic tapping suddenly broke through the noise, gentle as a sculptor shaping stone.
To the steady rhythm of the tapping, Serena, her face still half-shielded in plaster, softly began her song,weaving the story of a forsaken sculpture who, awakened by Muse's kiss, found the will to carve her own form.
Note by note, the plaster seemed to crumble away, each verse hinting at her transformation and rebirth.
Her voice held an unusual, hypnotic pull, drawing every eye and ear of the audience.
Even the most vocal protesters fell silent, unable to tear their eyes away from the masked Serena as she commanded the stage.
Vivian immediately sensed the mood shift and sent a discreet message to Oakley beneath the table.
Soon, fresh unrest broke out. Someone in the crowd started stirring up dissent once again.
Those who refused to join in the boycott were met with glares and harsh words from the people around them.   
  "What's wrong with you? Why are you so quiet? Anyone who defends Serena must be just as twisted-she's
a liar who scammed charity money! You think that's admirable? You need your head checked!"

"I'm not defending her! Don't pin that on me!"

"Prove it, then! Stand with us! Shout it out! Boycott Serena!"

°Fine,I will!"

"Boycott Serena!"

"Down with Serena!"

A fresh surge of angry chants swept through the audience, louder than before.

Vivian looked on from her seat, a sly smile curving her lips as the wave of outrage grew.

Millie stood back, taking in every detail.

This was exactly the chain reaction she had anticipated.

Vivian always played dirty, and Millie knew her style all too well.

Scheming was Vivian's specialty, but Millie decided to turn the tide by embracing it.

Vivian tried to bury her under a mountain of scandals.

Millie, instead, would use those very rumors as her tools, transforming herself in plain sight for everyone to see.

Clutching the microphone like a sculptor's tool, Serena let every fierce shout from the crowd fuel her performance, each note shaping her image once more on stage.

With every rising shout from the crowd, the layers of plaster seemed to crack and fall from her body at an even quicker pace.

Every cruel rumor and whispered insult became an invisible chisel, chipping away the old and carving out someone stronger in its place. 
"Down with Serena!"
"Get Serena off that stage!"
Out in the crowd, Brandon's brow creased in thought as he glanced at the empty seat next to him.
Millie was still nowhere to be found.
She'd given her word she'd be there today. So why hadn't she shown up?
Did it have to do with Vivian's connection to the event, or was there another reason entirely? Or could it be something entirely different?
Uncertain, Brandon tore his eyes away from the vacant seat and fixed his attention back on Serena, masked and transformed under the lights.
Right then, as the music soared, the last traces of plaster slipped away, leaving her standing in the spotlight,fully revealed.
It was as if a sudden gust swept through, scattering every remnant of her old self and unveiling the new.
A heartbeat later, the soundtrack shifted, gone were the delicate sculpting sounds, replaced by a fierce,pulsing rhythm that filled the arena.
It felt as though the plaster itself had finished its transformation and was now embracing a brand new existence.
A hypnotic beat, paired with vocals that carried both mastery and emotion, turned the dreamlike stage into a spectacle no one could look away from.
Every move of her powerful dance, blending different styles yet executed with perfect control, let her belt out each note with unwavering strength, even as the choreography pushed her limits, she never faltered.
Every element, narrative, skill, artistry, and even the tension of the crowd's chanting inside and out, was seamlessly blended into the fabric of her performance.
She was absolutely mesmerizing!
Even Oakley, who'd come solely to orchestrate chaos, found himself in awe, unable to tear his gaze away.

Fortunately for Vivian, she'd seized the moment to exploit the uproar over Serena's donation scandal.Without that controversy, Charles could have risen to incredible heights with someone this talented by his side.

That thought drew a sly grin across Oakley's face as he glanced at Charles.

"Don't look at me like that. I didn't do anything," Oakley teased, his tone smug. "I just wanted a front row seat when you crash and burn."

He tossed Charles a taunting smile. "Can't wait to see the look on your face if that happens!"

Back on stage, Serena stood tall, her body now completely revealed, with only her face still hidden behind the unsculpted plaster.
###Chapter 144 Shattering The Mask Inch By Inch


Charles looked at Oakley and suddenly let out a quiet chuckle.

Oakley stared at him, confused.

"Do you know something?" Charles said, his voice surprisingly calm for someone with a reputation for being hot-tempered."You and Reuben misjudged me and completely underestimated Serena."

Oakley burst out laughing, as though he'd just heard a ridiculous joke.

"What are you even talking about, Charles?" he said, thinking back over the past few days.

After the fourth live broadcast of the show, Oakley and Vivian had fallen out. But she eventually came back with a show of sincerity and proved herself capable of turning the charity fraud accusation against Serena into a weapon.

Oakley accepted her back and agreed to take charge of everything related to the Evans family for her.

"Still trying to fight back?" he said. "Remember that meeting when you were cornered? If it hadn't been for Brandon's move and Jayceon stepping in as Serena's fan, she would've been forced to quit the competition immediately. And now, with Reuben and me watching closely, there's no way you can manipulate the auction records to clear her name. Even if a donation appears after, we'll twist it and ruin your reputation even more."

Oakley studied Charles carefully. But Charles only met his gaze with a faint, unreadable smile that made Oakley uneasy.

Though Charles remained silent, something about him unsettled Oakley.

He replayed the recent events in his mind all over again, glancing at the woman on stage, her face still hidden behind the plaster mask, and then back at Charles.

"Serena's reputation is already in shambles," Oakley said. "Forget the accusations of sleeping her way to the top-if the charity fraud is confirmed, there's no coming back from that. I know your people have been trying to clean things up, but it's pointless."

Oakley's heart was pounding now as he spoke. A small doubt crept in. Could Serena actually be innocent?He quickly dismissed it.

The charity auction had been organized by the Evans family. Despite their internal struggles, Oakley and Reuben had personally overseen the verificätion process. Charles might have been able to keep Serena's identity a secret so far, but he couldn't have messed with the donation records and fooled both of themn at once.

Oakley was certain Serena hadn't placed a bidor made any donation that night.

So what was Charles playing at? Was he only bluffing?

After going over it again, Oakley relaxed and scoffed. "You're insane, Charles. Still clinging to some impossible miracle."

Charles just shrugged and turned back to the stage. "Think what you want."

His only responsibility tonight was to keep tabs on Oakley.

He smiled faintly. "Maybe a miracle really will happen."

...

Backstage, the atmosphere was tense as Serena performed under the stage lights. Everyone watched with different expressions.

Just days ago, Daphne had publicly lashed out at Serena-an incident no one had forgotten.

Among the guests attending the recording,'all were music professionals or experienced contestants-except for Vivian, though most assumed she was,too.

Now, as Serena performed, people exchanged looks. Some couldn't help glancing at Daphne.

Daphne clenched her jaw but sat upright, trying to appear unshaken.
Even if Serena's performance was brilliant, it wouldn't change the public backlash. The scandal was too big.She would still be disqualified and rejected. At least, that was what Daphne told herself.

Still, somewhere deep inside, she felt a small sense of relief that the charity fraud allegations had ruined Serena's chances.


···

On stage, the woman in the plaster mask kept singing.

Her movements shifted fluidly from one dance style to another, like a statue newly brought to life,experimenting with all possible artistic formns.

There was chaos. Beauty. A fusion of styles that defied labels.

As the music built, she lifted the microphone that looked like a sculptor's chisel toward her own mask, the only part of her body still uncarved.

The audience held its breath.

For a month now, speculation about Serena's real identity had stirred conversation online.

Heavenly Melody only accepted performers under the age of twenty-five.

Yet, despite endless searching, no one had been able to match Serena's voice, talent, or style to anyone in that age group. This was specially surprising given how under scrutiny she was after her explosive third stage performance.

Her musical skill. was undeniable. Her stagepresence, unmatched. Even when rumors spread during the fourth round that Evans Entertainment was backing her, her talent shut them down.

And now, this mysterious Serena pointed the chisel-shaped microphone at her mask.

Those who had once been chanting for her to be disqualified fell silent, staring at the stage.

"Ding!"

A sharp, clear sound echoed-the sound of the sculptor's chisel.
A small piece of plaster fell from her chin, revealing her red lips.
The audience finally remembered to breathe-only to hold their breath again.
In the judges' section, Vivian's fingers clenched tightly.
She didn't understand what Serena was trying to do.
Even if she showed her face, how would that change anything?
Vivian and Oakley had gone over everything multiple times. On the day of the charity auction, Serena's bid number hadn't been used at all.
They'd even explored the far-fetched scenario of Serena and Charles being secretly married, which might've made his purchase count as hers.
But Oakley had checked. Charles was still legally single.
Even if they'd married afterward, they could easily twist the story and call it a cover-up.
Vivian's phone buzzed.
She glanced down, checking the screen under the table.
It was a message from Oakley."Something feels wrong. What is Serena doing? Should we stop her?"
She thought for a moment and replied, "Whatever she's planning, we stick to the original plan.This time,we'll drag both Serena and Charles down."
"Still...I have a really bad feeling about this."
"You don't trust me?"
"Not that, Just... something feels off."
Vivian was about to reply again when her gaze shifted toward Brandon in the audience.
He was frowning, eyes fixed on the stage.
That strange sense of familiarity had returned.
From the moment he first saw this masked woman,he'd felt it.
Who was she?
"Ding!"
The sculptor's chisel struck again.
Serena raised the microphone to her forehead. Just like that, the plaster there began to fall.
Now, only the space from her eyebrows to the tip of her nose remained hidden.
###Chapter 145 Serena Turns Out To Be Millie


Every gaze in the recording studio locked onto Serena as she commanded the stage, Vivian's eyes among them burning with intensity.

What had begun as Oakley's solitary unease now rippled through Vivian's consciousness-something about the face beneath that mask stirred memories she couldn't quite grasp.

Millie moved with liquid grace across the stage, her fingers working deliberately at the mask's edges,exposing fragments of her true face with theatrical precision. Through the remaining plaster, her eyes sought Brandon's distant figure in the sea of spectators.

His brow had creased into worried lines, confusion clouding his expression like storm clouds gathering overhead.

Millie's mouth curved into a knowing smile beneath the crumbling disguise.

The charade had reached its final act.

Her gaze dropped momentarily before her right hand rose with deliberate slowness.

The sharp crack of splitting plaster sliced through the hushed auditorium.

Half the mask exploded into powder, fragments dancing away on the evening breeze.

Brandon's eyes contracted to pinpoints, recognition dawning across his features with brutal clarity.

Only one delicate shard clung to Serena's face now, the last barrier between truth and revelation.

Murmurs rippled through the crowd as awareness began its slow burn.

Brandon's mouth compressed into a bloodless line. His stare burned into the figure onstage, torn between desperate denial and the terrifying need for confirmation.

Serena remained motionless, her head tilted Eownward in a moment of perfect stillness. Her right hand moved with gentle finality.
The last fragment of her plaster mask surrendered to gravity.
Wind swept across the stage, liberating her hair to flow like liquid silk. As she raised her head with agonizing slowness, those familiar locks framed her revealed face, exposing her identity to every shocked observer.

Brandon exploded from his seat, eyes stretched wide with disbelief, his entire body trembling as he gaped at the transformed woman onstage.

The audience detonated into chaos, screams of astonishment tearing through the night air.

"That's Millie!"

"Serena was actually Millie this entire time?! How-"

"Wait a second! So she's really Millie? As in... Brandon's wife?"

"This defies belief! Millie's supposed to be nothing more than a spoiled trophy wife! How could she possibly be Serena?"

"Someone's playing an elaborate trick on us!"
"Maybe this is all wrong? Did Serena realize she couldn't save her reputation and convince Millie to participate in some twisted performance?"

Disbelief crashed over the crowd like ocean waves against stubborn cliffs.

Serena's genius had blazed undeniably bright, particularly after her triumphant third performance. Even when the donation fraud scandal had tried to destroy her reputation, no soul had questioned the raw power of her artistry.

During the scandalous fourth show, when vicious rumors had swirled around Serena, she had once again silenced every critic through pure artistic brilliance.
But now reality stood naked before them-Serena had been that supposedly pampered housewife all along?The same woman whose husband paraded pâblicly with Vivian, practically announcing their affair to the world while she waited silently at home for Vivian's influence to diminish, her eyes fixed on the Watson family fortune? The same woman everyone believed to never ever measure up to Vivian's legendary twenty-five-second musical masterpiece?

The revelation stretched beyond the boundaries of human comprehension.

"This cannot be happening! What we're witnessing defies all logic-it must be an elaborate deception!"

Hysteria erupted from countless throats as the auditorium plunged into absolute pandemonium.

From his position at the rear, Charles observed Millie's commanding presence onstage with quiet satisfaction before his attention shifting to Oakley's ashen face beside him.

"You see, sometimes there really are miracles," Charles murmured, his smile carrying the weight of vindication.

Oakley remained transfixed by Millie's revealed identity, his expression carved from pure disbelief as his world crumbled around him.

Only after forcing himself to process the impossible reality before him did Oakley rotate toward Charles with mechanical stiffness, terror blazing in his widened eyes.

The screaming crescendoed as hundreds of faces swiveled between Vivian's frozen figure on stage and Brandon's shocked figure in the concealed seating area.

Vivian stood paralyzed by the magnitude of what she had discovered.

Oakley's earlier warning message had planted seeds of worry in her mind, and her own instincts had whispered danger, yet nothing had prepared her for this earth-shattering revelation.

Her memory conjured Brandon's casual mention that Millie would grace today's performance, how he had thoughtfully reserved the seat directly beside his own for his wife's arrival. But not a single soul had breathed a word that Serena was actually Millie.

A violent tremor seized Vivian as her past actions crashed over her. She remembered wth crystal clarity how she had cornered Serena backstage, hervoice dripping with calculated menace as she attempted to forge an alliance against Millie.

If her eyes weren't deceiving her now, then every scheme she'd crafted crumbled into pathetic comedy.

Denial clawed at her throat-Serena and Millie existing as the same person violated every law of probability and logic.

Vivian's head snapped toward Brandon with desperate urgency.

He remained motionless as carved marble, his entire being focused on Millie's figure bathed in stage lights.

His mind reeled against the evidence of his own eyes.

How could this extraordinary woman possibly be Millie, the wife he thought he knew intimately? How had he failed so completely to recognize the person who shared seven intimate years of his life?

Their history stretched back to childhood innocence and youthful dreams. Seven years together as partners had woven their lives together through countless shared experiences. Endless intimate moments had mapped every detail of her presence into his memory. She had occupied the space beside him for so long-how could he fail to recognize her after she just put a mask on?

His mind dragged him back to that first encounter with Serena, replaying the scene with painful clarity.

She had appeared wrapped in an elegant coat while Charles guided her through the backstage maze with protective care.

Then came Serena's debut performance, burned forever into Brandon's consciousness.

Her slender silhouette had been draped in that rose-red costume, the mysterious mask concealing her identity. The stage lights carved harsh shadows across her form, exposing the extensive bruising that painted her skin in shades of purple and yellow, making her appear fragile enough to shatter with the next breath.

His consciousness conjured that moment in the sterile hospital-Millie's voice calling his name after her devastating fall down the stairs, that single word "Brandon" now echoing endlessly through his memory.

His right hand quivered as memory dragged him back to that night after her first performance, when he'd pulled her aside for a word. She had swayed on her feet like a broken reed, her body eventually surrendering to exhaustion before Charles swept her away to safety.

Brandon's legs threatened to buckle beneath him, his jaw locked in a rigid line while his mouth compressed into a bloodless slash.

Though his face appeared carved from marble, anyone who truly understood him could read the hurricane of emotions tearing through his very foundation.

How had he failed so catastrophically to recognize Millie? Could a simple mask truly possess the-power to blind him to the woman whose soul had intertwined with his for countless years? The answer struck him like a physical blow-absolutely not.

From their very first encounter, Serena had awakened something achingly familiar within him-her distinctive vocal style, her extraordinary musical intuition, and that inexplicable sense of recognition that had haunted him whenever she graced the stage. Yet he had systematically crushed every instinct that whispered the truth.

Vivian's words echoed through his tortured thoughts-her claim that reliable sources had revealed Serena's tragic miscarriage following a devastating fall just ten days before the live performance, explaining her absence from crucial rehearsals.

During those conversations, Vivian had planted seeds of suspicion that Serena belonged to Charles, that their relationship extended far beyond professional boundaries.

Brandon's hands contracted into trembling fists, his knuckles whitening under the strain.

His vision blurred with unshed tears.

In his memory, Millie had never possessed Serena's ethereal thinness, her almost ghostly fragility.

Only mere days had separated his final glimpse of Millie in that sterile hospital room and Serena's breathtaking stage debut.

His logical mind couldn't comprehend how anyone could shed such dramatic weight in such an impossibly brief timeframe.
This rationalization had become his fortress against recognition.

But their later encounter at Moonlit Estate-

He had witnessed firsthand how dramatically she had withered away, how she shivered uncontrollably even during April's mild warmth, and how weakness had settled into her bones. Why had his heart remained so stubbornly blind to what his eyes were desperately trying to show him?

His fingernails carved crescents into his palms as Brandon fixed his burning gaze on Millie's triumphant form, vertigo washing over him in crushing waves.

Drowning in the depths of his shock and self-recrimination, Brandon remained completely oblivious to Myron's penetrating surveillance from the shadowed recesses a few rows away.

Myron's-characteristic gentleness had evaporated completely, replaced by a gaze that pierced Brandon with arctic hostility, every glance promising retribution for sins yet to be acknowledged.
###Chapter 146 Heaviness


Millie's image appeared on the screen, leaving the entire crowd speechless with shock.

Backstage, Daphne stared at the screen in disbelief, mumbling under her breath that there had to be some mistake.

Social media exploded in real time.

People who'd just been shouting insults were now frantically denying what they saw, picking apart every detail in search of something to disprove it.

"This has to be a setup! Millie and Serena clearly reached some kind of deal!"

For some, this was the only explanation left to cling to.

But Seville sprang into action. "Haha, we've waited for this, pretending, enduring, just for the perfect reveal!"

Without hesitation, he instructed his team to kick off an all-out pushback.

"There's no scam! Millie and Serena are one and the same! And let's not forget, Brandon donated millions at auction, and he's her husband! You see? He was using their money, so she did contribute!"

"Exactly! And all that talk about sleeping her way to the top was baseless. Serena's ranking came from pure talent, not some shady deal!"

"Every accusation was part of a smear campaign. Serena's achievements were earned fair and square!"

"The tables have turned. Everything's changed now!"

"Wait, don't get ahead of yourselves, guys. Where's the concrete proof that Millie and Serena are actually the same person? Maybe they're just putting on a show together to distract us from the donation fraud thing?"

Online chaos erupted, yet right there on the Heavenly Melody stage, Millie stood her ground, refusing to step away even after her true identity was unveiled.

In fact, it was at that exact moment that her performance reached its peak.

Up until now, every note had felt like watching a statue in progress, still rough and unfinished, but with the final mask falling from her face, a genuine transformation took place.

No longer held back by judgment or scandal, she unleashed a breathtaking display that made everyone sit up and recognize her radiance.

Bathed in the spotlight, Millie sang with fearless intensity, her clear, haunting voice and flawless skil matching Serena's unforgettable performances from the past few rounds.

With every last remnant of plaster gone, a renewed version of herself emerged for all to witness.

Both her song and her presence spoke of reinvention, Millie and Serena, past and present, now fully united as one.

A dramatic run of soaring notes closed out her act, each pitch lifting her higher, rising above pain and doubt,just as she'd risen through each challenge on the show.

In truth, there was no separation between Millie and Serena. Both identities belonged to her, seamlessly woven together on that stage.

When the final chord faded, the crowd was struck silent.

All previous protests had melted away, and not even a whisper remained as everyone absorbed the magnitude of what they'd just seen.

A gentle "Thank you," fell from Millie's lips as she bowed, her voice echoing in the hushed auditorium.

The crowd exploded in applause, their cheers roaring so loudly it felt as if the whole building might shake.

"Serena, you're incredible!"

"Absolutely stunning,Serena!"
"Forget that! Millie is the real star!"

"It doesn't matter who you are! We're with you, Millie or Serena!"

"Wait, wasn't there a scandal about donations?"

"Give it a rest! She's Brandon's wife, so the money was theirs together. And let's not forget, if Serena hadn't been bidding that night, the tanzanite wouldn't have sold for nearly as much!"

"Exactly!"

"Let's show her our support! Serena deserves it!"

"I'm in! Go, Serena!"

The wave of celebration wasn't limited to the venue. It also echoed across the Internet,too.

A country that once booed her now rose to their feet, unified in admiration, as her performance became a living,breathing work of art.

"Unbelievable! Serena's a powerhouse! I'll always support her!" Jayceon leapt from his seat, unable to contain his excitement.

Adriana, unusually generous, let her brother cheer as much as he wanted. She glanced at Brandon,quietly settled in his seat, and then at Myron lurking in the shadows, and let out a gentle laugh.

Adriana caught a sharp look from Myron and quickly dropped her eyes.

Not wasting a second, Myron shifted his focus to Brandon.

Brandon sat motionless, his expression unreadable, but a heaviness clung to him that Myron couldn't miss.

A quiet laugh slipped from Myron before he looked away.

Onstage, Millie was ready to leave, but the audience was nowhere near finished, their voices rising in a chorus begging her to stay a littlelonger.

Eventually, the host returned to bring order. "WVhat an incredible run! From 'Yesterday' to 'Us,' then 'Deep Sea,' 'Journey' and now 'Sculpture,' Serena has amazed us at every turn! I know you want more of her live magic, but she needs a break tonight. Don't worry. There will be plenty of opportunities to see Serena again soon!"


...

As the applause still echoed in the hall, Millie slipped backstage.

Barbara and Charles were quick to join her.

Tears streamed down Barbara's face. "Serena, I had no idea! And to think I defended Vivian at first..."

Her emotions tumbled between excitement and remorse.

With a gentle smile, Millie reached out and brushed away Barbara's tears.

"You goof, we made sure to keep everyone in the dark. There's no way you could've known." Millie let out a gentle laugh. "Besides, you figured out what Vivian was really like by yourself, didn't you? Stop blaming yourself. You're sobbing like a little kid," Millie teased, brushing away more of Barbara's tears.

Charles jumped in, offering a few reassuring words and even promising Barbara a bonus, which drew an embarrassed grin from her.

The three of them wandered backstage, chatting and sharing a few laughs.

They soon crossed paths with Vivian, her features twisted in barely contained fury.

Vivian's gaze, sharp and cold, locked onto Millie.

Sensing the tension, Charles instinctively moved to shield Millie.

Vivian barely glanced at Charles before stepping closer,

A faint, mocking smile crossed Vivian's lips as she looked at Millie."SO, Charles is your knight in shining armor now?"

Millie met Vivian's glare without flinching. "I have no idea what you're trying to say."
Vivian scoffed, her tone icy, "You really think hiding behind Charles is going to save your ass? Please.Brandon's already thrown you aside, Millie. In the end, you're nothing but yesterday's news. Even as Serena,what does it matter? Do you honestly think Brandon will ever take you back?"

Charles tensed up and cut in sharply, "That's enough, Vivian!"

Vivian ignored him completely, her attention fixed on Millie.

"So this is it, Millie? Hiding behind Charles now?" Vivian sneered.

Millie kept her smile light. "You know, I honestly don't get it. Why do you despise me so much?" she asked,her tone curious. "You always wanted Brandon, right? Well, he's all yours now. So why the bitterness?Besides..." Millie gave Vivian a knowing look. "You might want to hold onto him tight-he has a habit of slipping away."

Vivian offered no reply, choosing instead to glare daggers at Millie.

There was no way she could let Millie find out or even suspect her illness was just a ruse.

Vivian still hadn't won Brandon over for good. She couldn't afford any mistakes now.

A moment later, Vivian's expression softened, turning frail and innocent as she glanced past Millie."Oh Brandon, you're here."

Millie turned to find Brandon walking over, his expression tangled with conflicting emotions.

Brandon gave Vivian a nod, and then moved to take Millie aside for a private word.

Before he could touch her, Millie slipped deftly out of reach.

"We need to talk, Millie..." Brandon started, concern shadowing his face, but before he could finish, a new voice chimed in.

Brandon glanced up to find Myron standing there, grinning at him.
###Chapter 147 Vivian Contributed Nothing At All


Brandon immediately grew alert, his eyes narrowing with a cold gleam as he stared at Myron.

"Yes, Myron, stop him!" Jayceon called out, hurrying over with Adriana close behind.

Myron remained calm.

"Whatever you have to say to Millie, say it here," he said with a polite smile, though there was a clear note of warning in his eyes. "Don't try to intimidate her."

Brandon paused, glancing from Myron's face to Millie, silently asking for her take.

"There's nothing between us, if that's what you're thinking," Myron said directly. "I just admire Serena."

"And I do too!" Jayceon added, as if eager to be heard. "I've been a huge fan for ages. Everyone knows that."

Adriana nodded in agreement.

The air was thick with tension.

Just then, Vivian tried to speak in a pitiful tone. "Brandon, you all..."

"Shut up," Charles snapped, clearly fed up."I've never met anyone as two-faced as you."

"Charles," Brandon cut in, frowning as if to restrain him.

"What,you got a problem?" Charles shot back. "You left Millie for her? You-"

"It's my fault," Vivian interrupted, already in tears. "I didn't know Serena was..."

"You-" Charles was livid, but there was nothing he could do. He clenched his fists, silently fuming.

"If we're going to talk, let's do it properly. Stop crying and be clear," Adriana said sharply before turning to Brandon. "Mr. Watson, didn't you want to say something to Millie? Let's all hear it, so there's no room for It all happened in a flash. Voices rose, emotions flared, and heads turned to watch the unfolding drama

Millie, meanwhile, was growing impatient. She looked at Brandon. "Like they said-if you have something to say,say it."

A flicker of sadness passed through Brandon's eyes

He opened his mouth, hesitated, and then looked around at everyone. Whatever he had planned to say,he swallowed it back.

Millie stood still, watching him.

After a few seconds of silence, Brandon finally spoke. "Millie, can we talk privately sometime?"

She looked at him with quiet sympathy.

"No," she said gently.

Then, turning away, she added, "I just finished performing. I'm tired and need to rest."

She turned to the Elliott siblings, offered them a polite smile, and thanked them.

Then, to Charles and Barbara, she said, "Let's go. I'm thirsty."

Not once did she look back at Brandon or Vivian.

Charles caught on right away. "There's water in the lounge. Let's go."

Millie nodded.

As they neared the stairs and moved closer to the camera's frame, Brandon finally turned, watching Millie's retreating figure with aching eyes.

"Millie," he called after her softly.

But she didn't turn around.
Supported by Barbara, she carried her costume and disappeared around the corner.

Only the Elliott trio, Brandon, and Vivian remained.

Jayceon and Adriana had already moved on, chatting about what to eat next. Myron listened quietly as he walked with them.

Brandon lowered his gaze, staring at the spot where Millie had stood. A trace of her costume's plaster was still clinging to the floor.

Vivian saw it too. She clenched her teeth in frustration but didn't dare show it.

She feigned innocence. "I really didn't know Serena was Millie."

She added meaningfully, "Didn't they say during the first broadcast that she'd been injured ten days ago and couldn't rehearse?"

Brandon still didn't respond.

Jayceon, suddenly turned back with a curious look. "I heard she really was hurt. Fell down the stairs,apparently." He leaned into the gossip, voice tinged with sarcasm. "It was pretty bad. I heard she couldn't even get out of bed for days."

He went on with deliberate mockery. "Makes you wonder how such an accident happened in the first place."

Brandon's fingers twitched slightly. His eyes were fixed on the faint trail of plaster left behind.

Jayceon turned to Adriana. "You're a woman. What would you do if you were in her shoes?"

Adriana played along. "What else? I'd move on and find someone truly cherish me this time."

Jayceon nodded in agreement.

Vivian was furious, but she held back, keeping up her act.

Just as she was about to speak, Jayceon cut her off. "That medical report Charles gave was definitely fake-the timeline simply didn't add up. But everyone saw how Millie was before the performance-those injuries were real. And Serena's condition on the earlier broadcasts? Anyone with eyes could tell."
Vivian couIdn't keep quiet anymore. "Mr. Elliott, are you defending her because you like her?"

Jayceon looked genuinely amused. "Of course I like her. Is that a problem?" He added matter-of-factly,"Everyone knows I've been a fan of hers since her first live performance."

He gave an exaggerated look of surprise. "Or haven't I made that obvious enough?"

Then, with a dramatic roll of his eyes, he turned and left to join his siblings to get some food.

Brandon and Vivian were left standing in silence.

Meanwhile, in the car, Jayceon turned to Myron, seeking approval. "How was l?"

Myron smiled."Not bad."

"Then give me less work this month. I'm exhausted," Jayceon pleaded.

Myron simply gave him a quiet smile that sent a chill down his spine.

"Alright, alright..." Jayceon raised his hands in surrender. "But seriously, why don't you do this yourself? You always use me as your front."

As the car sped down the street, Myron finally replied, "She hasn't agreed to be with me yet. I have to respect her wishes. If I made my feelings for her public now, it might only pressure her."

Respecting boundaries was the key,

Using Jayceon's public fandom as cover gave Millie space. At least she wouldn't push him away. She had always prioritized her career, after all.

"Oh..." Jayceon mumbled, half-understanding.

---

Meanwhile, Millie and the others had returned to the lounge.

Their group chat was buzzing.

Led by Seville, they were launching a full-blowr counterattack online.
Earlier, there had been doubts. People suspected Serena and Millie might have been colluding somehow.But after Millie's jaw-dropping performance after she removed the plaster mask, all the speculation vanished.

Serena was Millie. No doubt remained.

Then the conversation shifted to the donation fraud scandal.

Millie had nothing to do with any fraudulent donations, but a new theory emerged-
      
Since Brandon's donation involved marital assets, did that mean Vivian had contributed nothing at all?
###Chapter 148 No Longer A Couple


Once the speculation began, everyone suddenly realized something wasn't quite right.

"Oh, that's right. Millie is Brandon's wife. So at that auction... what was Vivian doing there?"

"From what I heard, Vivian wasn't even on the guest list. She went wvith Brandon as his date."

"I remember that going viral. Brandon rarely attends those social events, and when he does, it's always with Millie. But that time, it was Vivian. And people simply couldn't stop talking about it. Yeah, she definitely went as Brandon's plus-one."

"What about Serena? Did she go with Charles, or was she there on her own?"

"That's where it gets interesting. Apparently, Serena had her own bidding number, which only came with an invitation card. When the donation fraud accusations surfaced, it was mentioned that there were no records under her name and number. So yes, Serena was invited independently."

The speculation sparked a wave of renewed interest online.

People began rewatching old clips, reanalyzing reports.

"Something's off. Vivian didn't just tag along, she basically wore a bridal gown. What was that supposed to mean? Was she trying to send a message?"

The dress, with its unmistakable bridal silhouette, had indeed been the center of attention that night.

"Didn't Vivian once say she'd never be the other woman? What does this dress say, then? Millie is Brandon's legal wife and she's still in the picture."

···

The narrative online shifted. Millie, once condemned for tolerating her husband's affairs in exchange for a luxurious life, was now seen in a different light. The criticism turned toward Vivian-for knowingly staying close to Brandon despite his marriage.

"Aren't we live-streaming? Vivian, answer us! Weren't you just sketching your own funeral invitation card?That means you're watching. Say something!"

The comment exploded in popularity, piling intense pressure on Vivian.

She was no longer visible on the stream.

Previously caught on hidden camera, she now dared not speak freely backstage

She sat inside her car, accompanied only by her caregiver.

"Miss Simpson, what should we do now?" The caregiver's voice trembled. "There's no way to explain this.
Who would've guessed Serena was Millie? Everything's falling apart..."

Vivian's face contorted with frustration. She shot the caregiver a harsh look, silencing her instantly.

Meanwhile, in the recording studio, contestants eliminated from previous rounds were being brought onstage again as guest performers. Their voices drifted faintly in the distance.

Vivian pulled out her phone and called Johnny.

He picked up right away, clearly in a panic.

"Miss Simpson, what now?" Johnny's voice cracked. They might have a bunch of backup plans, but none of them accounted for Serena being Millie.

They had assumed Serena was finished and had been preparing to exploit the situation, stoking public anger against her.

Now, they were out of moves.

"There's still time," Vivian said, forcing herself to stay composed. "As long as the livestream's running, I can claim I haven't seen the online backlash yet."

"But things are moving fast. Millie's team already has professionals pushing the fact that you didn't spend a dime at the charity auction," Johnny warned.
Vivian closed her eyes, her mind racing. Then, slowly, she turned to glance at Brandon's direction.

.

Elsewhere backstage, Brandon stood near Millie's lounge, waiting for her to come out.

He needed to speak to her.

His thoughts circled back to everything he'd learned about Serena lately.

Jayceon's words echoed-"Serena's condition on the earlier broadcasts? Anyone with eyes could telt.

And it was true. Brandon had seen it. He'd even blamed Charles for letting her work despite those obvious injuries.

Now,looking back...he understood the truth.

HHe remembered what happened a few days ago at Crobert Hospital.

That morning, he had recovered and was being discharged.

While his assistant handled the paperwork, he thought back to Giffard's words.

He decided to check on Millie's records.

He went to the nurses' station and asked to see her medical file.

"And your relationship to her?" the nurse asked, typing.

He almost said he was her husband before he remembered they were about to divorce.

"I'm a friend," he said instead.

The nurse gave him a pointed look. "A friend? She was hospitalized for days, and you didn't visit? Can't you ask her yourself? If you're not her family, I can't share patient information."

He had no answer.

Now,thinking back... Brandon closed his eyes, his emotions in turmoil. Everything was unraveling.

Why had Millie hidden that she was Serena?

Her recent behavior and her growing distance all pointed to something deeper, something shifting between them.

But he couldn't make sense of it. And worse, he couldn't fix it.

A dull ache settled in his chest, leaving him lost.

His phone buzzed.

It was a call from his grandfather, Derek.

As he hesitated, debating whether to pick up, he noticed Vivian nearby.

"Brandon," she called softly, her voice shaky, eyes red and filled with tears.

"What should I do?" she cried, the tears falling freely now. "I didn't know Serena was her.I keep thinking about those past episodes.I feel so guilty."

She sobbed harder.

"You know I never meant to hurt her. But now... Brandon, tell me... what can I do to make things right?"⑦

He looked at her, uncertain how to respond.

His phone buzzed again.

Vivian's eyes followed the vibration.

Staring at the phone, she kept crying. "Are you going to choose her over me? Brandon, are you really going to leave me behind?"

Back in Millie's lounge, Millie opened a link popped up in their group chat that showed a new narrative circulating online right now.

"It's all about intent. Vivian went to that charity gala to raise awareness for sick children. Millie only went to compete with her."
###Chapter 149 The Owner Of The Tanzanite


Millie immediately understood what was happening. Vivian was fighting back. They were trying to distract the public.

Suddenly, a wave of online marketing flooded in. The narrative shifted. "Brandon just brought Vivian along.They never officially said they were together, Didn't Millie show up with Charles? So what does that make Millie and Charles?"

"At the auction, Vivian made the first bid on the tanzanite. She used Brandon's card because she didn't have her own. it was clearly her choice. Later, Millie kept bidding to drive the price up just to get to her."

"More importantly, Vivian didn't know Serena was Millie. She just wanted to donate a few million to charity.Millie, on the other hand, knew everything and still kept raising the stakes."

"Exactly,VVivian didn't have her own number card. You can't blame her for that."


···

Online, both sides continued arguing. The comments were relentless.

People stuck to their opinions, but some started to waver.

The focus gradually shifted from Vivian's dress issue and replaced by speculation about everyone's intentions when the bidding war started.

In the lounge, Charles frowned with disgust.

Realizing he was still on camera, he turned away and typed behind his phone."I've never seen someone so shameless. If she were Qakley, I'd have beaten her already."

Millie glanced over and chuckled.

She began typing. "She's walking straight into ler own downfall."
Charles looked at her, suddenly remembering something. There was a hint of eagerness in his eyes.

"Remember what we talked about when this first started?" Millie asked with a calm voice.

Charles nodded.

He hadn't forgotten.

When Serena's donation fraud scandal broke out, they had chosen not to respond right away, mostly because Millie and Brandon hadn't finalized their divorce yet. The original plan was to stay patient,and as soon as the divorce wwent through, they could speak out.

But with Watson Group and Elliott Group stepping in, they decided to hold back and wait for the finals.They wanted to release undeniable proof.

Despite the minor adjustment, the plan was already in place.

Step one was to reveal Serena's reaI identity. That would instantly discredit the donation fraud story.

Then,step two-

"The truth will come out," Millie murmured. She kept typing. "The tanzanite is mine. I donated it for charity.That's a fact."

Just then, her phone buzzed with a message. "Here's the archive of your tanzanite purchase." There was a document attached.

It was from Myron.

Millie raised her eyebrows, paused, and replied. "Thank you."

Myron texted back right away. "Just doing my job. No thanks needed."

With this archive, and the records she had already shared with Charles, their case was solid.

Millie forwarded all the documents to their group chat, and then exchanged a look with Charles.

Now they only needed to choose the right time to strike.
Letting things brew a little longer would maximize the effect.

This was Seville'sspecialty, so Millie had nothing to worry.

Upon seeing the documents Millie sent, Seville let out a laugh. He was already giving instructions to his team.

Elsewhere, Vivian reappeared on the live stream and took her seat.

She looked like she had just finished crying. Her eyes were red. Her expression was heavy, like she was holding something back.

Ten minutes earlier, she had been crying in front of Brandon. She had also ordered Johnny to manage the team and launch a-counterattack.

She had asked Brandon several questions. He hadn't answered any of them.

He only wiped her tears and said, "I'll talk to her."

It sounded like the same vague reply as before. But something felt different.

Because when she tried to use Watson Group's resources to clear her name later, Eugene refused. She didn't dare push further.

She had seen it clearly. Brandon's hesitation. His sorrow when he found out Serena was Millie.

She had wanted to say more. But then he picked up a call from Derek.

Vivian stayed quiet after that.

Meanwhile,Brandon had already left the venue.

Now, he sat in the back of a Bentley, staring out the window.

Eugene drove in silence,heading toward Moonlit Estate.

Brandon watched the scenery flash by. His chest felt tight. His thoughts were scattered.

Ten minutes earlier, he had finally taken his grafdfather's call.
"Come back here right now!" Derek had shouted.

Derek already knew what had happened between Brandon and Millie. But he no longer expected Brandon to fix it.

Everyone knew Brandon had attended the show with Vivian.

So Derek had given a direct order. He told Brandon to return home at once.

The scenery rushed past the window. Brandon's thoughts were in chaos.

From the front seat, Eugene glanced at his boss through the rearview mirror. The air inside the car felt stifling.

"So Serena is really Mrs. Watson," Eugene thought. "How's this going to end now?" But he kept this to himself.He didn't dare say a word out loud. He just kept driving.

Soon,they reached Moonlit Estate.

As soon as Brandon stepped inside, he heard Derek's voice. "On your knees."

Brandon said nothing. He lowered his head and knelt in front of Derek's wheelchair.

Derek's face was full of rage. He hit Brandon with his cane. "You've really messed things up! I had no interest in watching that show, but I tuned in for Millie. And look at what I saw. How do you expect to face her? I've told you over and over to stay away from that Vivian woman. You never listened.You said you had your reasons. Tell me, do those reasons make Millie forgive you?"

With every sentence, the cane struck harder.

Brandon didn't flinch. His eyes were full of pain.

He had no idea what to say,

He couldn't answer Vivian's questions. He didn't know how Millie felt. He had no way to explain himself to his grandfather.

"Speak!" Derek demanded.
But Brandon remained silent.

Then, his phone began to buzz.

He pulled it out. Eugene was calling.

Eugene wouldn't call now unless it was urgent.

Under Derek's glare, Brandon answered. "Mr. Watson,"Eugene said. "Something's happened. Just now,online news confirmed that the owner of the tanzanite from the charity auction... is Mrs. Watson."

###Chapter 150 The Truth About The Tanzanite


"The full details are online. You can check it out-l've sent the link," Eugene said calmly.

Derek, on the other hand, still looked furious and struck Brandon with his cane a few more times.

But Brandon didn't react. It was as if he felt no pain at all. He simply ended the call and opened the link Eugene had sent.


···

Just ten minutes earlier, a rumor had begun picking up momentum-Vivian had joinedthe charity gala to support sick children, while Millie had shown up only to make trouble.

Vivian's PR team, led by Johnny, was fanning the flames.

They started by pushing the narrative about the tanzanite's mediocre value.

"The tanzanite was valued simply around one million. Usually, it wouldn't go beyond 1.2 million, even in an charity auction. Vivian made a reasonable bid. But Millie kept raising it, forcing the price up."

"Exactly. If Millie really wanted it, she would've started bidding from the start. It's obvious se only did it because Vivian wanted it."

"Vivian's goal was to raise awareness for children in need. Millie? She just wanted to ruin it."


.··

Millie had made no response so far. And to Vivian, that silence was victory.

Once, people had called Vivian the real fraud, but now, her team had turned the story around. "She wanted to do charity work, and she did. It was Millie who kept pushing. Vivian had no choice but to give up."

Now, the blame sat squarely on Millie's shoulders.

Everyone in the lounge was stunned.
"Vivian's team really knows how to spin a story. I wonder where she found people like that," Barbara said.

Charles nodded. "I still remember that one post boasting about her kindness and everything. That one really worked.People ate it up."

Millie also nodded.

She had always known how good Vivian's PR team was at shaping the narrative.

And sadly, she'd been one of their targets.

After a moment's thought, Millie said, "We're ready. Let's begin."

Charles nodded and sent a message to Seville and the others in the group chat.

Then, out of nowhere, two statements appeared online.

The first was posted by Evans Entertainment's official account.

It read, "First, identity confirmation-Serena is Millie. This arrangement is backed by a confidentiality agreement. Second, because of that same agreement, Millie's identity had to be kept secret during the auction. Third, the originaI owner and donor of the tanzanite at the charity auction was Millie, though this was hidden due to the first two reasons."

Evidence was attached.

The second post came from Millie's personal account. It included her purchase receipt for the tanzanite and official documentation from Elliott Group's archive.

Elliott Group reposted it, confirming it was genuine.

The Internet exploded.

Back at Moonlit Estate, Brandon read through everything in stunned silence.

Everyone now knew the truth-the tanzanite belonged to Millie. But only he knew what that really meant.

It was the birthstone she'd picked out for their êhild.
He remembered the first time they saw it together. Her voice still echoed in his mind."Tanzanite represents love and eternity. Turquoise is supposed to bring victory and success. If I had to choose, I'd go with tanzanite. Because I'd want to tell our child their parents wvill always love them."

His hands shook as he gripped the phone.

And yet, that day at the auction, he had publicly outbid her with 25 million and snatched the stone from her right in front of everyone-all for Vivian's sake.

Millie must have thought he'd given the tanzanite to Vivian.

The image of that deep blue gem-now locked away in his condo safe-flashed through his mind.

Its glow felt like a stab to his heart.

The air around himn seemed to vanish. His chest tightened.

"What the hell is going on now? Is Vivian stirring up trouble again?" Derek snapped.

But Brandon just shook his head.

Without a word, he stood and walked out.

"Where do you think you're going?" Derek shouted.

Brandon didn't answer.

Derek hurled his cane. It hit Brandon hard in the leg.

He stumbled but kept walking.

Meanwhile, Seville and his team were still fueling the fire.

"So that's it. Millie donated the tanzanite to charity. Everything went downhill just because the person who bid on it turned out to be her husband's lover."

"Who could take that lying down?"

"Right? Vivian was clinging to Brandon, dressed like a bride, and still had the nerve to bid on Millie's tanzanite!"

"Put yourself in Millie's shoes-you'd lose it too!"

"That's why she kept raising the bid. Now it all makes sense."

"So Vivian's the other woman!"

"And now they're blaming Millie for everything? What a joke!"

"And Brandon? He's completely lost it."

"If it were me, I'd drag those two cheaters out and confront them myself!"

"Vivian, speak up! You're nothing but a shameless home-wrecker. Own up and apologize!"

"Apologize,Vivian!"

In a flash, public opinion flipped again.

Vivian, who'd been basking in glory just minutes ago, now looked pale. She gripped her phone tightly,staring at Brandon's contact-but didn't press call.

Back at Moonlit Estate, Brandon had returned his own villa.

Outside the house, he paused. He remembered how Milie had slapped him there. Her eyes. Her tears.

He walked back into the villa, recalling the kiss they shared at the entryway.

He entered the same bedroom from that night. The moonlight looked just like before.

The room was quiet. Still.

He stared at the bed, almost seeing the tracks of her tears on the pillow.

And in the corner was the button that had popped off when he'd torn her shirt.

Her scent still lingered. But now, she was gone.
The silence echoed her words from that rooftop moment during the auction break.

"Mr. Watson, you shouldn't let your concern reach past your partner, or else you'll only end up betraying her."

That day, Serena had smiled at him. But Millie-Millie was crying inside.
###Chapter 151 Pain


Online discussion was intensifying.

At that moment, Elliott Group released a video.

It captured the scene from the tanzanite auction at the jewelry house. This was when Millie purchased the tanzanite from Elliott Group.

In the video, everyone's face was blurred except hers.

Millie had been seated alone in a corner, silently raising her paddle again and again.

Across the room, a man taunted her. "If you were anyone else, I'd let it go. It's just a stone. But since you're Brandon's wife, there's no way I'm giving it to you."

Millie looked at him calmly. "What would it take for you to let me have it?"

The man let out a loud laugh, eyes locked on her. "Right here, in front of everyone-say you're a bitch,call Brandon worthless, and agree to collaborate with me. Only then will I back down."

Millie stood without hesitation, still smiling.

Everyone thought she might comply. Instead, she picked up a paddle and struck him across the face.

"Fuck you!" The man reeled back, furious, about to charge at her. Millie didn't even flinch.

"I'll sue you! That's assault!"

She gave him a faint smile. "Go ahead. The paddle's so light, the mark will fade before you reach the door.Think you can prove anything?"

“Millie!"

"And you're right. I am humiliating you," she said, her tone even. "I won't let you insult Brandon. Not under any circumstances." Her voice was calm, but her eyes were cold. "Do you understand?"
The man shouted, "Aren't you afraid you'll lose the stone?"

Millie didn't answer right away. She just smiled, her composure sharpening the contrast with his rage.

"Try me," she said. "Do you really think you can scare me or go up against the Watsons?"

Silence spread across the room.

The man froze, caught between advancing and retreating.

Then Millie spoke again. "Looks like I the paddle cut you a bit. Maybe go clean up?"

He latched onto the out she offered.

Muttering threats under his breath, he turned toward the exit.

But as he reached the door, he paused and looked back. "You fight so hard for Brandon. You do everything for him. But what if one day he leaves you? That will leave you the laughingstock of all of Crobert!"

Milie didn't look at him. She turned to the rest of the room. "Anyone else want to bid?"

No one answered.

The man let out a final snort. "You'll regret this!"

But Millie said nothing back. She just won the tanzanite without issue.

Because of his repeated bids, the price had risen higher than expected.

The video then showed her receiving the gem later with a gentle smile.

Someone nearby asked, "You look so happy, Mrs. Watson. Is there something special about this tanzanite?"

Millie gazed down at the deep blue stone, smiling softly. "If we have a child, this would make a beautiful piece of jewelry for them. I think Brandon would love it too."

This video went viral online.

Millie was rarely seen on public after she marfied Brandon. Most of the time, she came across as distant more like a background figure next to Brandon than someone real.

It was rare to see her so alive.

This video changed that. It revealed her strength, her decisiveness, and her deep loyalty to Brandon.

"She looked so gentle and happy, talking about the tanzanite, her future child, and her husband. So why did she end up selling it?"

"Why? Isn't it obvious? Are you really that naive?"

--·

The debate online continued to rage.

At the Moonlit Estate, Brandon could no longer stay on his feet. He sank to the floor and watched the video in silence.

He remembered the moment she had smiled at him and gently placed his hand on her bely. "I'll take good care of my health," she had said. "We can have another child in the future."

The child they had lost in Flesta was a wound that never closed.

They never spoke of those days.

That pain lingered, too deep to revisit. He had buried himself in her embrace, chasing the hope of creating something new.

It became his obsession.

Yet he had even competed with her for the very birthstone she had chosen for their future child.

They hadn't had a child yet. But the tanzanite had meant something more.

What had she been thinking as she bid against him? Did it hurt her to see Vivian sitting beside him as he raised his paddle over and over?

Brandon lowered his head. A single tear slid dovn his cheek.
What else had he missed? What more had he really done to hurt her?

-.·

Meanwhile, public opinion online was overwhelmingly in Millie's favor.

At the same time, the final live broadcast of Heavenly Melody came to a close.

The host announced the winners on stage.

Serena-Millie-was declared the champion without contest.

As she accepted the trophy, dazzling lights lit up the stage around her.

She stood in a wash of gold and silver, confetti raining down.

The applause was deafening, Online, the comment section overflowed with congratulations.

Crowds chanted her name.

Once offstage, Millie finally allowed herself to relax.

"The competition is finally over," she said with a smle to Barbara beside her.

Barbara grinned. "The sponsor reps are all here. Time to sign some contracts!"

Each sponsor had promised resources for the champion. Now that the competition had ended, they would begin to fulfill their commitments.

Barbara grew more excited by the second.

Charles nodded in agreement.

They all headed backstage. The representatives were already seated, including those from Elliott Group.Jayceon and Adriana had left for dinner, so only Myron remained at the table.

When Millie and the others entered, Myron stood and offered his hand. "Congratulations on winning."

Millie smiled and shook his hand. "Thank you, lfook forward to working together with the Elliott Group."
°As do I," Myron said with a polite smile. "Let's make this a great partnershíp."

There were no objections. The lawyers had reviewed the contracts beforehand, so everything was ready.

Millie signed her name. Each party received a copy.

The reps all nodded in approval.

Daphne, though visibly displeased, said nothing.

She had already decided to stay quiet after learning Serena was actually Millie.

Still, she was the runner-up and would receive some support. That was her only consolation.

The third-place contestant had never expected to rank so high. They accepted their modest share of resourcés with good cheer.

Only Vivian looked truly shaken.

Outside the venue, a large crowd had gathered. They had originally come to protest Serena staying in the show. Now, the atmosphere had shifted entirely. Vivian hesitated to step outside. She wasn't sure what might be waiting for her there.
###Chapter 152 Stop Playing The Victim


No one paid much attention to Vivian. Everyone else seemed genuinely happy. Most of the crowd had gathered around Millie.

The sponsor reps and contestants all chatted warmly. Since they worked in the same industry, there was a chance they'd collaborate someday.

Before Serena revealed her true identity, there had been a private discussion among these reps.

Earlier,before the final round-when Serena was under fire-a meeting had been held at the Evans family's estate. Representatives from both the Watson Group and the Elliott Group had come to support her, leaving the others confused.

Back then, they didn't know everything. But now, the truth had come to light.

Serena was Millie all along, which was probably why both the Watson Group and the Elliott Group stood up for her.

One of the business partners turned to Myron and asked, "Mr. Elliott, at the Evans estate that day, did you let your brother go and show support of Serena because you already knew her true identity?"

Myron smiled but gave no direct answer.

He simply said, "The Elliott Group values Serena for her talent, her potential, and the returns she brings."

The man nodded, understanding at once.

They were all businesspeople. Even if Serena was really Millie, she remained Brandon's wife, and that had little to do with Elliott Group.

At most, it was just about Jayceon being a fan. But what truly mattered was Serena's talent.

Everyone accepted that and moved on to mingle with others.
Soon, guests began leaving one by one.

Outside, a huge crowd had formed. Many were fans of the contestants, but even more had come hoping to see Millie and Vivian.

The media wasn't far behind.

With both Brandon's wife and his rumored mistress appearing on the same show, it was a media goldmine.

Given the online buzz, every outlet wanted to jump on the story.

So,the moment Millie stepped out, people rushed toward her like a tidal wave.

Microphones filled the air as reporters fired questions.

"Why did you wear a mask during the competition?"

"What did you think when you found out Vivian was a judge?"

"Now that you've won, what are your plans going forward?"

Flashbulbs from their cameras lit up the night like fireworks.

Charles' security team quickly surrounded Millie, carving out a space for her.

Millie, calm and composed, answered a few questions. She avoided anything about Vivian.

She said with a smile, "The mask was a decision made together with Evans Entertainment."

She added, "Winning Heavenly Melody was only possible because of the love and support from everyone-those here and those watching from home. Thank you all so much."

Then she bowed deeply before the crowd.

"As for what comes next, I'll discuss my future plans with Evans Entertainment. I hope you'll all keep supporting me."

After that, she ignored every question about Vivian or Brandon and headed straight for the SUV, protected by the guards.
Just before the vehicle pulled away, a loud voice rang out. "Vivian's out! Surround her!"

Millie watched as the crowd swerved toward Vivian.

Barbara's face lit up with glee.

"She's been attacking us online for weeks. Let's see how she handles the heat now!" she said, clearly enjoying the moment.

But Millie wasn't so sure it would be that easy.

Vivian was a pro at managing her image. How she'd spin this mess was yet to be seen.

In the crowd surrounding Vivian, angry voices began to rise. "How can you destroy someone's marriage and bully the wife? You're disgusting!"

"That's right! Answer us! You're not walking away this time!"

"Speak up! Apologize, Vivian!"

The more polished Vivian's public image had been, the harsher the backlash now.

Many who once supported her now felt deeply betrayed. Their anger ran deeper than that of her critics.

Sure, Vivian still had loyal fans online who believed she was innocent. But none of them were there tonight.

The ones who showed up had come to vent their rage.

"This is just too satisfying!" Barbara laughed, pumping her fist. "She had it coming!"

The SUV dipped slightly as Charles climbed in.

Barbara kept peeking out the window, watching the chaos unfold.

Millie found this a little amusing.

"Close the door. If we linger too long, it'll get too crowded," she said.

Barbara hesitated but finally shut the door after one last look.

The SUV rolled forward.

Just before they turned the corner, Millie glanced back at the crowd still swarming Vivian.

Charles noticed. "What's wrong?" he asked.

Millie shook her head, "Just curious how she'll handle this."

Charles let out a loud laugh.

"Forget her. Let's go celebrate. We've earned it!"

"Sounds good," Millie replied. But this time, she wasn't going to the Blue Lounge.

She had no intention of bumping into Darden or Brandon again and getting dragged into another scene.

Now that the dust had settled with the show, she could finally focus on new projects-the Bennett famnily lawsuits, and Ari's health.

Ari's surgery application had already been submitted. The operation could be scheduled any day.

Just thinking of Ari's chubby little face brought a soft smile to Millie's lips.

Laughter filled the car as they headed to the celebration. Meanwhile, outside the Heavenly Melody recording venue, Vivian faced the angry crowd alone.

Many who felt betrayed pointed fingers and shouted harsh words.

Reporters shoved microphones at her, refusing to back off.

"There are claims you got involved in Brandon and Millie's marriage. What do you say?"

"Did you target Serena-who's actually Millie-on purpose?"

"What exactly is yourrelationship with Brandon? Did you interfere in his marriage?"

Each question was sharper than the last.

Vivian wanted to leave, but the crowd hemmed her in.
Inside, she burned with frustration. But on the outside, she looked delicate, eyes turning red as she whispered, "I didn't know Serena was Millie."

Tears rolled down her cheeks, making her look helpless. "And I'm not a home-wrecker," she added.

But someone in the crowd yelled, "We're not Brandon! Save your tears! Stop playing the victimn!"
###Chapter 153 Strong Backlash


Vivian pressed her lips together and wiped her cheeks, though the redness in her eyes remained.

"I never lied to anyone," she said quietly. "I wasn't a home-wrecker, and I'm not trying to paint myself as a victim. I just... honestly didn't know Serena and Millie were the same person."

Her tears came again. She tried to stop them, but they kept flowing.

"I joined this show to inspire those battling illness. That's it. You may think I wronged her, but I didn't understand the situation. I was clueless. I didn't even know she was in the competition. I had no idea Millie was the one bidding against me for the tanzanite at the auction. And I certainly didn't know that gem was hers-"

A loud splatter cut her off as a water balloon hit the ground near her feet, bursting and soaking her shoes.

"Just answer us! Did you or didn't you wreck someone's marriage?"

Chaos erupted instantly. Shouts rang out from every direction.

At first, many had believed Vivian-believed she'd spoken up for the sick, believed she wasn't the other woman in Brandon and Millie's marriage. She had their sympathy. Their support.

But now the truth was unraveling.

Millie, Brandon's legal wife, had joined the show in disguise. She'd been under fire the entire time,while Brandon was seen frequently with Vivian, fueling endless speculation.

Online posts had smeared Millie's name since day one. And it was likely Vivian had a hand in them.

People who once stood behind Vivian, who had mocked Millie in her defense, now realized they'd been manipulated.

They wanted answers.
"I did not!" Vivian shouted, her voice cracking. "Believe me or not, I didn't do it! If you despise me that much, then fine! I'll never speak anything online again!"

But the crowd wasn't listening. They were too riled up to care.

Moments later, Vivian dropped to the ground in a feigned faint.

The uproar only worsened, forcing the Heavenly Melody crew to send security to take control of the situation.

Vivian was swiftly taken back to her SUV.

The moment the door shut and the others walked off, she snapped her eyes open.

Seething,she shoved everything off the seat beside her in one violent sweep.

"That witch Millie!" she snarled, her voice thick with fury.

Her phone buzzed. Johnny again. Gritting her teeth, Vivian forced herself to breathe evenly before picking up the call.

...

Even after Heavenly Melody wrapped up, the noise refused to die down. In fact, the buzz grew louder online.

Interviews with contestants after the finals circulated everywhere, many centered on the dramatic finale-Vivian fainting mid-chaos.

Some participants even jumped on livestreams, eager to ride the wave of attention.

But most of the spotlight had shifted. All eyes were now on Serena's performance.

Countless influencers dissected her every gesture, lyric, and expression.

"Her stage presence was unreal. No one's going to top that for years."

During the live broadcast, no one had realized Serena and Millie were the same person. Most viewers were still too caught up in the protests to notice.

Now, watching the performance again with fresh eyes, it felt completely transformed.

Her song wasn't just a performance, it was a reflection of how the public viewed her, shifting in real time.

She had accurately anticipated each action and response, even the way the Internet would react.

And she rose through it, crafting a new identity right under the Internet's watchful gaze.

Reproducing something like that? Impossible. It wasn't just good. Itwas unforgettable.

"Now that we know Serena is Millie, let's walk through her five songs again."

"'Yesterday,' 'Us,' 'Deep Sea,' 'Journey,' and 'Sculpture.'"

"Each one hit so hard. I used to wonder what she must have been through to write songs like that. Now I get it.She is Millie."

"Imagine standing on that stage, pouring your heart out, while Vivian judged you and Brandon sat in the crowd...for Vivian."

"From every note,you can tell she loved him. You can hear the pain."

"Stop. I'm getting emotional..."

"I've had enough. I'm going to drag Vivian."

Across social platforms, influencers, fans, and onlookers lit up the Internet with reactions.

Seville, now representing Evans Entertainment, stepped in to clear the air regarding Millie's identity,but made no move to fan the flames against Vivian.

Still, some netizens, feeling manipulated and embarrassed, headed straight to Vivian's page to stir up trouble on their own.

It was probably the backlash Vivian never expected.

The more carefully built the image, the harder it shattered.
While the drama unfolded online, Millie and her friends were busy enjoying their victory banquet.Vivian wasn't even a passing thought.

"This time, we booked a private room. No chance of Brandon crashing it again!" Charles announced proudly.

He hadn't forgotten the last time they'd tried to toast Millie's singlehood.

Tonight,though, the mood was light. Spirits were high.

"To your win!" Charles raised his glass first, his expression full of admiration.

Now that she was officially done with Brandon, maybe his window had finally opened.

He'd even been working on keeping his temper in check lately.

Still, Charles didn't rush. He glanced at Millie's smiling face, and then looked away. If things didn't work out,he didn't want to lose her as a friend either.

"Congratulations, Millie!" the others joined in, raising their glasses with genuine warmth.

Millie stood.

She had changed out of her stage clothes and removed all her makeup.

With a small smile, she lifted her glass and emptied it in one go.

"This past month has been the hardest period of my lishe said, her eyes welling up with tears.

Though she wasn't one for dramatic speeches, her emotion was real at the moment.

"I'm thankful to every single one of you, for sticking by me, for lifting me up when I couldn't do it myself.
This victory belongs to all of us."

Millie smiled again, quietly remembering the loneliness that had once almost crushed her.

Thankfully,she wasn't alone this time.

The worst had passed. A new ###Chapter had begén.
Everyone nodded, and Alexia rushed forward to pull her into a hug.

The road had been brutal.

Every eyes present teared up.

"Enough crying. Let's eat and drink and celebrate properly," Millie said, wiping her face with the back of her hand. "From here on out, all I want is to be happy."

"Exactly!" Alexia grinned. "And if we're happy, someone else is definitely miserable tonight."

"You're totally giving off villain vibes right now, haha!"

"Maybe I'm just trying the role on for size."

Their laughter filled the room.

Outside, someone passed by the private dining area and leaned over to whisper something to a companion with a smile.

A few seconds later, someone knocked on the door.

A server came in, wheeling in a cart. "Mr. Myron Elliott heard you were celebrating here," the server said politely. "He sent over one of our finest-Victory's Dawn."

Meanwhile, at Vivian's place, she stared at her screen in disbelief, those same netizens she'd once instructed Johnny to unleash on Millie were now turning on her. Her expression contorted with fury.
###Chapter 154 Let's Just End This Now


The group accepted the wine, and Charles asked the server to thank Myron for them.

"Mr. Elliott is really kind," Alexia said, glancing at the expensive wine.

Charles chuckled, though he wasn't sure why exactly Myron had sent the wine-he really didn't have to.

"Maybe my charm is just too much to resist," he replied after a moment.

Millie acknowledged the wine with a quick glance but said nothing.

The others had already opened the bottle, and the room was full of laughter.

Meanwhile, at the Moonlit Estate, in a dimly lit room, Brandon's phone buzzed violently on the floor

He slowly raised his head, hesitated, and then tapped the screen to answer.

"What is it?" His voice was tired.

"Mr. Watson, something's wrong. It's Miss Simpson..." the caregiver said, voice shaking.

The Aston Martin tore through the streets.

Brandon drove straight to Vivian's apartment, his lips pressed into a tight line.

He hurried upstairs.

The caregiver opened the door in a panic, speaking quickly as she led him inside. "She's been in the bathroom for nearly half an hour. She won't open the door no matter how much I knock. I checked-one of the fruit knives is missing."

Brandon followed her to the bathroom.

"Vivian," he called, knocking on the door.
No answer.

"Open the door." He knocked again, louder.

Still nothing.

He stepped back a little and then kicked the door open.

It crashed inward. Vivian lay in the bathtub, her wrist bleeding.

"Miss Simpson!" the caregiver cried.

"Don't come near me!" Vivian shouted, clearly startled.

She still had the knife in her hand, and her expression was wild. The caregiver froze, unsure what to do.

"Why are you here, Brandon?" Vivian sobbed.

Without speaking, he walked over, took the knife from her hand, and tossed it aside.

"Call emergency services," he told the caregiver.

She nodded and ran out immediately.

Vivian struggled. "Why won't you just let meidie? If everyone already thinks I'm hurting her, then why stop me? Wouldn't it be easier for everyone if I just disappeared?"

"Vivian," Brandon said, trying to calm her.

She cried harder.

"You never loved me!" she screamed. "I knew it the moment you left today. Everything that happened-l begged for it. None of it came from you willingly!"

She wept as she went on. "I was the one who asked you to stay. I changed how my name was saved in your phone. I was the one who told you to divorce her. I asked you to go everywhere with me. I made you say you loved me."

Tears poured down her face. She watched him closely, searching his expression. "You never touched me...
Even after the divorce, you wouldn't marry me. The way you look at her... it's never the way you look at me..."

Brandon kept his head down, silent.

Seeing he still hadn't said a word, Vivian frowned and tried to move her arms, as if to make the bleeding worse.

She cried out again, breathless, "You only stayed because I am dying. Brandon... if you can't keep pretending to care, then let's just end this now."

She broke down completely. Still, Brandon didn't say a word. He just held her wrist, trying to stop the bleeding.

Upon meeting only his silence, a flicker of resentment flashed in Vivian's eyes-but she quickly hid it.

She kept crying. "I'm already living on borrowed time. So what if I go a little earlier? If you love her, then go.Just leave me alone."

She looked pale and fragile, her tears mixing with the blood.

"Don't say things like that." That was all Brandon said.

His head stayed low, his expression unreadable.

Vivian finally smiled.

When the ambulance arrived, she closed her eyes and "fainted".

Before long, a sensational hashtag surged to the top of the trending list: #VivianAttemptsSuicide

The accompanying video showed Brandon carrying a blood-soaked Vivian out of her apartment building. An ambulance waited at the curb.

In the background, Vivian's voice could be heard crying out, "Why save me? I'm already living on borrowed time. I don't know how to explain myself. Wouldn't it be better if I just ended it all?"

She was pale, trembling, her wrist covered in blood.
The Internet exploded.

Johnny seized the opportunity.

"My God, are they actually driving Vivian to her death?"

"I knew this would happen!"

"She only had a few months to live, and they pushed her this far. No wonder she broke down."

"Exactly. Those rumors, don't hold up. Vivian didn't know Serena was Millie. She joined that music show to inspire others suffering from illness."

＂She was consistent， I＇ll give her that. She only has a few months to live， so why would she target Millie？＂金

"And there's no official statement saying she and Brandon were an item. People just assumed things."

Netizens, unwilling to be seen as bullies, began to backpedal.

Many still supported Vivian, or at least hadn't made up their minds.

Under Johnny's direction, his team swiftly reversed the negative narrative.

Soon, the conversation shifted to the dangers of online bullying.

···

Meanwhile, at the Moonlit Estate, Derek and Norma had seen the news too.

"Earlier, he looked so distressed when he rushed out. I thought he had gone after Millie. I didn't expect this,"Derek said angrily.

"Matthew, get the car," he ordered the butler. "I'm going to find him. He needs to know something.Whether that woman lives or dies has nothing to do with him. The only woman who matters to him is his wife."



Eventually, Millie saw the news as well.
She wasn't too concerned. Her focus from the beginning was always on winning Heavenly Melody, gaining exposure, and reclaiming the Bennett family's business from the Watson Group.

Her recent PR battle had been one of defense, not attack. She had never meant to drive Vivian to the edge.But the situation kept pulling her back in.

Fortunately, now that people were reflecting on online bullying, they had stopped dragging her into it.

Vivian would need time to recover and probably wouldn't return to the public eye anytime soon.

Meanwhile, another celébrity scandal had just broken, drawing attention away from the situation.

The storm was finally calming.

She could finally take a breather.

Her phone suddenly buzzed. It was a message from Derek."Don't worry, Millie. I'll make sure you get the justice you deserve."

Millie frowned slightly.

Had Brandon still not told the Watson family about their divorce?
###Chapter 155 We Are Divorced


Across town at Crobert Hospital, Vivian was getting her wounds tended to, while Brandon waited alone in the hallway.

The fluorescent lights overhead painted everything in a cold, sterile glow.

He slouched back in his seat, eyes fixed on the blank ceiling.

Everything that had happened today spun through his mind in a storm, too much, too fast.

Thoughts of Millie wouldn't leave him alone. Every memory they'd made replayed in his head, from their years together to these strange, painful days when she'd shown up as Serena.

He kept seeing her tears, those haunted eyes that squeezed his heart. But all of it faded against the image of Vivian's wrist, bloodied and bandaged.

That was on him.

A storm of regret and confusion swelled inside, and for a moment, he felt utterly lost.

He couldn't see an easy solution, no way to fix things for everyone.

With a sigh, Brandon shut his eyes, trying to wrestle his emotions under control.

He was jolted out of his thoughts by a gruff, furious voice barking his name. "Brandon!"

Blinking awake, Brandon found his grandfather standing over him, face twisted in anger.

"Grandpa," Brandon murmured, barely above a whisper.

"You fool!" Derek snapped. "Why are you here sulking when you should be at Millie's side?"

Brandon couldn't find the words. All he could do was stare back at Derek, drained and silent.

Seeing Brandon's defeated look only stoked Derek's fury.
With people constantly coming and going in the corridor, Derek leaned in to Brandon and said, "Come with me!"

Brandon pushed himself up, steadying himself against the wall, and then trailed after Derek as he marched forward with his cane.

Neither of them spoke as they made their way down the hallway.

They stopped at the emergency exit, where Matthew was ready to help steady Derek and Norma stood nearby,her expression hard.

"I'm not going to repeat myself," Derek said sharply as he fixed Brandon with a glarethat could cut glass."Listen, Brandon, the Watson family will not stand for scandals. Get Millie back right now! If you can't end things with Vivian, I'll handle it myself!"

Yet Brandon found himself glancing toward the nearby stairwell, haunted by the memory of that awful day,when Millie tumbled down the steps because of himn, and later, the painful bruises he saw on Serena during the debut episode of the show Heavenly Melody.

He also recalled the swarm of reporters outside Vivian's apartment when he carried her out.

By now, every headline probably had his name splashed across it.

With everything that happened, would Millie even want to see him again?

Derek's frustration boiled over at Brandon's silence, and he lashed out with his cane. "Say something!".

Brandon simply stood there, unable to get any words out.

Norma finally spoke up, her voice calm but every word heavy. "Brandon, people aren't made of stone. Have you ever thought about the pain you've put Millie through, time and time again? We hoped you'd talk things out last time we brought you both home, but that clearly didn't happen. And now this? Aren't you afraid you'll lose her for good?"

Brandon just stared back at Norma, hollow and lost.

Would Millie actually walk away for good?
He saw her calm, distant eyes in his mind again-how she never looked at him the same way she did again.

The image of her turning her back and leaving after their divorce replayed over and over, haunting him.

Could she really be gone from his life forever?

Brandon's hands curled into fists, uncertainty tightening in his chest.

Derek's voice snapped him back to the present. "Your grandmother is talking, are you even listening?"

He fished out his phone, found Millie's contact, and shoved it at Brandon. "Call her. Tell Millie it's over with Vivian and that you're on your way to see her. Do it, now."

But Brandon only stared at Millie's name on the screen, paralyzed.

"Did you hear me?" Derek snapped.

Brandon's hands shook from how hard he was clenching them.

"Brandon!"

The world around him seemed unreal. In his mind's eye,he saw Millie falling down those stairs 'again, heard her cry out, a memory he could never escape.

Just as Derek drew in breath to shout again, Brandon finally heard his own voice. "We are divorced."

The words felt foreign on his tongue, like they'd come from someone else entirely.

Derek froze mid-swing, cane in the air.

"What did you say?" Derek's tone was all disbelief.

Brandon's gaze dropped, the green glow of the exit sign catching his eye.

"We filed a month ago. It was finalized just a few days back," he said quietly.

For three long seconds, not a sound passed through the hallway. The truth hung in the air, impossible to take back.
Matthew shattered the silence, disbelief ringing in his tone. "Mr. Watson, this isn't something to joke about.You wouldn't really make up something like this just to dodge a call to Mrs. Watson, especially not in front of your grandparents!"

Brandon kepthis mouth shut, jaw clenched tight.

"You.." Derek's anger boiled over, his cane coming down on Brandon's leg again. "Brilliant, Brandon, just brilliant!"

Each breath Derek took came heavy and ragged, his chest heaving with rage as he glared at Brandon,eyes rimmed red. "So you planned to leave Millie at least a month ago? And the whole time you were parading around with Vivian? You ended your marriage for her!"

Derek's hands trembled so hard he could barely hold his cane, his lips quivering in fury."How did we even raise someone like you? I swear, I'll beat some sense into you if it's the last thing I do!"

Derek raised his cane to strike Brandon again, but stopped, his words trailing off."Our family... Watson..."

Suddenly-

"Derek!"

"Mr.Watson!"

Derek's breathing seized, his eyes rolling back as he collapsed where he stood. Matthew and Norma caught him just in time.

"Grandpa!" Brandon lunged to help, but Norma blocked his way, her expression cold and protective.

"Grandma, let me-" Brandon pleaded, reaching out.

"Enough! Get out!" Norma's voice cut through the hallway, sharp and unforgiving. "You're no longer our grandson! You stopped caring about this family ages ago, so don't pretend now? Are you trying to send me to an early grave too?"

Matthew was already dialing for a doctor, panic etched in his features.
"Grandma, that's not true," Brandon protested, his eyes rimmed with red. "Let me help Grandpa-he's not well..."

Norma only shoved him away, her hands as cold as her words.

The emergency exit's sensor lights flickered, throwing them all into a strange, shifting half-light.

No matter how many times Brandon tried to reach his grandparents, Norma blocked him at every turn.

For a split second, the chaos reminded Brandon of that day on the stairwell with Millie, everyone pulling,everything unraveling.

Doctors and nurses rushed over, loading Derek onto a gurney and racing him away for urgent care.

Brandon tried to follow but was left standing outside the emergency room, the doors slammed shut in his face.

Norma's words lingered like ice. "If Derek doesn't make it, I'll go with him. Remember this, Brandon-the weight you carry now is two lives."

Brandon stood alone in the bustling corridor, voices and footsteps swirling around him, none of it sinking in.

He couldn't even hear what they were saying anymore.

Everything felt distant, unreal.

How had his life fallen apart so completely? He'd somehow managed to ruin everything that mattered.

And now, he didn't even know where to begin picking up the pieces.
###Chapter 156 Am I Truly Worth So Little


By the time Millie reached the hospital, evening shadows had already stretched across the corridors.

She had wrestled with herself about coming at all, but Norma's phone call had changed everything.

"Millie, we've learned about your separation from Brandon. Derek... he's taken a turn for the worse," Norma had said, her voice heavy with worry. "I understand you might feel reluctant to encounter Brandon, but please visit Derek and me. Think of it as an opportunity to settle the remaining divorce arrangements."

So Millie had made the trip after all, despite every instinct telling her to stay away.

She walked through the hospital entrance with Alexia beside her, cradling Ari against her chest.

Ari scampered away to explore Alexia's office while Millie steeled herself for what waited ahead-Derek's hospital room and the conversations she'd been dreading.

Brandon stood guard by the door like a sentinel, barred from entering because Derek and Norma had refused him access.

When Brandon's eyes found Millie, his mouth opened as if words might spill out, but she swept past him without acknowledgment, pushing into the room and sealing the door behind her with deliberate finality.

Brandon remained planted in the hallway, his eyes fixed on the barrier between them, drowning in profound melancholy.

···

Within the room's quiet walls, Derek had managed to pull himself back to consciousness.

"Millie, you've made it here," he whispered, his voice barely stronger than paper rustling.

Millie stood frozen, wrestling with conflicting emotions that churned beneath her composed exterior.

Eventually, she managed a small nod and offered a careful greeting. "Hello, Derek."
She stopped treating him as a real family like she used to, and her tone carried an unmistakable chill that hadn't existed before.

Both Norma and Derek recognized the shift immediately. They exchanged glances filled with quiet resignation, understanding that something precious had been irreparably damaged.

Silence settled over the three occupants like a heavy blanket, thick and uncomfortable, until Millie forced herself to break it.

After all, she had traveled here to address the divorce complications that Norma had referenced during their conversation.

Naturally, showing concern for Derek's condition provided another reason for her presence, but settling legal matters remained her primary objective.

Since she and Brandon had severed their legal ties, his relatives would now exist as merely his own family circle.

The financial arrangements posed no real challenges. She refused to play games about rejecting the money and possessions that belonged to her by right. Though she and Brandon had signed prenuptial agreements protecting corporate interests and their marriage had endured merely twelve months, some assets were still legitimately hers to claim.

However, regarding the remnants of the Bennett family's old business ties that were currently under the Watson Group's care, Norma and Derek expected her to negotiate directly with Brandon about those holdings.

"Millie, that involves corporate decisions that stretch far beyond us. Norma and I stepped away from company operations years agoDerek explained, leaving Millie with a familiar surge of exasperation building in her throat.①

Just before Millie prepared to leave, Derek's voice stopped her in her tracks."Millie, we acknowledge only you as our rightful granddaughter-in-law. Vivian will never earn a pace in our family circle!"

Millie's gaze dropped toward the polished floor, offering no response to his declaration
She had severed all connections to Brandon, which meant the Watson family's opinions about her had become irrelevant background noise.

This hospital visit represented her final act of courtesy toward them, a closing gesture she owed to their shared history.

With that resolution firmly planted in her mind, Millie pushed open the door and stepped into the corridor's harsh fluorescent lighting.

Brandon remained exactly where she'd left him, like a statue carved from exhaustion and regret.

His appearance had deteriorated noticeably-shoulders sagging with defeat, eyes rimmed red from sleepless nights as he studied her face with desperate intensity.

"I believe we should engage in a genuine conversation," he stated, his voice carrying the weight of unspoken apologies.

Millie refused to meet his searching gaze, instead fixing her attention on a spot just beyond his shoulder,deliberately avoiding his penetrating stare.

"There exists nothing worth discussing between us,"she responded with practiced detachment."My only remaining interest involves reclaiming the Bennett family's legacy."

Brandon's eyes traced the stubborn line of her profile as she maintained her careful avoidance of direct contact.

"I cannot surrender those to you," he stated, though the words seemed to cost him considerable effort.

Fear gripped him completely-if he surrendered the Bennett family's legacy department to her possession,she would disappear from his world permanently and irrevocaboly.

"Brandon." Millie's voice sharpened as she finally lifted her eyes to meet his tortured expression. "You gave me your word that those holdings belonged to me, and our divorce settlement explicitly grants me the legal right to claim them."

Brandon absorbed the accusation in her tone while sorrow carved deeper lines around his mouth."Then pursue the matter through proper legal channels," he suggested, desperately hoping the legal procedure would grant him at least these five months before he could come clean to her.

Millie's hands formed tight fists at her sides as she fought to regulate her breathing and contain the fury building in her chest.

"Retaining those assets serves absolutely no beneficial purpose for you," she argued with forced logic."The encrypted information systems cannot be duplicated by outside parties, and those specialized programs function effectively only under my direct management. You'll discover that handling them presents enormous challenges, and they maintain virtually no operational connection to the Watson Group's core business. If establishing a financial investment division represents your actual goal, you could easily create one under your complete authority and control."

"I understand that reality perfectly," he admitted without hesitation.

He had never questioned her expertise or doubted her capabilities in that regard. His refusal stemmed entirely from selfish desire-he craved additional time in her presence and desperately needed an opportunity to explain his actions properly when the time was right.

"So." Millie's carefully maintained composure began cracking as anger surged through her restraint. "You're deliberately attempting to torment me out of pure spite? You recognize perfectly well that my chances of victory through litigation remain extremely high, yet you're determined to drag this process out indefinitely?"

Brandon offered no immediate defense, simply studying her increasingly agitated state.

He acknowledged the truth of her accusations completely-she possessed every legal right to reclaim what belonged to her by marriage and agreement.

He was indeed implementing stalling tactics because the thought of releasing her from his life felt unbearable to contemplate.

He had failed to examine the agreement thoroughly on that fateful signing day-had he discovered her carefully orchestrated plan in advance, he would never have attached his signature to those documents.

The hospital corridor stretched endlessly around them, filled with antiseptic silence until Brandon summoned the courage to break it once more.

"Millie," he called her name with desperate tenderness.

Millie offered no response to his searching gaze.

"Did you orchestrate your departure from the very beginning?" Brandon pressed, his voice carrying the weight of dawning realization.

Millie refused to dignify his question with words, though her rigid posture and averted gaze painted a vivid picture of her intentions.

"| recognize that the complications with Vivian have wounded you deeply," he continued, remorse bleeding through every syllable. "But I possessed valid justifications for my actions..."

"Justifications?" Millie's laughter erupted sharp and acidic as she whipped her head around to fix him with a withering stare.

Seven years together reduced to ashes, the precious baby she'd lost to miscarriage during their time in Flesta, and another child torn from her when she'd tumbled down those stairs-could all of this devastating history be swept aside merely because of his so-called "justifications"?

Her hands curled into trembling fists at her sides as she delivered each word with deliberate, cutting precision. "In your twisted perspective, am I truly worth so little?"

Brandon found himnself drowning in the impossibility of explanation, managing only to stare at her with helpless eyes that held no adequate defense.

"I'll ask you one final time-will you release the Bennett family's original department to me or not?" she demanded, her eyes blazing red with unshed tears and barely contained fury.

Still, he remained trapped in his stubborn silence, unable to voice the surrender she desperately needed to hear.

"Perfectly clear," she declared with bitter finality. "Then we shall proceed exactly as you've demanded-through the merciless machinery of legal proceedings."

Recognizing that no purpose remained in prolonging this torture, Millie pivoted away from him with decisive movements, preparing to make her definitive exit.

"Millie." Brandon's voice pursued her retreating form, but she maintained her determined stride without faltering.

"I've always understood your deepest longing for a genuine home," he called after her with desperate urgency. "You transformed our house into something breathtakingly beautiful with your careful attention and love. I treasured having you constantly near me, and I became completely dependent on your presence.Once Vivian's out of the picture... surely we could build a future filled with happiness together? We could create the home you've always dreamed of and raise our children. And that tanzanite stone you picked out..."

The harsh, clinical white light of the hospital corridor bathed everything in its unforgiving glow.


He claimed perfect knowledge of her heart's desire-understood completely that she yearned only for a loving home filled with a devoted partner and children's laughter.

Yet he had systematically destroyed every fragment of that dream with his own ruthless hands.

Rage erupted through Millie's carefully maintained control, and she could no longer contain the inferno consuming her from within.

She whirled around and advanced toward him with purposeful strides, her right hand rising like a weapon seeking justice.

Smack!

The sound of her palm connecting with his face exploded through the hallway, sharp and unforgiving.

He did not attempt to evade her strike, simply regarding her with eyes that reflected nothing but profound sorrow and acceptance.

Smack!

Smack!
Smack!

With her eyes blazing crimson and her teeth clenched so tightly, Millie continued striking him across the face with relentless fury, each blow landing with devastating precision.

She detested everything about this moment-despised his manipulative tactics, hated her own crushing powerlessness, resented being trapped at his mercy while he forced her to endure this prolonged agony.

The sharp percussion of flesh meeting flesh continued echoing through the sterile corridorin a rhythm that matched her breaking heart.

She lost all awareness of how many times her hand found his face, but eventually she registered that his features had already begun swelling grotesquely, and crimson blood now trickled steadily from the corner of his mouth. When her palm encountered the warm wetness during subsequent strikes, droplets scattered across his skin, creating vivid red stains that marked her fury.

He never once attempted to shield himself from her assault, merely watched her through increasingly reddened eyes.

Finally,Millie clenched her trembling hand into stillness, her words completely exhausted.

She wrestled her chaotic emotions back into submission, refused to grant him even one more glance, and turned to walk away from the wreckage of their confrontation.
###Chapter 157 Myron Takes Advantage Of The Opportunity


Millie rounded the corner, her hands trembling despite being tightly clenched. Still, she kept walking. After a few more steps, she turned and entered the restroom.

She switched on the faucet, squeezed out some liquid soap, and began washing the blood off her hands.

The room was quiet, except for the sound of water running in the sink.

Carefully, she scrubbed each finger, not missing a spot. She cleaned until there was no trace of blood left.

When she was done, she turned off the faucet.

But then, a tear slipped down and landed softly on the back of her hand.

Then another. And another. They fell without pause.

She looked up at the mirror. Her lips were pressed into a tight line, defiant. But her eyes were red and puffy.

She once had a happy childhood, but everything changed when her father died.

The Bennett family fell apart. Her mother drifted from place to place, dragging her along until she eventually remarried.

Her stepfather treated her horribly, always venting his anger on her and nearly beating her to death.

Then came Brandon. He pulled her out of that nightmare.

She truly believed he was her savior.

Even after her mother abandoned her, she thought it didn't matter-as long as Brandon was there, she had someone to rely on.

She thought he understood her. All she ever wanted was a simple, quiet life. But instead, he shattered everything.
In the mirror, tears streamed down her face, yet not a single sob escaped her lips.

What her father left behind held more than just memories. It contained trusted employees, encrypted data,a black box, and other secrets.

His death was a mystery. Every attempt to uncover the truth over the years hit a wall.

After digging for years, she came to believe her father had uncovered something dangerous-something that made powerful people want him gone.

Maybe the black box and its unreadable data held the answers.

When her father died, Brandon took over everything. He set up an entirely new department in the Watson Group for it and gave himself full authority, along with everything that came with it.

The data couldn't be copied. It could only be used within that unique system. She could only get it through Brandon.

Maybe he knew that-and that was why he stalled.

Millie dropped her gaze, fists clenched as she forced herself to stay calm.

Just a delay, she told herself.

Without her, he couldn't use those things.

If it came to it, she could take him to court. And eventually, she'd get what was rightfully hers.

It was the best outcome she could hope for. If Brandon hadn't assumed the divorce was temporary and overlooked the fine print, she might never have had a chance.

Now,she just needed patience.

She had to prove herself in business and wait for the right moment.

When she looked up again, her face was calm.

She wiped her tears, straightened up, and gave herself a soft smile in the mirror.
Soon, she would head to Alexia's office to pick up Ari. She had to look composed.

She stood there a little longer, took a few deep breaths, and then walked out when she was sure she was ready.

From a distance, she heard Ari's cheerful laughter.

Millie smiled. It sounded like Ari was having a great time with Alexia.

Quietly, she made her way to the office, curious to see what they were up to.

But when she reached the doorway, she saw that the person with Ari wasn't Alexia.

It was Myron.

They were facing away from her.

Ari stood on a small stool, peering at something on the desk.

Myron stood beside her, holding a pen and explaining something,smiling gently.

"Mr. Elliott, is this really what the little cat looks like?" Ari asked sweetly, pointing at the drawing.

Myron smiled and nodded. "It really is. It's at my place now. If Millie agrees, you can visit it. Or I'll bring it over."

Ari nodded eagerly, but then hesitated."Mr. Elliott, your hand is so steady. But when I draw, sometimes everything turns out crooked."

"I was the same at your age. When I couldn't draw well, I'd even cry. But I kept practicing, and little by litt got better," Myron said kindly.

"Really?" Ari's eyes lit up.

He nodded and gently guided her hand with his.

"See? Much better," he said warmly.

"It really is!" Ari beamed and jumped in excitement.
Myron quickly reached out to steady her before she could fall.

They both laughed. The moment felt cozy and full of warmth.

Millie stood by the door, unsure if the scene in front of her was real.

"Millie!" Ari spotted her suddenly.

She hopped off the stool and ran into Millie's arms.

Millie crouched down and hugged her tight.

"Millie, Mr. Elliott and I were drawing," Ari said, tugging her hand toward the desk.

Millie looked up. Myron gave her a polite nod and smile.

She nodded back and followed Ari to the desk.

Two drawings sat on the table. One was clumsy and full of charm-Ari's. The other was simple, yet striking.Myron had drawn it with a few smooth strokes.

It was the ragdoll cat Millie had seen before.

"Millie, Mr. Elliott said you've seen this cat. Is it true? Does it really have such a big tail? And can it do backflips?" Ari asked.

Millie chuckled. Myron clearly adored his fluffy cat.

She nodded. "Yes, I saw it do a backflip. And its tail is fluffier than a feather duster."

"Then can I..." Ari glanced at Millie, and then at Myron, her-voice going soft. "Can I play with it?"

Her little face was filled with shy hope.

It was too adorable.

She really wanted to meet the cat.

Millie suddenly remembered that night outside the Evans Entertainment building, when Myron had brought the cat to meet her.

"If Mr. Elliott agrees, then you can," Millie said, gently holding Ari's face.

"Yay!" Ari turned to Myron, eyes shining with excitement.

Myron crouched down and met her gaze. "I'll bring it over soon so you can play together."

They were already chatting about when and where to meet.

Watching them, Millie stood quietly.

For a moment, the world around her felt like a dream.
###Chapter 158 Maybe Think Of Me Too


Millie thought back to her days with Brandon. Such moments like this never seemed to happen between them.

Maybe it was simply that children were never part of their lives before.

Myron and Ari seemed to have come to some quiet understanding.

He glanced up at Millie. "Is this time and place alright for you?"

Jolted from her thoughts, Millie remembered what they'd been discussing and gave a small nod.

Ari drifted off to her drawing, leaving Millie and Myron facing each other.

That was when Millie realized that the office was suddenly just the three of them.

The atmosphere felt a little odd.

"Where did Alexia go?" Millie finally broke the silence.

"When I got here, shé was clearing having some stomach issues and asked me to watch Ari fora minute.She said she'd be back soon," Myron replied.

Millie's eyes flicked to the security camera, its tiny light blinking steadily.

Alright then.

She turned her attention back to Myron. "Mr. Elliott, did you stop by to see someone, or are you not feeling well?"

Myron just smiled. "Actually, I came to see you."

Millie'sbrows drew together, but she held her gaze on him, not saying a word.

"Do you have a minute?" Myron asked, his voice soft as he smiled. "Would you mind coming downstairs with me? We can bring Ari with us."

Millie paused for a mnoment and then nodded.

If he wanted her to bring Ari along, it probably wasn't anything sensitive.

"I'll leave a note for Alexia," Millie offered, moving to jot down a message on the table.

"Alright," Myron replied, watching quietly as she wrote.


·.·

Elsewhere,Brandon hadn't moved from where he stood.

Blood trickled from the corner of his lips, leaving tiny red marks on the floor at his feet.

A stranger passing by spotted his condition and quickly called out for a nurse.

The nurse tended to Brandon's injuries, cleaned himn up, and pressed an ice pack into his hand before letting him go.

Now, Brandon found himself alone on a bench at the end of the hallway, ice pack pressed to his cheek, his thoughts a tangled mess.

He gazed absently through the window, watching the scene below.

A door nearby opened, and someone came out to sit quietly beside him.

"Brandon." A voice spoke gently.

Brandon lifted his head to find Vivian there, her complexion washed out and pale.

"What are you doing out here?" Brandon asked with a faint frown, his gaze falling on the fresh bandage around her wrist.

Vivian's eyes lingered on his bruised face instead.

"What happened to you?" she murmured, her eyes rimmed red. "Why do you look so beat up?"
Brandon shook his head, his attention never leaving her bandaged arm.

"It's nothing serious," Vivian said softly, following his line of sight. "The doctors wrapped it up. It'll heal soon."

"I'm so sorry, Brandon. This is all my fault," she said as a tear slipped down her cheek. "I keep making things worse."

Brandon dodged Vivian's outstretched hand, his eyes dropping to the floor.

"Vivian," he said quietly.

Vivian blinked back at him, voice fragile."Yeah?"

He took a steady breath. "Don't ever hurt yourself again,alright?"

Vivian forced a small, shaky smile. "I promise. You don't have to worry."	0

She looked so fragile, heartbreak written across her features. "I don't even know what came over me,and I just lost control for a minute."

"But I'll do better," she added, her voice barely above a whisper.

Brandon finally looked up, his eyes dark and searching as he met her gaze.

Vivian shifted uncomfortably, a hint of worry in her voice.

"Brandon, is something bothering you?" she asked gently.

Brandon didn't answer right away. Instead, he turned his eyes back to the window, the silence stretching between them.

A slow shake of his head was all the reply she got.

Outside, on the far edge of the clearing near the building, a handful of people had suddenly appeared.

They were too distant to make out, just moving shapes he couldn't quite place.

Still, for some reason, those little figures captured his focus.
Out in the clearing, Millíie, Ari, and Myron made their way across the lawn.

Myron stepped aside, heading to a nearby bush and searching around.

Millie kept a gentle hold on Ari's hand, watching curiously as Myron went back with a small bag.

"Lucky for us, no one found this stash while I was gone,"Myron said, pulling out several cylinder-shaped objects.

Millie leaned in, intrigued. "What are those?"

Myron handed one over to her. "Fireworks. Not the big, loud kind. These just make a little noise,nothing crazy."

He offered another one to Ari,smiling."Ari, is this okay for you? I know your condition and that you shouldn't be too excited."

Millie studied the small fireworks, the kind you placed on the ground and watched as they shot up colorful sparks. Before she could say anything, Ari chimned in with a nod.

"I can do it," Ari said ,confidently. "We had these on Christmas Eve at the children's home, the director lit some for us. They were beautiful."

Millie called Alexia to double-check, who gave her a positive reply, so she agreed to let Ari stay.

Myron was already crouched down, arranging the fireworks across the ground.

Lifting Ari into her arms, Millie gently covered the little girl's ears.

The first firework hissed, and then burst into clusters of light, dancing along the ground.

"Wow!" Ari's laughter bubbled out as she clapped her hands, delighted by the show.

Millie couldn't help but smile, letting her hands drop from Ari's ears as the sparks kept flying

For a moment, surrounded by the flickering lights, Millie's own sadness melted away.
"We were supposed to have a drone fireworks display tonight." Myron spoke up quietly beside her. "But...after everything that happened, it got canceled. I didn't want the day to go by without something special, so I brought these for you instead."

Millie gazed at the glowing embers, the meaning behind his gesture clear.

After everything that happened with Vivian's suicide attempt, putting on a big fireworks display for Millie would have just added fuel to the gossip.

She looked at Myron and softly asked,"Why go to all this trouble?"

"Iheard there were fireworks for both your wedding and the night before your divorce," Myron said softly."I know he caused you a lot of pain, and I didn't want fireworks to always remind you of him. That's why,after you won the Heavenly Melody championship, I planned a fireworks display just for you. I hoped that from now on, when you saw fireworks, you'd think of this moment, your victory, instead."

He hesitated, and then quietly added, "And maybe think of me, too."

Millie watched the brilliant bursts of light, every explosion scattering sparkling embers across the night.

Gradually,she shifted her gaze away from the dazzling fireworks and let her eyes settle on Myron.

He wasn't watching the show at all as his attention had been on her the entire time.

There was a gentle smile on his face. "It's a shame they didn't get their big debut," he said, almost wistfully.

The fireworks' glow played across his striking features, lending him an almost ethereal charm.

His gaze never left her, shadowed by a quiet sorrow and a touch of longing.

In that gaze, it was as if she were the only thing he saw.

A smile finally broke across Millie's lips.

Maybe it was time for a fresh start.

Perhaps she was ready for something-and someone-new, after all.

###Chapter 159 Millie Says Yes


Millie smiled. "Well... Let's save that firework show for when things become official between us."

Myron was briefly taken aback.

Millie met his eyes.

"I accept your offer. Let's try to get to know each other better," she said.

In the past few days, he had never crossed any lne.

He hadn't pressured her or made anything difficult.

Most importantly, Ari really liked him.

Millie gently held the little girl's hand.

The Elliott family also had a warm and welcoming atmosphere.

So, Millie decided to give both Myron and herself a chance.

Millie lowered her eyes. "It's just... You know my situation."

She watched as Ari let go of her hand and ran off to see the fireworks. In a quiet voice, she said, "Things are complicated on my end, and my health... I may not be able to have more children. Ari might be my only one."

"Don't worry about that," Myron said with a gentle smile. "As long as you're willing to give me a chance,that's enough."

He already understood her circumstances well.

Once they became official, he'd try his best. Who knew what the future might bring?

Even if there were no more children, they still had Ari.
She hadn't fallen for him yet, hadn't fully accepted him, and their relationship wasn't set in stone-but the fact that she was willing to try meant everything to him.

He would give his all just to earn a piece of her heart.

"Alright," Millie said with a nod, glancing toward Ari.

Myron's gaze stayed on her.

The fireworks lit up the sky, casting long shadows of the two standing side by side.

···

Brandon stood in silence,watching the distant figures.

He saw one of them drift away, searching for something, while the other two remained behind.
0
Beside him, Vivian broke the silence. "I heard your grandfather's here... He's not well. Did he cause it?" she asked softly.

Brandon turned to her pale face, unsure how to respond.

Vivian looked back at him, worry written on her face.

Earlier, she had made arrangements with her caregiver to stage a scene. She had steeled herself and cut her own wrist just seconds before Brandon arrived.

Though it had bled a lot, the cut wasn't deep. The doctor had stitched it up quickly.

So, she already knew exactly how Brandon got injured-because she had been standing nearby, quietly watching.

Brandon's mind was still on Millie-especially after learning that Serena and Millie were the same person.

Vivian felt bitter resentment. But she couldn't go after Millie directly.

Now that she had injured herself, this was the moment Brandon would feel the strongest guilt and sympathy for her.

The more understanding she acted, the deeper his guilt would run.

Vivian believed that guilt, if used well, could get a woman almost anything.

With that in mind, she reached out again, trying to help him press the ice pack on his face.

But he pulled away and said, "I know a mental health facility with good privacy. Want to check it out tomorrow?"

Vivian froze for a moment. Then she realized what he meant.

A mental health retreat? She looked down at her wrist. Was it because of this? But she felt fine-she knew she was fine.

She hesitated, and then asked for the name of the facility.

When he told her, she replied, "Let me think about it. I'll let you know tomorrow, okay?"

Brandon gave her another look, and then nodded.

Outside, fireworks lit up the open ground.

The three people were still watching nearby.

Suddenly, Brandon felt a sharp pain in his chest. It became hard to breathe.

It felt like something important was slipping away.

Slowly,the fireworks faded.

He saw the trio cleaning up the area and leaving. But the pain in his chest wouldn't go away.


···

The day finally came to a close.

It had been full of life, and the excitement spilled into the next morning- because the edited version of Heavenly Melody's grand finale had just gone live.
That morning,Evans Entertainment released a statement to address resurfacing rumors about Serena and Charles.

"Didn't people say Serena had a miscarriage because of Charles? Now that Serena is Millie, does that mean there's something between Millie and Charles?"

The statement came as a video recorded by Charles.

"There were rumors that Serena lost her baby and that baby was mine; and it all began with a leave note,"Charles explained, holding up the forged medical record.

He continued, "At that time, Millie was badly injured. Anyone who watched the live show or the edited cut could see it. Those weren't makeup effects-those bruises were real."

He added, "She was so hurt that she couldn't even leave the hospital, let alone rehearse for the show. But due to a confidentiality agreement, I had to fake a medical record as a leave slip for Serena. That led people to believe we were somehow involved. That's how the rumor started. Millie and I have worked together since before her marriage to Brandon. Ours is a professional relationship. I hope the rumors will stop."

After the video aired, the online chatter quieted down.

The reason was simple.

Neither Charles nor Vivian wanted things to blow up.

Charles didn't want Millie's name dragged through the mud all over again. Vivian, who knew exactly how Millie lost her child, also didn't want anyone digging too deep.

So,the rumor quickly faded.

With fresh stories popping up every day, the public's attention quickly moved on.


···

Elsewhere,Brandon hadn't slept all night.

Thoughts of Millie-both as Millie and Serena-kept running through his mind.
He replayed past moments again and again, feeling more miserable with each one.

He wanted to reach out and tell her the truth. He wanted to say, "I'm sorry, Millie. Please come back."

But when he saw a message fromn Vivian in the morning, he held himself back.

The swelling on his face had gone down, but Millie's slaps had left clear marks.

He'd already told Eugene to cancel his morning meetings.

He looked down at the message again.Vivian had agreed to visit the mental health facility.

Five months, Brandon reminded himself.

Then he got up, drove to pick her up, and the two of them headed to the facility.

As they entered the building, in a nearby office, Rita was on the phone with Millie.
0
Knowing Millie was moving on and embracing changes in her life brought a sense of relief.

"The last few times you came by, I could tell you were getting better," Rita said, just as she looked up-and saw Brandon wvalk in with Vivian.

###Chapter 160 Myron's Marriage Alliance


Millie kept a close eye on Ari as she carried on her phone conversation with Rita.

Softly, she remarked, "Dr. Carpenter, I've noticed lately that my symptoms have evened out quite a bit."Memories of Ari and Myron drawing his cat together the night before drifted through her mind.

"Maybe it's timne I let myself consider new opportunities." A wistful tone entered her voice.

For a moment, the line went quiet, which Millie found a little strange.

Meanwhile, in her office at the facility, Rita heard a gentle knock at the door. Brandon stood there,accompanied by Vivian.

Rita, the physician responsible for Millie's care, was already familiar with the history between her patient and Brandon.

Also,given Brandon's reputation in Crobert, she knew who he was,of course.

Curiosity piqued, she wondered what had brought both Brandon and Vivian to her door today.

After pondering for a second, Rita returned her attention to the call. "Something urgent has come up. Mind if I call you back later?"

Without giving it much thought, Millie agreed.

Once the call ended, Rita focused on her unexpected visitors.

"How can I help you both?" she inquired.

A slight crease formed on Brandon's brow. Hadn't he made sure they had the right appointment scheduled?Why did this woman seem completely clueless?

Vivian opened her mouth to clarify, but a flurry of footsteps down the hallway cut her off.

An apologetic voice sounded as a staff member hurried over. "Excuse me for the mix-up. It looks like you received the wrong appointment slip. Here's the right one."

After a quick exchange of paperwork, things made sense to Brandon at last.

"Sorry about that." The staff member dipped his head in apology, including Rita in his gesture, before Brandon guided Vivian toward the proper office just next door.

Out in the hallway, Rita paused to meet the staff member's eyes.

A sigh escaped him as he said, "The new hire messed up again. He can't even handle handing out slips and pointing to the right office. Honestly, I'm at my wits' end. I keep having to sort out his errors."

A gentle smile spread across Rita's face. "Everyone needs time to learn. Let's be patient with him."

Shaking his head, the staff member replied, "That's not going to cut it! I need to report this and see if he can be moved somewhere less important. I can't keep covering for him." He finished before darting away down the corridor.

Rita followed his retreat with her gaze before letting her attention drift back to the office next door.

...

Meanwhile, in the adjacent room, Brandon sat with Vivian as the doctor began the evaluation.

Self-inflicted wounds already marked Vivian's struggle, a sign of just how grave her depression had become.


Medication and the right course of therapy were no longer optional for her.

Worry etched deeper lines across Brandon's face.

A quick,loaded glance passed between Vivian and the physician.

Only the night before had she pressed Oakley for details about this particular facility.

Although the facility prided itself on ironclad discretion, private ownership allowed for certain test results to be conveniently adjusted.
Oakley had made sure this specific doctor would be overseeing Vivian's case.

No one could downplay the seriousness of her situation, considering both the self-harm and her stomach cancer diagnosis.

Trying to put Brandon at ease, Vivian squeezed his hand and mustered a shaky smile. "You don't need to worry about me," she insisted. "Honestly, I'm already at the point where..." Her words faded, and the concern in Brandon's eyes only deepened.

With hope for answers, he turned toward the doctor.there any alternative treatment you'd recommend?"

No matter what was suggested, it was clear Vivian wouldn't consider taking medication.

A gentle sigh escaped the doctor before he spoke. "I'll see what I can do."

Once the assessment wrapped up, Brandon asked Vivian if she could step into the hallway for a bit.

Inside the quiet office, he faced the doctor with a question.there any way she can manage this without medication?"

A shake of the head came in response. "We're talking about depression here, Mr. Watson..And when it comes to cases as severe as hers, medication is a must for stabilization."

Brandon's eyes dropped to the floor as he considered the gravity of the answer.

Their conversation turned to a few other important topics until, at last, the doctor added, "I'll discuss this with my colleagues and prepare a detailed report along with a treatment plan."

A nod from Brandon signaled his understanding.

"Could you leave a mailing address?" the doctor continued. "To ensure confidentiality, we avoid using online systemns. The full report will be sent as a hard copy to the location you specify."

Accepting the precaution, Brandon gave the address for his apartment neighboring the Watson Group offices.

With the details settled, Brandon walked out into the hall and looked over at Vivian.
"It's time to go," he said, gently guiding her out of the building.

From her desk, Rita kept a low profile, quietly witnessing everything that unfolded.

At no point did she press for information about Vivian's health; instead, she contented herself with silent observation.

Just when she assumed the hall had cleared out, and her hand reached for her office door, Vivian reappeared on her own.

A slight frown touched Rita's lips, the odd timing not lost on her, yet she remained calm, never letting on that anything was amiss.

This time, the neighboring office door sat partly open, and snatches of Vivian's words drifted through the gap. "Yes... That's it... Please update it to my address... Vivian Floral Design..."
0
More words followed, blurred by distance, until V/ivian left the office and departed down the corridor in a hurry.

Suspicion nagged at Rita, the situation not quite adding up, but the details stayed just out of reach.

Professional instincts kept her from voicing any of her concerns, though.

Instead, Rita figured she needed to speak with her colleague to coordinate the schedule so Millie wouldn't bump into Brandon or Vivian should she visit next time.


···

Out in the parking lot, Brandon sat behind the wheel, waiting while Vivian ducked inside the building,mentioning she needed a quick stop at the restroom.

With nothing else to do, he lazily scrolled through his phone,killing time.

An unexpected tidbit of gossip flashed across his screen. Darden's name appeared-this time with a voice message.

Excitement charged through Darden's words. "Big news on the grapevine! The Elliott heir, Myron,has been busy-drone and firework displays, candlelit dinners, lavish gifts, cruise getaways, you name it. Sounds like he's gearing up for an engagement and possibly even a marriage alliance!"

Upon hearing that, Brandon's thoughts drifted to the conversation he'd overheard at the Heavenly Melody finals between Myron, Jayceon, and Adriana.

From what he learnt that night, it was clear Myron meant to move forward with something significant.He remembered catching that the woman in question hadn't agreed to anything just yet.

Given Darden's report about all the over-the-top plans, Myron seemed determined to win her over.

As the situation replayed in his mind, Brandon typed out a message-"Which family is Myron targeting for this marriage alliance?"

A powerhouse like Elliott Group-one of Crobert's biggest-would turn any alliance into headline news, and such a move could change the business landscape for both families.	

A response from Darden came quickly. "Beats me. The Elliotts are playing things close to the vest. Not even Jayceon could slip up and say a word, so we'll just have to wait for the reveal."

A faint frown flickered across Brandon's face.

A burst of voices suddenly drew his attention-an argument had broken out at the reception, though he couldn't tell what sparked it.

Before long, Vivian-made her way back to the car.

"Hope I didn't keep you waiting, Brandon." She offered an apologetic smile.

Setting his phone aside, Brandon turned the ignition and eased the car out of the lot.

Meanwhile, inside Crobert Hospital, Giffard strolled through a quiet corridor and caught snatches of a conversation as he passed.

"Yeah,you heard me-Vivian Simpson. There's something off about her,"someone remarked.

Confusion lingered in another voice. "Seriously, I don't get why she'd go about her treatment this way. None "Yeah, you heard me-Vivian Simpson. There's something off about hsomeone remarked.

Confusion lingered in another voice. "Seriously, I don't get why she'd go about her treatment this way.None of it adds up."
###Chapter 161 No Woman Will Ever Forgive Such A...
Giffard discovered the conversation both perplexing and intriguing, prompting him to step through the doorway with purpose.



"What exactly are you discussing?" he inquired, his curiosity evident.



"Hey there, Giffard!" Came the warm greeting.



Inside the room stood two physicians, both longtime colleagues who had worked alongside him for years.



Giffard acknowledged them with a measured nod before pressing forward. "I couldn't help but overhear Vivian's name being mentioned."



The physicians exchanged a meaningful look, their expressions growing more serious as they nodded in unison.



"The situation strikes me as peculiar," the taller doctor began, his voice weighted with concern."Vivian approached me not long ago, bringing her medical records along to secure painkillers. I strongly recommended she undergo a thorough examination to explore any possible treatments or methods to extend her life,yet she adamantly refused."


The taller doctor's expression darkened as he continued, "I dismissed it initially as an isolated incident, but now the same troubling pattern has emerged once more."



His thinner colleague stepped forward, bobbing his head in agreement. "She attempted to end her life by slashing her wrist, but following the bandaging and careful suturing, she simply vanished from our care.I proposed a comprehensive evaluation while we treated her, but she rejected it outright."


"What baffles me most," the thinner doctor continued,his voice filled with professional concern, "is that patients typically refuse examinations or treatments only when they can't afford, but Vivian doesn't appear to face such problem. I mean, yes, she has terminal illness, but we can still do something to make it less painful."



The two medical professionals shared another weighted glance, their synchronized nods revealing shared bewilderment.


Giffard absorbed their words, his eyebrows knitting together in deep concentration.


The situation was undeniably bizarre.


"Was her diagnosis of terminal cancer confirmed in Flaville? And all her medical records are there?"Giffard questioned, his investigative instincts awakening.



The taller doctor confirmed with a slow nod, but then quickly steered their discussion toward lunch arrangements, effectively abandoning the troubling topic.



However, Giffard couldn't shake the disturbing details from his thoughts and promptly contacted Millie to share the disturbing information.



Millie discovered the situation equally perplexing,her memory drifting to how she had previously asked Charles to reach out to his connections in Flaville.



"I'll press Charles for answers," Millie declared with determination.



"Sounds good," Giffard responded, pausing thoughtfully before he too began reaching out to his former classmates from medical school.


The Hussain family had maintained their medical practice across multiple generations, building an impressive legacy within the healthcare community and cultivating an extraordinarily vast professional network.



"I've established contact with my sources, but the information remains classified and will require  considerable time to obtain," Charles explained,offering Millie some measure of reassurance.


She sensed something sinister lurking beneath the surface, but concrete evidence remained essential before drawing any definitive conclusions.


Her immediate priorities centered on Ari's upcoming surgery and the escalating legal battle with Brandon.



What devious scheme was Brandon orchestrating behind the scenes?



Millie struggled to comprehend his motivations.


Just as these troubling thoughts consumed her attention, Derek's call interrupted her contemplation.



Millie's expression darkened with confusion-hadn't they resolved everything thoroughly during last night's conversation? What purpose could Derek possibly have for contacting her again?



Could there perhaps be an unexpected development in her quest to reclaim the Bennett family's former department?



With these questions swirling through her thoughts,Millie accepted the call.


Meanwhile, across the city at the imposing Watson Group headquarters, Derek sat behind his executive desk, directing a look of pure exasperation toward Brandon.



"What did you just say? You harbor intentions of marrying Vivian?" Derek's voice cracked with barely restrained fury, though the previous night's devastating revelations had somehow strengthened his emotional armor. "I absolutely refuse to allow this travesty!" Derek's piercing glare bore into Brandon with unmistakable contempt. "And what in heaven's name happened to your battered face?"



Brandon's composure wavered for just a moment."Millie struck me."



"You had it coming in spades!" Derek proclaimed with unwavering conviction."You thoroughly deserved her wrath!"



Brandon's head dropped in defeat, words failing him completely, while Derek's rage rendered him momentarily speechless with indignation.



Nearby, Norma observed the tense confrontation unfolding before her, her expression revealing layers of conflicted emotions as she studied Brandon's defeated posture. "Brandon, you must consider this decision with utmost care and deliberation.Should you and Vivian proceed with marriage, there will be no possibility of reconciliation with Millie. Regardless of whatever justifications you might offer," Norma  explained with maternal concern. "No woman will ever forgive a man who commits such a profound betrayal."



Brandon's hands curled into tight, trembling fists at his sides.



"Once this entire ordeal reaches its conclusion," he muttered through gritted teeth. "I'll provide her with a complete explanation."



"Explain exactly what?" Derek exploded, striking Brandon sharply with his ornate walking cane. "I'm convinced you've become completely infatuated with Vivian! Don't assume I remain ignorant of the truth;she masquerades herself as some modern,independent woman while boasting about her supposed achievements in luxury floral design, yet she's systematically draining your resources dry.Without your financial backing and your influential friends propping up her business, could she possibly maintain such an extravagant lifestyle? My investigation revealed that merely a year ago, she was operating nothing more than a modest neighborhood flower shop!"



Brandon maintained his downcast posture, lacking the courage to offer any defense.



Derek's fury blazed white-hot, refusing to dignify Brandon with even a cursory glance.
"I've already summoned Millie to join us here," Derek announced coldly, extending two official documents toward Brandon.



Brandon accepted the papers with trembling hands,disdovering they contained detailed wager agreements stipulating that specific conditions must be satisfied before the contractual terms would be officially executed.



His brow furrowed with genuine confusion as he lifted his eyes to meet Derek's stern expression.



"The Watson family refuses to sink so low as to retain Millie's rightful possessions through such shameless means," Derek declared with unwavering conviction."She remained faithfully by your side for seven complete years, enduring every hardship and triumph alongside you. These items legitimately belong to her ownership."



"Grandpa!" Brandon caught himself as his tone turned sharp,desperately attempting to regulate his spiraling emotions. "I simply cannot surrender them to her."



"Absolutely shameless!" Derek struck him once more with his cane, the sound echoing sharply.



Yet Brandon remained steadfast in his opposition.



He had committed countless acts that wounded Millie deeply, and her anguish and tears continued to plague his conscience relentlessly.



The guilt left him perpetually sleepless and emotionally devastated.



He understood with crystal clarity that she despised him completely.



She loathed his betrayal, despised how he had systematically destroyed her trust and happiness.


He could only desperately cling to the Bennett family's possessions, using them as leverage to prevent her from drifting too far beyond his reach.


Once this terrible ordeal finally concluded,he would lay bare every hidden truth before her.



He knew with absolute certainty that she had always dreamed of creating a loving home with him and raising their children together.



She had not yet made their divorce proceedings public knowledge.



Therefore,she would eventually find it in her heart to forgive his transgressions.



However, to make all that happen, first he needed to keep her within his sphere of influence..
"I cannot relinquish these belongings to her," Brandon repeated,his eyes now bloodshot with raw emotion.



Derek responded with a cold, mocking laugh, "I anticipated exactly that response from you, which is precisely why I drafted this wager agreement."



"Grandpa..." Brandon continued to voice his disagreement.



"You constantly claim that Vivian is dying, so you feel compelled to indulge her every whim. But what consideration do you show for my remaining life?"Derek fixed Brandon with an intense stare. "This agreement provides you with one final opportunity.Should you refuse to participate, I'll end my life right here before your very eyes! Don't you dare forget that when I was drawing my last breaths,you grasped Millie's hand and fell to your knees before me,desperately pleading for my blessing on your marriage!"



Brandon's eyes blazed crimson with overwhelming emotion as he rapidly scanned through the agreement's contents.



At that precise moment, someone rapped firmly against the office door.



Eugene stepped inside with professional composure "Mr.Watson, Mrs. W-Miss Bennett and Vivian have arrived as requested."

Observing that Brandon had ceased his protests,Derek nodded his approval. "Please escort them inside immediately."



Consequently, Millie and Vivian entered the office together, their contrasting energies immediately apparent.



Millie acknowledged everyone with a polite, restrained nod, while Vivian radiated unbridled enthusiasm."Good afternoon, Mr. Watson, Mrs. Watson." Vivian felt her heart soar with unexpected joy. They had finally agreed to meet with her personally, which perhaps signaled their grudging acceptance of her presence?



Earlier that morning, Brandon had just warned.her emphatically that his grandparents refused to see her regardless of the circumstances.



"You two take a look at these documents carefully,"Derek instructed as he handed the papers to Eugene,who efficiently distributed copies to both Millieand Vivian.



Millie studied the document's contents intently, her eyes narrowing with sharp focus as she absorbed each crucial detail.



"According to the terms outlined in this agreement,"Derek began with deliberate formality. "Millie, should you emerge victorious, within exactly three months,all the items you desire will be transferred directly into your legal ownership."
###Chapter 162 Publicly Announcing The Divorce
Millie lifted her head and saw Derek smiling at her.



"If you lose, you'll have topay triple the amount listed in the lawsuit to buy it all back," he said.



Tears welled up in Millie's eyes.



If she followed Brandon's advice and chose to go through with the lawsuit, the first trial alone could last half a year. After that, a second trial might follow.


Then came the execution and handover phase. If the entire process dragged on, it could stretch over a year,maybe even two.



Now, Derek was basically offering her an opportunity to quickly reclaim everything that belonged to the Bennett family.



Millie's eyes darted toward Brandon. He was focused on the documents in front of him, wearing a blank look.



Derek picked up on her silenceand gave a reassuring smile. "Don't worry. It's my decision to make, not his."
Then he looked Vivian's way.



"You want to be part of my family, don't you? I'm giving you that opportunity now," Derek said. "You've read the terms. If you win, you'll be accepted by us as Brandon's wife. But if you lose, you'll have to apologize to Millie publicly and leave Crobert for good."


He paused, and then added, "Taking your condition into account, the agreement allows a three-month period. That means you and Brandon still have two months left to organize the wedding."


Vivian's heart surged with excitement.


She had pressed Brandon again and again, but he always held back. The revelation that Serena was, in fact,Millie had only made him more hesitant.



The Watson elders had never fully welcomed her,but now,she finally had a real shot, as long as she could come out victorious.



Everyone's eyes were on the agreement.



Millie saw the terms plainly.



In three months, each side would complete their designated projects. Then, under Derek's supervision,a panel of professionals would evaluate and score the  results. The person with the highest score would be declared the winner.



The evaluation would center on several factors like profit margins, cost efficiency, project complexity,and most importantly, return on investment, which was the biggest deciding factor.



Cheating in any form was strictly prohibited.



For example, if Brandon or his friends mass-purchased flowers directly from Vivian Floral Design to inflate her sales, it would be considered a violation.



However, if they signed honest contracts with her to employ her service, that would be acceptable.



The same rules applied to Millie, though she had no connections or resources to exploit even if she wanted to.



"I've looked into it. You both have your own strengths,"Derek said.



He shot a glance at Brandon and let out a snort.



He knew full well that Brandon would do everything he could to support Vivian, and would likely give her numerous contracts. That alone would give her the upper hand.



Vivian seemed to have the same thought. On top of that, she had skills in both floral design and marketing



Those skills would definitely come in handy. After studying the agreement, she quickly understood that return on investment was the key factor. She had a powerful monetization tool at her fingertips. This was her miniseries, Love of Vivian.



Floral business alone wouldn't bring in much revenue,but the miniseries would.



She could launch an aggressive marketing campaign and introduce multiple revenue streams to maximize her earnings.



There was also the theater route. The film company they partnered with was already in the process of securing approvals, and Brandon was actively helping with promotion.



If everything went as planned, the box office potential would be enormous.



Vivian was confident that her marketing skills could drive massive ticket sales.



Meanwhile, Millie's income from songwriting was not a lot, and she wasn't even close to being a celebrity.She was still just an emerging artist. Even with the exposure from winning Heavenly Melody, how far could she really go in just three months?



Compared to the billions a movie could easily earn,how could Millie stand a chance?



"You only made it this far because of Brandon. Now that he's no longer backing you, Millie, let's see what you can do on your own," Vivian thought with a cold glint in her eyes.



Out loud, she said calmly, "I have no objections to the terms."



Millie kept her eyes on the contract, .running calculations in her mind.



After winning Heavenly Melody, she had signed a few contracts with the sponsors, but most of the resources promised to her needed her to take the initiative.



Whatever progress she made within these three months would count toward her return. However,she still had to work with the partner companies' timeline,which severely limited her flexibility.



Still,that didn't shake her.



A small smile tugged at Millie's lips. If this was the game, then she was willing to play it.



She didn't believe opportunities would stay out of  reach forever.



Besides, she couldn't stand waiting endlessly. Delays would only bring her more uncertainty.



With this in mind, Millie spoke up. "I have no objections either."



Derek gave a nod of approval.



Both women moved forward and signed the agreement.



Brandon stood off to the side, silently watching them.



He knew Millie was clearly acting out of anger. That was the only explanation for her determination.



He had to make sure that she didn't win. Because only then could he keep her close.



Millie signed quickly, took her copy, and passed the rest of the documents to Eugene.


"If there's nothing else, I'll be taking my leave," Millie said as she turned to leave.



She was about to reach the elevator when Vivian's voice rang out behind her. "Millie."



Millie stopped for a moment and turned around.



Vivian was walking toward her alone. Millie's eyes flicked to the bandage on Vivian's wrist.



Vivian came to a stop in front of her, looking cocky.



"I didn't think you'd actually have the guts to sign,"she said with a smirk.



Millie slightly arched an eyebrow.



"You're going to lose, and it won't even be close,"Vivian said with a bright smile that didn't quite reach her eyes.



She went on, "In three months, make sure you show up at Brandon and I's wedding banquet. I'll save you a special seat."



Vivian tilted her head as she mocked, "Maybe I'll call it the 'ex-wife table.' Or how about "the discarded'?Doesn't that have a nice ring to it?"



Millie almost laughed.



To be honest, the moment she chose to walk away from Brandon, his future with Vivian stopped mattering to her.



If it weren't for this competition, she might've even wished them a happy married life.



With that thought, she replied calmly, "Not everyone sees Brandon as a prize. To me, he's just someone l met as I went through life. It's such a pity to see someone throw away who they are just to cling to a man."



She had no interest in dragging it out further."If you want him, make sure you cling unto him with all your might."



With nothing more to say, Millie stepped into the elevator.



As she turned to press the button for her floor, her eyes briefly met Brandon's. He was standing not too far away with slightly red eyes, holding a file. He didn't speak a word.



Millie wwasn't sure how much of the conversation he had heard, but it didn't matter anymore.



She pressed the button and watched as the elevator doors slid shut, closing off the sight of Brandon and Vivian.



The floor numbers blinked in red as the elevator descended smoothly.



When it reached the ground floor, the doors opened.



Millie stepped out, holding her documents tightly in one hand as she walked through the lobby and out of the Watson Group building. She had just raised her hand to call a taxi when she spotted a familiar black Bentley parked nearby.


Smiling, she wwalked toward the car, opened the passenger side door, and got in.


"| heard the Watsons called you in," Myron said,looking at her. "Did Brandon give you a hard time? Do you need anything?"



Millie looked at him quietly, saying nothing.



Vivian's words echoed in her mind, stirring something inside her. She reached into her bag and pulled out the divorce papers.



Myron didn't interrupt. He just watched patiently.


She opened the document, found the page she wanted,took out her phone, and took a photo of it.



Then, she opened her personal social media account under the name Millie, and began typing a short message. "Cheers to a fresh start."



She attached the photo she just took, and then hit post.
###Chapter 163 Millie Publicly Severed Ties With The...

Millie looked up from her phone and caught the faint smile forming at the corners of Myron's mouth.



"I thought you might want to wait a little longer," he said.



She raised an eyebrow. "Really? Then maybe you don't know me as well as you think."



Myron's eyes crinkled. His tone was light but held a trace of expectation. "Well, I suppose I have all the time in the world to change that."



Millie didn't respond.



Her gaze shifted to her phone, where a stream of messages continued to roll in. After a moment's thought, she opened her profile and updated it by adding "Singer, Serena."



She deleted every reference to the Watson Group.


Once finished, she looked at Myron.,where to next?"



She still had to consider the wager agreement, but Myron wasn't just a casual acquaintance. He was also one of her business partners. Most of the champion's resources for Heavenly Melody came directly fromthe Elliott Group.



Myron glanced briefly at the document in her hand.He didn't say much. "Let's start with lunch. I know a place you might like."



Millie nodded. "Sounds good."







Elsewhere,Brandon sat in the back of a car, staring at the flood of notifications on his phone.



Under the hashtag #MillieAndBrandonDivorce, the comments were relentless.



"I saw this coming the moment Serena took off her mask on Heavenly MAelody."



"Rumor has it they started the divorce process before Vivian's condition got worse. Looks like it was finalized fast."



"Millie, I misjudged you. I thought you stayed for money.Now I see you're moving on without hesitation."



"Look at her profile. She removed all mention of the Watson Group and Brandon. It's just her now." More	hashtags	appeared	soon	after:	#

MillieUpdatesProfile,	#

MillieCutsTiesWithWatsonGroup



Brandon read every word, his grip tightening around the phone.



Was she really this resolute?


Earlier at the office, he had only caught the tail end of her conversation: "Not everyone sees Brandon as a prize. To me, he's just someone I met as I wwent through life."



Just someone she met as she went through life? After seven years of shared memories, long nights, and mutual effort-was that really all he meant to her?



Beside him, Vivian was typing on her phone.He glanced her way.



She noticed, slipped her phone into her bag,and looked at him with a soft smile.



"Brandon,you'll help me, won't you?" she said quietly,her expression fragile. "You'll fight for our future together, right?" She looked like someone who needed protection.



Brandon's eyes dimmed. He clenched the agreement in his hand. Yes," he replied.



He couldn't let Millie win. He couldn't let her slip away.



His phone buzzed again.



It was a message from Darden, who had a knack for digging up rumors. "Explosive news! Someone saw Myron shopping for a toddler. He even bought some decor in a little girl's style!"



Brandon frowned.A girl?



Another message followed. "Not sure who the woman is, but she had a child with her."



The image of Ari came to mind.



Brandon shook his head.



He knew Myron well enough. Behind his cultured mask was a man known for never getting his hands dirty,yet always winning.



His gentlemanly act must've fooled so many people.He was cunning, careful, and patient.



If Myron was involved with someone, it would be a calculated move. Likely someone with a powerful background that could boost his family's business.



But who could it be?

As the car sped along, Brandon stared out the window,silent.








Inside a suite at an international hotel, a man sipped wine while scrolling through the trending headlines.


A waiter stood nearby and spoke politely. "Mr. Perez,everything your request has been arranged. Do you need anything else?"


Egbert lowered his glass and waved him off.



He walked slowly toward the floor-to-ceiling windows,eyes fixed on the lights below.


"Divorce," he murmured. "Millie, I wonder if youstill remember what you once said to me. The man you would have sacrificed everything for... now let you down."



His reflection in the glass stared back at him. "But maybe it's a good thing."



He raised his glass as if toasting someone far away."Walking away from him might lead you somewhere brighter."







Derek and Norma sat side by side as Matthew drove to Moonlit Estate.



"Do you really think this will work?" Norma asked."Will Millie win?"



Derek scoffed. "Do you think she's less capable than Vivian?"



"Not in ability," Norma replied. "But still..."



Derek looked at his wife and sighed. "If we hand everything to Millie directly, Brandon would fight us on it. We needed a plan that lets him think he still has control. Using the illusion of marriage with Vivian and a few strategic threats should do it."



Norma nodded. They had agreed on the approach before.



Outside, the city rushed by. Derek watched the blur of movement and said quietly, "If he can see Vivian for what she is, and how kind Millie truly is, then all of this might be worth it."








Brandon dropped Vivian off at her flower studio,Vivian Floral Design,and then headed straight back to the Watson Group.



At the entrance, Eugene was already waiting, visibly anxious. "Mr. Watson, we've been swamped with calls Executives,partners-everyone's demanding answers."


Eugene had messaged him earlier, prompting the urgent return.



Babette appeared soon after, flustered and agitated.



"Brandon, this is getting out of control," she said. "The shareholders are furious. They're saying they should have been notified about the divorce. Some are worried this will trigger a billion-dollar stock split. And the partners Millie handled are asking questions."


Her voice rose. "Why didn't she tell us before going public? Now we're in the middle of a crisis!"



Brandon shot her a cold glance. She stopped speaking at once.



He knew it wasn't Millie's fault. He had been sitting on the divorce decree for days. He had plenty of time to act but he did nothing, so Millie had every right to move forward.



Babette didn't stop. "Brandon,you know many of our partners worked with her directly. If she's severing ties with the Watson Group in public like this, I'm afraid some of them might walk away."


Eugene added,"And the stock price... it may not hold steady much longer."
###Chapter 164 It's True



The trio headed to the private elevator.



As they ascended, Babette and Eugene quickly filled Brandon in on the situation.



Just before the elevator doors opened, Babette,acting on impulse, asked, "Did you and Millie really get divorced?"



She pressed further. "Is what she posted real? Did the two of you actually sign the papers?"


Brandon didn't respond right away. He then nodded without looking at her, stepped out and made his way toward the meeting room.



Babette followed, trailing behind with a conflicted expression. She opened her mouth to speak but said nothing,quietly catching up to face the crowd inside.







Meanwhile, Millie and Myron had just finished lunch and were now visiting one of Elliott Group's jewelry stores.



As they walked, Myron explained the various divisions within the company.
Over lunch,he had learned about the agreement Millie had recently signed.



She hadn't kept it a secret.



After all, her win at Heavenly Melody had brought her commercials here, and she wasn't rigid.



She understood that Brandon would back Vivian, and in her eyes, accepting help and forming practical,mutually beneficial relationships was only logical.



After a brief tour of the regular businesses, Myron led her down a winding corridor to a quieter part of the building.



They passed several security checkpoints before pausing at the last one for a short conversation.


"Did you hear what happened at Watson Group?"Myron asked, glancing at her.



Millie nodded. She had expected fallout once the divorce became public.



"'I've said before," she replied calmly, "that his affairs have nothing to do with me."



"That's not what I meant." Myron smiled. "Tomorrow,when the market opens, Watson Group's stock will probably take a hit. Don't you want to do something about it?"



Millie met his gaze with a steady look.



"There are certain things I don't want to be part of,"she said.



"And yet there will always be people who do," Myron replied.



They held each other's gaze. Millie knew exactly what he meant. He must have predicted everything when he saw her announcement.



With a public divorce, rumors about a massive settlement were inevitable. The stock price was bound to fluctuate.



That was why he had said, "I thought you might want to wait a little longer."



He was perceptive.



"It seems I need to reevaluate you, Mr. Elliott," Millie said.



"I'm flattered," he answered with polite charm.



They exchanged a subtle, knowing smile.



Smart people always knew when to stop.



Just then, the click of high heels echoed down the hallway. Adriana approached with a bright smile.



"There you are," she greeted warmly.



Millie turned from Myron and returned the smile."Hello,Miss Elliott."



"Just call me Adriana," she said and hen led them farther in.



They made their way to a compact storeroom filled with gemstones.



"These are the new pieces we plan to launch," Adriana explained. "I was managing them, but Myron just told me he'll be overseeing them now, in line with our agreement with you."


Millie glanced at the six gemstones on display. Each one was remarkably rare.



"Your contract with Elliott Group guarantees the corresponding endorsements," Myron said as he guided Millie to examine them up close. "The marketing for this collection is in your hands now.Let's see what you can do."



The gems sparkled under the showroom lights.



Millie looked up at him. "How much creative control do I have?"
"Total freedom," he said with a confident smile."You're free to approach it however you like."



Millie's lips parted slightly. She didn't quite understand why he was offering her so much leeway.



Ever since he confessed his feelings, she hadn't fully grasped his intentions.



She looked back at the gems and said, "Don't worry.You'll be more than satisfied with the results."



"I'm counting on it," Myron replied.








At the same time, chaos was erupting inside Watson Group.



What began as gossip had quickly spread to the finance world. Now, major financial bloggers were dissecting Brandon and Millie's divorce.



One well-known blogger posted, "We've seen this pattern before. A public divorce leads to stock splits,and the wife cashes out at the peak. These so-called 'sky-high divorce settlements' tend to rattle the market."



The comments poured in.



"I remember when I got hit with three limit-downs because of a divorce scandal. Never again."


"Same here. I was stuck holding stock I couldn't even sell."



"Are Brandon and Millie about to pull the same move?"


"No idea. But seriously, I should've known something was up when Brandon kept going out in public with Vivian. She's practically on her deathbed, and she's still clinging to him. Can't she let Millie and Brandon live their lives? She's dragging down the whole company!"



"When the market opens tomorrow, it's every man for himself."



Back in the Watson Group meeting room, Brandon's expression had turned stormy.



The room buzzed with conversations, video calls, and nonstop questions from all directions.



"We just got a call from Eldoria," someone reported."They said Millie used to handle communications.Now that the divorce is public, they don't know how to proceed."



"Mr.Watson, partners from Vascuosia are asking what Millie's next role will be and how the transition is being managed."
"There's more..."



While the tension mounted, a Rolls-Royce Phantom pulled up outside the building.



A man stepped out.



His features blending seamlessly with the locals-except for his eyes, which had a faint reddish hue.



Unless you were paying close attention, you wouldn't notice.



He walked into the building and took the elevator to the meeting room.



When he reached the guarded door, the staff member quickly went inside to announce him.



Moments later, the doors opened and the man walked in. "It's been a while, Brandon."



At the far end of the table, Brandon's brow tightened at the familiar voice. He looked up, his eyes narrowing at the figure now standing in the doorway



Beside him,Babette immediately stepped forward with a welcoming smile. "You're here, Egbert."



He gave her a nod.



"I saw the news and thought we should talk about our collaboration," Egbert said, his gaze fixed on Brandon."You know how that contract came to be in the first place, after all."

###Chapter 165 Tit For Tat



In the meeting room,people glanced at one another,and a ripple of murmurs spread through them



"Who is that? Why is he acting arrogant?"



"Isn't he the head of that big conglomerate from Flesta? | heard that back when the Watson Group was trying to turn things around, they ran into serious tech hurdles. Then Mr. Watson and Mrs. W-I mean Millie,flew to Flesta to lock in a deal, and the first signature they got was from this guy's family. That was when things really started to change for the Watson Group."



"Oh, I see. The Perez family, right? I've heard they've got insane influence overseas."



"Exactly. Once their contract came through, the other deals followed like dominoes."



"So that's what happened..."



While the room buzzed with speculation, Egbert said nothing. His eyes stayed on Brandon, intense and sharp-like someone who'd clawed his way through fire and blood to get where he was



Things in Flesta weren't like here. Guns weren't illegal there. One didn't get to the top of the business world with board meetings and polite handshakes. One got there by surviving.



Egbert finally said, "No seat for me?" His smile was casual. "When you and Millie came to Flesta, l remembered I showed great hospitality."



He lingered on those words, "great hospitality."



Brandon's eyes didn't waver. He met Egbert's look head-on, cold and steady.



The air between them felt charged. Each look they shared was sharp, wordless, and full of challenge.



The room itself seemed to hold its breath, wrapped in a silence that throbbed with unease.



Murmurs spread among those present.



"What's happening? What was he talking about just now? How exactly did that contract come to be?Wasn't it handled through the proper channels?"



"Come on. Back then, Watson Group didn't stand a chance against Egbert's conglomerate. There's no way they landed that deal without his approval. But... there were whispers. Something strange happened around then."



"Like what?" "No one knows for sure. But after that trip, Millie was bedridden for weeks."



"Wait,really?"



"Can't you see it yet? Everything falling apart now started the moment Millie pulled away from the Watsons. In those early days, when the company was trying to find its footing, she was there, right next to Mr. Watson, step for step. The two of them were in it together,completely intertwined."



Off tothe side, Babette was the first to snap back to herself. She walked up with a polished smile and motioned toward an open seat.



"This way, please," she said sweetly.Her eyes lingered on Egbert,bright with a hint of admiration.


But Egbert didn't budge. He kept his gaze locked on Brandon, making it clear he wouldn't move unless Brandon invited him himself.



Babette's smile froze for a second, but then softened again like nothing happened. She turned to her cousin.



"Brandon?" she said carefully.



She remembered all the rumors she heard from her time in Flesta-stories that sounded dramatic and unclear,involving Egbert, the Watsons, and Millie. No one ever confirmed anything.



Even when Babette tried to corner Millie and get the truth out of her, Millie had revealed nothing



Now,worry took hold of her.



She turned slightly as she slipped her phone from her clutch, hoping to sneak away and call Millie. But Brandon's glare stopped her cold. One look, and she put the phone away.


Egbert caught the whole thing. He grinned maliciously."Not planning to show me even a little hospitality?" he said. "And what? Aren't you going to try calling Millie?"


He pulled out his own phone. "It's alright. I'll call her myself."



He shot Babette a pointed smile. "Thanks for the wine you sent to Millie. That's actually my favorite.Thought I'd ask her what she thought ofit."



The smile never reached Egbert's eyes. Babette felt a chill run through her. Something about Egbert reminded her of a dangerous snake.



But he didn't pause. He started to dial. Then, just before he could press the button, a hand gripped his wrist.


 
Egbert looked straight at Brandon, their eyes locking. "Going to stop me now?" he asked with a smirk,sliding one hand into his pocket.


A second later, Brandon felt something cold press against his abdomen.



He didn't flinch. He narrowed his eyes, stepped forward without hesitation, and closed the distance between them.



"You dorealize this isn't Flesta," Brandon said quietly "There are gun laws here."



Egbert chuckled low, unmoved. His eyes stayed fixed on Brandon as he raised his phone and started to dial.



The phone rang.


Brandon made a move for Egbert's pocket, but Egbert was quick. He dodged and took a step back.



"Hello?" Millie's voice came through.



Egbert smiled and looked right at Brandon's face,taking in the tightness in his jaw. "Millie," he said smoothly. "It's me. Been a while. How've you been?”



The other end stayed completely silent.



Brandon lunged again, aiming for the gun. Egbert didn't hold back this time. He pulled it out from his pocket and raised it straight to Brandon's forehead. Seeing Brandon's eyes narrow, Egbert smirked and said,"I heard you and Brandon got divorced. Congrats!"



Millie still didn't reply.



"So-" Egbert continued, chuckling. "I'm here at Watson Group. Thought we could revisit that old contract we signed years ago.How about you drop by?"



The two men stood locked in silence, eyes unblinking,neither backing down.



Around them, the murmurs had dried up. People glanced at one another, unsure, uneasy.



The room held its breath. In that moment, it felt like nothing else existed-just the two men facing off and Millie on the phone line.



Three long seconds passed before Millie finally said,"All right."



Egbert smiled and kept his eyes fixed on Brandon,already smug. "Great! I knew you'd-"


But before Egbert could get the words out, the line went dead, the flat beep of disconnection filling the silence.



For a second, he just stood there, caught off guard,his eyes dropping to the phone in his hand. Millie had hung up on him.



Before he could react, Brandon seized the moment and reached forward to snatch the gun from his hand.



Instinctively, Egbert pulled the trigger. Then, a small flower sprang from the barrel,leaving Brandon frozen in surprise.



"Surprise!" Egbert laughed.



It was a toy gun.


The room exhaled all at once, the tension evaporating like mist.



Brandon let go of Egbert's hand and turned to Babette and Eugene. "You two handle things here. If it gets messy, stall. Say we'll hold a press conference to explain everything."



"Got it," Babette replied instantly.


"Understood, Mr. Watson," Eugene responded as well.


Brandon turned back to Egbert, eyes hard."You-come with me."



Egbert looked like he might ignore him. Brandon smirked. "Unless you want everyone hearing what really happened back then." Egbert shrugged like it didn't matter. "You think I care?"


But he glanced down at his phone again.



She might care.



Without another word, Egbert followed Brandon out of the room.



Only Eugene, Babette, and a handful of stunned executives remained inside.



Phones kept ringing without pause, but everyone's thoughts were consumed by curiosity.



Babette frowned, her cold glare sweeping across the room.



"Didn't you hear him? Get back to work!" she snapped.


Chairs shifted. Heads bowed. The room fell back into motion.



Elsewhere,Millie slowly lowered her phone.



She and Myron had just stepped out from the vault where they'd been reviewing the Elliott Group's new products.



Millie's face had gone pale, eyes distant.



Years back in Flesta, she had lost her first child. That memory still lived at the center of her chest.



She had avoided that place ever since. Avoided the people, the reminders, the weight of it all.



When the business started to expand, she passed the Flesta branch to Babette, who had been studying there. But before that, it had been Millie who laid every brick, built every structure, forged every deal.


And now Egbert was here. When had he arrived? And why now?



Noticing the change in Millie's demeanor,Myron asked carefully, "What's wrong?"
###Chapter 166 Three Surprises
Millie shook her head. She didn't share the details with the Elliott siblings, only saying she needed to leave



Myron paused. "Where are you going? I'll drive you."



She glanced at him. "Watson Group."



He studied her for a moment, and then gave a silent nod.



Before long, the car stopped outside the Watson Group building.


"I'll go up with you," Myron offered.



"No need," Millie replied. "I've got this." She didn't want to complicate things any further.



Her mind was already racing. The six gemstones were her key to winning this bet.


As for Egbert... he never played by the rules.



She needed to figure out his angle-quietly, without revealing her own



Myron nodded. "I'll wait in the parking lot then."
She agreed without hesitation and got out of the car.



Myron drove down to park, his usual warmth vanishing as he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel.He then pulled out his phone and made a call.


After a few rings,someone answered.



"I need you to do something for me..." he said and then issued a series of instructions before hanging up.He looked through the windshield toward the Watson Group building, eyes focused.


Upstairs,Millie stepped into the CEO's office.


Brandon stood near his desk, his expression dark. As she walked in,he tossed a toy gun onto the desk.



On the other side of the room, Egbert approached with a smile.



"Millie. It's been a long time," he said, giving her a once-over. "You've changed since then."



She ignored the comment. "Why did you call me here today?"



"Oh, right." Egbert pulled a document from his briefcase and handed it to her. "Take a look. It's the contract you and Brandon signed back in Flesta when you came to find me."

There were traces of dried blood on it.



Millie's eyes lingered on the pages. That day in Flesta came rushing back.



Brandon had dived into freezing water to pull her out.She had looked Egbert in the eye and reminded him -"You gave me your word."



Now, years later, he repeated those words, more composed but no less calculating. "I gave you my word."



Under the office lights, the blood-stained contract looked even more striking.



Before Millie could take it, a hand reached out and grabbed it.



Brandon.



Just like that autumn day years ago, when he held her close and signed that contract-his own hand soiled with her blood.



Now, he stood holding this very contract again,his eyes narrowed as he stared at Egbert.


Egbert met Brandon's gaze and flashed him a smile.



"I've honored this contract all these years because of Millie," he said. "But now that you're divorced,I think  it's void."



He turned to Millie, smiling. "Just say the word, and I'll tear it up."



She didn't answer. She walked over to Brandon and took the contract from his hand.



She flipped through it. Clause after clause, each one a sharp edge forged during desperate negotiations.



Back then, they had won for the Watson Group. But it hadn't been her victory.



She had lost something invaluable instead.



Millie placed the contract on the table and looked across the room at Egbert, still smiling at her.


"Egbert Perez," she said, clearly and evenly



"Yes?" His eyes brightened. The charming smile masked something darker beneath. He looked like a knight awaiting his princess' orders.


But Millie knew better.



He wasn't a knight in shining armor. He was a devil in disguise.



"If you want to end the contract, find a better reason,"she said. "Don't use me as your excuse. And don't treat me like a pawn."



A flicker of shock crossed Egbert's face.



"Huh?" He sounded genuinely surprised.



Just like back then. He had always thought he was the one in control, only to find the game shifting beneath him.



The truth was, she had initiated that bet in Flesta.



Only the two of them knew the details.



Everyone else thought Egbert had forced her into it.They believed he'd manipulated her. But he hadn't.She had led him into it.



It was only the second time in his life he'd been caught off guard-and both times, it was because of her.



Back then, in the space of just fifteen minutes while Brandon was away, Millie had forced Egbert's hand.



She had stunned him three times in a row and eventually secured the contract.



Now, after years apart, she managed to catch him off -guard yet again-and still effortlessly so.



"I thought you hated him," Egbert said softly, glancing at Brandon. "I thought you'd want revenge."



Millie lowered her gaze, not answering.



"If you brought me here just to discuss this contract,"she said, "then I should make it clear. This is between the two of you. I was just a former employee at Watson Group. Now that I've left, you should resolve it yourselves."



She paused, and then added, "You can end the collaboration for any reason you like. Just don't involve me. Now excuse me, for I have other things to take care of."



With that, she turned to leave.



It wasn't that she didn't resent Brandon. She just refused to be Egbert's pawn.



She had come only to understand his intentions. Now that she had, she no longer wished to stay.



But as she reached the door, a hand caught her wrist.She turned.Brandon's eyes met hers. They were dark,intense.



"What really happened in Flesta during the fifteen minutes I was gone?" he asked.


Before she could speak, he added, "That year,we lost a child. That child was mine too. I have a right to know."
A sharp ache rose in Millie's chest. She pulled her hand away.



Her gaze dropped briefly to the contract on the table.



He used to say that Watson Group was their child too.That together, they could make it thrive.



He promised that he-and the comnpany-would always stand behind her.



But now,he wouldn't even return the Bennett family's possessions.


His promises had all become empty words.


So should she tell him what really happened that year?
###Chapter 167 Have You Ever Experienced A Single...
Millie's eyes drifted downward, her gaze heavy with resignation.



The moment had passed-any hope she'd harbored crumbled into dust.



Brandon had already surrendered his heart to someone else. So what if she told him the whole truth now?What earthly difference could it possibly make? Did she truly expect him to drown in guilt over her sacrifices?



The bitter reality struck her like a cold wave. If guilt possessed the power to restore what rightfully belonged to her, he never would have kept that tanzanite once he discovered its true significance.



Revealing everything now would only hand him another blade to twist deeper into her wounds.



She recognized the futility of lingering here any longer. Her life brimmed with urgent matters demanding attention.



The high-stakes wager with Vivian loomed ahead,and Ari's operation would arrive within days-these were  the battles that truly mattered.


She refused to squander another precious moment of thought on Brandon's betrayal.


Millie pulled her attention away from him and prepared to make her exit when Brandon's brow furrowed deeply, his body moving to follow her retreating form.



She released a harsh laugh, spinning toward Egbert with renewed purpose.



"Didn't you mention wanting to help me?" she demanded, her voice carrying an edge of steel. "Then prove it by holding him back."



Egbert's expression shifted to mild surprise before settling into polite understanding. "Consider it done."



He pivoted smoothly and drove his fist straight into Brandon's jaw.



The impact caught Brandon completely unprepared,sending him stumbling backward until he collided with the coffee table. The piece of furniture toppled under his weight, sending its collection of items cascading across the floor in a symphony of destruction.



The office door burst open with violent force.


 
"Mr.Watson!" Brandon!"



Eugene and Babette charged into the chaos, their eyes taking in the scene-Brandon sprawled across the floor while Egbert stood above him, flexing his knuckles with evident satisfaction as he smiled down at Millie.



Eugene scrambled forward to assist Brandon back to his feet.



Babette's fierce glare burned into Millie with unmistakable fury. "What exactly happened here?"


Millie's lips curved into a mocking smile. "Exactly what it appears to be."



Egbert flashed a gentlemanly smile in Millie's direction,his demeanor unruffled by the confrontation.



Babette's fury blazed even brighter at their casual attitudes.



"I've been meaning to address this with you," she snarled, her voice trembling with barely contained anger. "Don't you think common courtesy demands you inform us before orchestrating something this reckless? Do you have any comprehension of how utterly irresponsible this behavior is? The damage this could inflict on our company's reputation?"
Millie's attention shifted to Babette, her expression remaining unnervingly calm. "You're aware that Brandon and I have legally dissolved our marriage,aren't you?"



"And what relevance does that hold?" Babette snapped back.



"Did you discover this information through my social media post?" Millie pressed forward, her tone deceptively casual.



"Precisely," Babette responded, her voice tight as she wrestled to contain the fury burning within her chest.



"Then you must have noticed the date stamped on the document." Millie's words sliced through the air with arctic precision.



This time, Babette's mouth remained sealed, her defiance crumbling under the weight of the question.



Millie's gaze drifted toward Brandon, who was roughly shoving Eugene's helping hands away as he struggled to his feet, his expression dark as a storm cloud.


"Choosing not to announce it publicly on the very day we finalized the divorce was already an act of compassion on my part. Therefore, Babette," Millie pronounced each syllable with crystalline precision."Direct your indignation toward the appropriate target.
I refuse to serve as your emotional punching bag."



Babette's complexion blazed crimson at Millie's cutting words. Her lips parted to launch a counterattack, but Millie's voice sliced through her attempt.



"Do we have an understanding?" Millie's tone remained soft as silk, yet it carried the weight of an unspoken threat.



She maintained an appearance of perfect composure,though her eyes had transformed into glacial pools of warning.



The sight sent an involuntary shiver racing down Babette's spine, penetrating straight to her core.



For one terrifying heartbeat, she found herself absolutely convinced that any further provocation would result in consequences far beyond her imagination.



The strangest part was her absolute certainty that Millie possessed both the capability and the resolve to follow through.



During that fleeting instant of distraction, Millie had already severed their eye contact with calculated indifference.



She cast one final glance at Brandon, who was  dabbing away the crimson evidence of Egbert's punch,and then pivoted on her heel and strode toward the exit with unwavering determination.



Brandon lurched forward, desperate to pursue her retreating figure, but Egbert materialized in his path like an immovable fortress, still massaging his right knuckles while wearing that infuriating smile.



Beyond the officewalls, the sharp staccato rhythm of Millie's heels grew fainter with each passing second,while inside the room, the two men remained locked in their silent standoff.



Eugene stood frozen in bewildered helplessness,while Babette's eyes blazed scarlet as she fixed Egbert with a venomous stare. Finally, desperation drove her to bolt from the room in a futile attempt to intercept Millie.



But destiny had already sealed her fate-she would never catch up.



Millie had already disappeared behind the closing elevator doors, and the mechanical hum signaled its swift descent toward the ground floor.



As the elevator completed its descent,Millie emerged from the Watson Group building's gleaming lobby,but rather than disappearing into the bustling street,she planted herself just outside the main entrance.
Roughly sixty seconds ticked by before another elevator announced its arrival with a soft chime,and Egbert stepped into view.



He crossed the threshold of the building and immediately spotted Millie's silhouette waiting in the distance.



Without hesitation, he navigated the space between them with purposeful strides.



"Care to spare a minute for me?" Egbert inquired, his voice carrying genuine interest.



Millie's eyes swept toward the space where Myron's car sat waiting before she gestured toward a nearby area where fewer people wandered through their afternoon routines.



The two figures came to rest in comfortable stillness.



"Why did you do it?" Egbert's voice carried the weight of genuine curiosity.



Millie understood exactly what he was asking, but she chose to sidestep his question entirely. Instead, she allowed her gaze to travel deliberately over his form,studying him with calculating interest.



"Egbert," she began, her voice steady and probing "Why are you here?"
Egbert maintained his silence, his attention fixed solely upon her face as if memorizing every subtle expression.


"Please don't feed me some fabricated story about discovering my divorce and rushing back to capitalize on that opportunity. Your overseas ventures were flourishing magnificently." Millie refused to break eye contact."There's absolutely no logical reason for you to abandon that success and plunge yourself into this tangled web of complications. If my instincts serve me correctly, something significant must have unraveled in Flesta-isn't that the truth?"



Egbert finally allowed laughter to escape his lips, rich and knowing. He shook his head slowly as the sound faded. "Remarkably perceptive, as always. Your mind remains as razor-sharp as ever."



His hand disappeared into his jacket pocket and emerged holding a miniature wooden sculpture,expertly carved to capture the elegant form of a fox in perfect detail.



"This belongs to you now," he announced, extending the gift toward her. "Consider it a symbol of our enduring friendship. I believe it captures your essence quite perfectly."



Millie stretched out her hand and accepted the offering with careful fingers.
The fox truly possessed remarkable craftsmanship,every detail lovingly rendered, and she could tell immediately that he had carved it with his own skilled hands, just like that exquisite bottle of wine she remembered.



"I had every intention of presenting that wine to you personally," he revealed, seeming to anticipate the direction of her thoughts. "Unfortunately, Babette intercepted my plans before I could execute them properly."



Egbert studied her face intently. "What do you think?"


Millie continued examining the wooden fox, offering no definitive response to his question.



Golden sunlight caressed the elegant lines of her profile, yet he detected the profound melancholy that lurked beneath her lowered lashes.



He recognized that her thoughts had drifted once again toward that precious child she lost.



He spoke with quiet conviction. "| invested tremendous effort in the years that followed."



Millie's attention remained focused upon the intricate details of the wooden fox.



"Exactly as you advised me, I abandoned my frivolous  ways and began genuinely pursuing the dreams that mattered, the goals | wanted to command, and learning to love and shield the people who held importance in my heart. The transformation demanded considerable time and patience. Many,many years of dedicated work."



He smiled, though his eyes betrayed an ocean of sorrow.



He pressed forward with his confession. "But despite all my searching and growth, I never succeeded in finding that person you described, Millie. Throughout that entire deep autumn season, and in all the seasons that followed, the person you spoke of with such certainty never actually materialized in my life, not from beginning to end."



Millie's gaze abandoned the wooden fox and settled upon a patch of ground at her feet.



The sun maintained its brilliant intensity overhead, yet darkness seemed to pool within her eyes.


"The words I spoke earlier inside the Watson Group weren't completely fabricated," Egbert admitted with raw honesty. "I've never harbored any genuine concern about Brandon or his welfare. All these years of conducting business with the Watson Group,negotiating renewals and maintaining professional relationships, every single interaction was motivated  entirely by you. That fateful wager we made years ago altered the entire trajectory of my existence. So now I must ask you the same question."



He studied Millie with focused intensity, ensuring that no fleeting micro-expression escaped his notice.



"Did you ultimately obtain everything your heart desired? Do you still carry that same unwavering determination that once defined you?" he asked with growing intensity.



His eyes took on a reddish tinge as he lowered his voice to barely above a whisper. "Throughout all these passing years, have you ever experienced a single moment of genuine regret?"
###Chapter 168 Press Conference
Talking about the past now was pointless.What once was no longer mattered.



All Millie could say was that her love had been sincere.And when she chose to take it back, that decision had been just as sincere.



She looked at the wooden fox carving in her hand.



A fox?



Was that how Egbert saw her?



But she had never been sly or cunning.



She had only ever given her heart. And now, that heart was worn thin.



She held out the carving to Egbert, but he didn't take it.



"Keep it," he said softly. "Since I've come back, I should at least offer you something. I carved it myself.It's not worth much, but you can come to me one day with it and make a request."
He smiled. "Anything you want from me. Even if it means giving you everything I have-my life included."


Over the years,he had come to understand something.It wasn't that he had never met the one he loved-it was that she had once stood before him, and he simply hadn't realized it. 1


And back then, she had belonged to someone else.



Luckily for him, she was now free. And so was he. It gave him hope.



Millie only smiled.



She let out a quiet sigh and placed the carving back in his hand. "What would I do with your life? Keep it."


She didn't want to get caught up in tangled feelings again. One Brandon had been enouggh.



Egbert looked like he wanted to speak, but a shadow fell over them.



It was Myron.



He smiled at Egbert, and then turned to Millie.



"You two have been talking for a while. Thought I'd come over," he said.



"Who do you think you are to-" Egbert's tone was  sharp at first, but then he stopped when he turned and saw the newcomer.He studied Myron's face."It's you?"His eyes moved between the two of them, confused.



Myron didn't answer.



He took Millie's hand and gently pushed Egbert's away the fox still in it.



"Look," Myron said. "If she doesn't want it, don't force it. That's just disrespectful."



His voice stayed calm, but the message was clear.



Egbert's face darkened. He looked like he had more to say,but Myron was already holding Millie's hand.



"Let's go," Myron said. "Isn't Ari's class about to finish?It's time to pick her up."



Egbert's gaze dropped to their joined hands.


Millie fought the urge to laugh and gave a small nod.


"You're right," she said before turning to Egbert."Enjoy your time back home."



"You two-" Egbert began, but they were already walking away. He stood there, unsure of what had just happened.



In the car, Millie fastened her seatbelt.
"You know him?" she asked.



"We've met through business," Myron said as he started the engine.



The drive was quiet and smooth. Soon, they reached Ari's school.



Millie was unbuckling her seatbelt when Myron spoke."We said we'd meet twelve times, just the two of us,"he reminded her. "Let's start the day after tomorrow.What do you think?"



A flicker of unease passed through him



She had just finalized her divorce, and already others were circling. He didn't want to fall behind.



Millie was surprised but remembered her promise.


After thinking it over, she smiled. "Alright."







At Watson Group, Brandon looked grim.



Eugene had just called a doctor to treat the bruises on his face.



Phone calls kept coming in from abroad.



Shareholders were demanding answers.
Reporters had already gathered outside the building.Online, rumors were spreading fast.



"Mr. Watson," Eugene said carefully, "everyone's asking when the press conference will begin. They're waiting for a statement."



If it wasn't an emergency, he wouldn't have risked souring Brandon's mood further.


Brandon stayed silent, his eyes shut.


All he could see was Millie. That distant expression on her face. That easy warmth she shared with Egbert.



The jealousy burned.



He clenched his right hand.



"Mr. Watson?" Eugene asked again.



"In half an hour," Brandon finally said. "Use the third conference room."



Only then did Eugene let out a breath."Understood."







Soon after, a new post appeared online. "Brandon Watson will hold a press conference in thirty minutes to address divorce-related issues."

The news spread fast.


Some were there for the gossip. Others worried about how it would affect the company's future.


Even Egbert, who rarely paid attention to such things,found himself watching the stream



Time moved quickly. The moment arrived.



Inside the building, Vivian stood beside Brandon. "Are you sure about this?" she asked quietly."Is now really the right time?"



Babette was less diplomatic. She was enraged."Why does Millie get to vanish while you're left cleaning up the mess?" 1



Brandon gave her a cold glance.



Vivian hesitated, and then asked, "Do you want me to come with you?"



"No," he said.



He opened the door and stepped into the conference room.



It was packed with reporters. Flashbulbs went off the moment he entered.



Meanwhile,at the Elliott Mansion,Millie sat with Ari After picking the girl up, Myron had suggested stopping by his place so she could play with his cat Ari was excited, so Millie agreed to bring her along



The television in the room was playing Brandon's press conference.



"Yes, Millie and I have finalized our divorce," Brandon said. His voice was calm. "We signed a prenuptial agreement when we married, so there's no billion-dollar stock split like everyone so feared of."



He paused. "And while we are officially separated, the asset division is still ongoing. Updates will follow. As for the partnerships Millie managed, Watson Group will appoint successors shortly. There's no cause for concern."



The cameras continued to flash. Reporters readied their questions.


"Mr. Watson," one asked, "can you tell us the reason for the divorce? We noticed the timing overlaps with your frequent public appearances alongside Vivian.Was she involved?"



Brandon's eyes narrowed.



Before he could respond, another voice spoke up. "Mr.Watson, what exactly did Millie take with her? You said the asset division was still ongoing. Wasn't this supposed to be agreed on and done before the divorce was finalized?"
###Chapter 169 Brandon Is A Scumbag
The scene was chaotic. Reporters jostled for space,while a flood of viewers watched the live stream online,all waiting for Brandon to speak.



Outside the conference room, Vivian kept a nervous eye on Brandon, while Millie watched Ari, who was fixated on Myron's cat. All the while, Brandon's reply lingered in their ears.



Under the flashing lights, Brandon finally broke his silence.



He said, "About the first question-yes, there are feelings between Vivian and me. But my divorce from Millie was a mutual decision, and it has nothing to do with Vivian. About the second question, there are disagreements in some parts of the asset division and it may end up in court. So I can't say what exactly will be taken or left behind."



He paused for a moment, and then added, "But like I said before, we signed a prenuptial agreement to protect the company's structure, so there won't be any complications about the shares."



The press didn't let up. Cameras clicked, capturing  every word. Brandon's response and his defense of Vivian were already all over the Internet.



Millie watched Brandon from the screen



That night, it was obvious he had forced the decision of a divorce on his own. She had asked him repeatedly but all he said was, "Don't make me think you're being heartlesS."



So this was his version of"mutual decision."


And still, he never once gave a straight answer about whether Vivian was the reason their divorce.



All those days and nights spent holding each other through grief and joy. Years of sacrifice and survival.And now, it seemed, none of it mattered. Not next to someone he'd known less than a year.


A reporter said again through the buzz,"Mr.Watson,based on what you've said, is Millie walking away with nothing?"



This was very sensitive.


Millie and Brandon had been together for years, and everyone in Crobert knew that. It wasn't some quiet affair or rumor without weight; they were legally married.



Being a loyal partner, Millie had stood by him through  the roughest times.


With all eyes on him, Brandon lowered his face slightly.


"Once the legal process is done, everything will be made public," he said.



The reporters made to ask more questions, but Brandon signaled that the press conference was over.



"Mr. Watson! Just one more..."



"Please,Mr.Watson!"



Brandon didn't stop. His team closed in,and he walked away without another word.



Behind the flash of lights, shareholders let out small sighs of relief. At least for now, it looked like the market might hold. But no one could predict what tomorrow would bring.



The only thing clear was that the Internet had erupted,buzzing with arguments and opinions.



Most of the noise circled around how Millie and Brandon's assets would be split.



"Seven years together and she didn't even get a dime?"



"Even regular employees get severance after seven years of loyal service; how much more someone who was his wife!"



"He's planning to toss her aside with a small check and a press statement? Money means little to Brandon.With shares in hand, he'd make it all back before anyone could blink. The real power in the Watson Group lies in the shares."



"Brandon is such a scumbag."



"A real scumbag."



"I can't stand him."



"Y'all see the bruise on his face? I don't care how he got it; he deserved worse."



The outrage grew, fast and loud.



At the Elliott residence, Myron clicked the remote,switching off the live feed. The room fell silent.


Millie looked at Myron,who stood nearby.



He stood by the screen, face heavy, the usual mischief gone from his eyes. What was left was sadness.



"Let it go-it's all in the past now," he said softly."The road ahead is still long."



Millie glanced at Myron in front of her.
Somehow, he always knew when something weighed on her mind. And when he offered his comforting words and gestures, they were genuinely soothing.



It was nothing like the connection she had shared with Brandon. With Brandon, it had always been about building something together-pushing, planning,enduring.



But Myron always showed up when the noise was too much. He rarely said much, but the little he did was enough to steady her.



If this were years ago, when her heart was still soft and untouched, she might have dreamed of an intense love.



But now, after all the heartbreak and storms, what she longed for was a simple and warm relationship.



"What's on your mind?" Myron asked gently.



Millie shook her head.



She felt like she had seen him before. Not in business circles, but somewhere else.


"Little kitty-" Ari quickly took the chance while the ragdoll cat was distracted and scooped it into a hug.



The cat, large and chubby, looked like it was trying to wriggle free without much effort. Its paws hovered over Ari, its wide eyes staring at the two adults as if begging for help.


The cat let out a soft meow of protest while Ari held it close, rolling around together.



Millie and Myron, who were watching, both wore smilés on their faces.







Time passed quickly.



Vivian and Brandon had finished their dinner.



By the time Brandon drove her back to her studio, the sky was fully dark.



They barely spoke on the journey



Brandon stared out the window, lost in his own world.Beside him, Vivian was busy exchanging messages with Oakley under her alternate profile.



They had discussed many things. Then she sent her final message for the night. "Whether we can make a big haul this time depends on how you and I handle it!"


Vivian then locked her phone and put it away.


 
She turned to Brandon; watching his face,she  hesitated for a second and then softened her voice."Brandon."



Brandon glanced back at her.


"I'll help you," Vivian said earnestly. "Whatever she could do, I can do too. Maybe even better."



Brandon didn't respond. He simply looked at her.



Vivian smiled. "Just trust me."



But Brandon wasn't looking at Vivian. In his mind's eye,it was Millie he saw-Millie gripping his hand as they faced crises, Millie standing at his side when no one else believed in them.



But now, they were merely strangers to each other.



He remembered the cold,determined look in her eyes when she stared at him at his office earlier that day.



Brandon's chest tightened with sorrow.



He had done this. And now, if it weren't for the pressure from getting back what her father had left her or the bet she had with Vivian, Millie wouldn't even be in his orbit anymore.



He wondered for a fleeting moment if he had taken the wrong path. But regret was useless now. He had gone too far to turn back.
All he could do was cling to the Bennett family's properties and keep her bound to him.



It was the only path left.



The car sped through the night toward Vivian Floral Design.


At that same moment, a fresh wave of gossip hit the entertainment	news	with the hashtag	#MyronDatingMysteryWoman



The photo showed a pair of figures from behind,standing by the river. Myron was gently placing a coat over an unknown woman's shoulders.



The river breeze tugged at her long hair, and her face was turned away, hidden under the night. But it wasn't her face the Internet fixated on.



It was the way Myron looked at her-softly, fully, like she was the only person in the world. Even in the dim light, the tenderness in his eyes couldn't be mistaken.

###Chapter 170 Brandon Should Really Learn From...
That day, Crobert's two most prominent business figures made headlines for very different reasons-one known for his philandering, the other admired for his quiet grace.



The top comment online read, "Brandon should really learn from Myron."



Brandon's repoutation had hit rock bottom. Rumors swirled that the Flesta consortium was considering pulling out of its agreement.



Public sentiment spiraled fast, and panic gripped the market. Shareholders rushed to place sell orders overnight,preparing to exit at the first sign of collapse.



The situation seemed beyond repair. And yet,the city pulsed with quiet, unspoken tension.



After dropping Ari off at the children's home, Myron drove Millie home.



He considered walking her to her door but held back.



They weren't together yet, and until she gave the green light, it wouldn't be right.
He smiled warmly. "Let's stick to what we discussed.We'll go over everything else tomorrow."



Millie nodded and waved as she stepped out of the car.



They had already reached an understanding earlier that day at the Elliott Group's secret vault. Later, as they watched Ari played with the cat at his place, they went over their plans and prepared for what was ahead.



Tomorrow, once the market opened, Watson Group's stock would plummet.


Two outcomes were likely.



One: the company's market value would nosedive.



Two: Watson Group would scramble to recover,prompting desperate countermeasures.



But Crobert's regulations were stricter than in many other places.



Actions had to follow the rules. The consequences for overstepping could be serious.



"Good night," Myron said."I'll stay here and watch you go in."



Millie gave a nod and entered the building.
As she got inside the elevator,her emotions stirred-part anticipation, part uncertainty.



"Ding!" She reached her floor, stepped inside her apartment, and walked to the balcony.


From there, she saw the Bentley still parked below.He was standing beside it, looking up at her.


She waved.



"I'm home," she texted.



"Got it," he replied with a voice message, his tone soft.



They didn't exchange more. He stayed there,gazing up. She stood above, looking down.



After a while, he said, "Go inside. The wind is picking up and it's cold on the balcony."



Only after watching her disappear from view did he drive away.



Millie remained by the window, watching until his car was gone.



Once,she had waited like this for Brandon. Night after night.



Now...
It felt strangely comforting to be on the other side.


As she washed her face, that thought stayed with her It grounded her.



Then, sitting on the couch, she made a call.



Charles answered quickly.



He had been dealing with rising tensions inside the Evans family.Since Serena had been revealed as Millie and Millie had won the championship, Heavenly Melody surged in popularity. Charles' value had grown,which made Reuben and Oakley increasingly uneasy Trouble kept brewing.



"Hey, Millie," he said with a sigh, slumping onto his sofa.



"Did you see the news today?" she asked, turning on her TV.



"Don't even bringit up," Charles grumbled. "Brandon is unreal. So obsessed with Vivian. Why doesn't he just tattoo her name across his forehead?"



Millie smiled.



Charles had always been emotional and impulsive, but he was loyal. No matter what happened, he stood by his friends.
Listening to his rant lightened her mood.



When he finally paused, she changed the subject.



"I need your help with something," she said.



"Just say the word," Charles replied at once



She hesitated for a second, and then explained,"Tomorrow, I want you to watch the Evans family closely-especially Oakley's financial movements."



"Why him?" Charles asked. "Oakley's involved in all sorts of things. He invests across the board, and he's never tried to hide it."



"I know. It's just one possibility I'm watching. I'LL explain later," she said.


"All right. I'll keep an eye out," Charles said,sitting up.He knew Millie didn't act without reason.



Moreover...



He was fed up with Oakley's scheming. Lately,it seemed like the man was constantly setting traps just for him. It was timne to strike back.


Charles narrowed his eyes. "Oakley, if you cross the line..." he muttered to himself.



After ending the call, Millie reviewed her plans and notes before heading to bed.



Sleep wouldn't come easily for many tonight.



All over the city, different forces were on the move.Crobert's three major players were holding emergency meetings, and smaller groups were also maneuvering behind the scenes.



Brandon was wrapping up final communications,locking in agreements, and preparing contingency plans for the morning.



Even if the stock price dropped, as long as partners stayed, the prenuptial terms held, and product quality remained, then Watson Group might still recover.


The scandal was personal. The foundation of the company was sound.



At dawn, Brandon stood by the window in his office.



He rubbed his temples, drained. It had been along time since he felt this worn out.



When Millie was still around, he felt like he could do anything. No matter how hard the day, he believed things would turn out fine.



Now, he could still do what needed to be done. But the spark was gone.
She wasn't here. Neither was the coffee she used to make for him.



He closed his eyes. His right hand curled into a fist.



He told himself that she would come back.



Once this storm passed, once everything was under control, she would return. Everything would go back to how it was.







As morning broke, the city held its breath.


Everyone was watching the stock market.


Millie had dropped Ari off at kindergarten and now sat in front of her computer, waiting.



Charles quietly passed instructions to his team,initiating a set of targeted moves.



In his study, Myron poured a fresh cup of coffee and waited in silence.



Brandon sat in his sleek office, composed.


At Vivian Floral Design, Vivian adjusted her makeup.She looked delicate yet striking. She looked at her reflection and gave a small nod.
Everyone was ready.



The market opened.



A single refresh told the story. "Watson Group Market Value Drops by Hundreds of Billions on Opening."



Both the financial and entertainment headlines had been overtaken by this one shared reality.
###Chapter 171 Since When Did Brandon Start Pulling Suc...

Countless voices filled the air with complaints and regrets,while a few saw the chaos as an opportunity.


Everyone was moving quickly, making their own moves.





Millie stayed silent, calmly watching from the sidelines as she waited for the expected signal.


Time dragged on as various parties engaged in a battle of wits.



The bidding came to an end, and then the early trading session began.



The Watson Group's stock continued to plummet.



Their phones were getting blown up with frantic calls from panicked shareholders desperate for answers.



Derek and Norma watched the disaster play out with growing irritation.



"I knew from the start that Brandon divorcing Millie would bring him to this. Isn't this just karma?" Derek snapped,thudding his cane on the floor in anger.
Norma let out a deep sigh."You still have to deal with the aftermath. No matter how mad you are at Brandon,you can't just sit back and let the Watson Group crumble."



"That little brat knows exactly what he's doing, and he's doing it to mess with me!" Derek shouted, fuming.







Meanwhile, in the shadows, a figure moved into action,instructing their team with precision.



They began sweeping up shares, buying them in large volumes.


When the numbers were just about right, he picked up a phone and made a call.


On the other end, Vivian glanced at the secret phone.



It rang three times and then went silent.



She smiled to herself.



At 9:35 AM, while furious investors flooded the Internet with curses, blaming Brandon and dragging his entire family to filth,Vivian went live.



Because of Brandon's current infamy, and since she was closely connected to him, her stream immediately exploded with viewers.
Eugene rushed into Brandon's office.



"Mr. Watson, Miss Simpson just went live," Eugene reported, breathless and anxious. "This wasn't part of the plan. WVhat is she trying to do?"



Brandon's expression darkened as he reached for his phone and dialed her number. But Vivian didn't pick up.She stayed on air.



No one had seen this coming, not Millie, Charles,or Myron.



Everyone's attention turned to Vivian's live broadcast.



On screen, she appeared with teary eyes, looking delicate and vulnerable.



She looked straight into the camera and said softly,"I never thought the rumors about Brandon,Millie,and me wvould affect Watson Group's stock this much.


That was never what I wanted." She dabbed at her eyes and added, "When I saw the stock price crash,I felt I had to clarify things."



Brandon turned to Eugene. "Go find her and make her stop!"



Without hesitation, Eugene rushed out.


They had worked through the night, reaching out to countless contacts, negotiating endlessly, trying to keep different sides in balance, even making a few reluctant compromises.



Every angle had been considered and every move had been mapped out. They had a thorough plan in place.


As one of Crobert's top three powerhouses, backed by a team of sharp minds, they couldn't-and definitely wouldn't-just sit still. They had to find a way forward.



Vivian hadn't been part of their plan, and her sudden livestream could easily unravel everything.


Meanwhile,Millie watched the livestream, blinking in confusion.



"So this is it, Brandon? After I left the Watson Group,your brilliant move was sending Vivian to play the victim and win people's sympathy?" she muttered.


She couldn't believe he would go that far.


Millie was baffled, but decided to keep watching.



Back on the stream, Vivian had calmed herself and continued talking. "Everyone knows I don't have much time left... So, whatever there is between Brandon and I won't ruin his marriage."

 
She gave a faint, sorrowful smile. "I won't be around much longer anyway. But since everyone seems so invested in the rumors, I'll explain everything today.There was never anything inappropriate between me and Brandon. Everything happened because I..."



She sniffed and continued, "I told Brandon | didn't have much time left. I admitted that I liked him and asked if he could spend my last six months with me.Not as lovers, just... as someone by my side, doing the things I still wanted to experience with me. At first,he turned me down. He had made it clear, time and time again, that he and Millie shared a strong bond,and he had no intention of betraying his marriage. But when my health declined further, and maybe because I'd once helped him, things turned out the way they did.He divorced Millie because he didn't want her thinking he was being unfaithful. The truth is, his feelings for me aren't that deep. Maybe after I'm gone, he and Millie will find their way back to each other. I can't say for sure. This livestream, by the way, is something l decided to do on my own. He is completely unaware of it. I hadn't planned to speak out like this, especially since I've only got five months left. But watching the Watson Group's stock plummet over this... I couldn't bear the guilt." 1



Vivian let out a dry cough on camera. As she brought a tissue to her lips, the viewers caught a glimpse of the bloodstain.


 
She quickly tucked the tissue out of sight, as if she  didn't want the audience to see it.



With a faint, bitter smile, she said, "The business partners aren't pulling out. There's no outrageous divorce settlement. Honestly, Brandon and I never even shared a bed. If the stock keeps fluctuating because of rumors like this, then it's really-"



Just then, a knock came at the door, and Vivian turned her head,startled.



Then,the stream abruptly cut off.



At the doorway, Eugene stood out of breath, staring at her.



"Miss Simpson, you can't make moves like this without running it by us first!" he snapped,struggling to hold back his exasperation.



Vivian feigned an apologetic look and said, "I'm sorry.I just thought I could help."


She then gestured toward a graph on the screen nearby. "See? It's working. The stock price is starting to bounce back."



Eugene nearly rolled his eyes. The recovery had nothing to do with her. It was clearly the result of their plan finally kicking in. But he didn't dare say anything too harsh. All he could do was take Vivian back with him to the Watson Group.
Sure enough, the company's stock price had started to climb again.



That much was expected since Brandon had a plan and just like any other publicly traded firm, they had professionals in place to handle this kind of situation.



However, Vivian's little stunt had set off waves of gossip across the industry.



To those who didn't know the fulI story, she might have seemed pitiful. But to others, she came off as nothing more than a joke.



Charles burst out laughing and turned to Millie. "Did you hear? Brandon's become the laughingstock of the entire industry! It's ridiculous! Since when did he start pulling such cheap tricks? Hlonestly, it's killing me. My stomach hurts from laughing."



Millie couldn't believe it either.



The overblown divorce rumors had already been cleared up the day before. There was never such a case to begin with.



The real reason behind the wave of panic that tanked the stock was a rumor that one of the Watson Group's biggest partners was about to pull out, with others supposedly following suit and pulling out as well.
But Egbert had only gone to give Brandon a scare yesterday.



The contract had already been signed, and pulling out wasn't something that could be done on a whim. At most,they might choose not to renew it when the time came.



That was exactly why Millie had told Egbert not to drag her name into the matter.



The Watson Group had a strong foundation in technology, and they got the contract back then only because they overcame technological barriers first.



So even if Brandon had truly behaved like a jerk to his wife, his personal life had little to do with his professional one. While it could shake investor confidence a little, it wasn't enough to cause significant damage.



As long as the company stayed on top of things,the stock price would bounce back.



But now, the situation had taken a strange turn.



Vivian's stunt was embarrassing, so much so that it was hard to even talk about.



Was this what Brandon had become without Millie by his side?
That thought echoed throughout the industry.



And what most people didn't yet realize was that Vivian's actions had opened the door to a whole new wave of trouble.
###Chapter 172 Get Vivian Out Of Watson Group!
At Watson Group headquarters, Brandon pressed his fingers to his temples, his eyes fixed on Vivian acroSS the desk.



Brandon's voice was ice-cold as he asked, "What were you thinking?"



Vivian blinked at Brandon, bewildered. What was the problem?



Wasn't it her livestream that had supposedly turned things around, saving the company's stock from total collapse?



She was certain she'd done the Watson Group a favor.She was the reason for the sudden recovery,not Millie or anyone else.



All these years, Millie had never wielded this kind of influence. Only Vivian managed to stir up such a dramatic effect.



Still, she couldn't say that outright, so she masked herself with a pained, innocent expression. "Brandon,when I saw the Watson Group's market value nosedive this morning, I thought I had to do something fast to help."



But Brandon's frosty glare didn't soften.



Eugene,standing to the side, finally spoke up, unable to stay quiet. "Miss Simpson, you can't just act on your own. These are major company decisions. You need to coordinate with us first."



A flicker of irritation crossed Vivian's face, but she quickly hid it. She'd harbored a grudge against Eugene for ages, and once she secured her place as Brandon's wife, she fully intended to make him pay.


For now, however, she had to play along.


"I... I saw the news and just went live without thinking,"Vivian stammered, dropping her gaze and biting her lip."Anyway,everything turned out fine, didn't it?"



Eugene cast a frustrated glance her way. "That's only because the entire company worked through the night, and Mr. Watson never left the boardroom. We had a plan from the start."



Vivian fell silent, her eyes downcast.



No one seemed to notice the bitterness simmering just beneath her meek facade.


Brandon, however, never looked away, his cold stare stil locked on Vivian.
It dawned on him that he'd acted without thinking things through.



He'd grown used to the effortless partnership he shaed with Millie, where every project ran smoothly,their instincts perfectly in sync.



Half the time, a single glance or a brief smile was enough for them to understand each other's thoughts.



Moments like today's fiasco simply never happened when Millie was around. Because she knew that, when it came to a public company, nothing mattered more than building trust through dependable, high-quality products.



Sure, Watson Group ran flashy ad campaigns and brought on big-name endorsements, but at the end of the day, their technology was their real backbone.



Brandon noticed the dissatisfaction in Vivian's eyes,feeling under pressure. But in the end, he decided to let it slide.



Vivian just didn't get how these things worked.


Still,something nagged at him.


"Do you personally own any Watson Group stock?"Brandon asked, his tone cold.
Huh?" Vivian stared,puzzled.



Eugene cut in, his voice serious, "Miss Simpson, this is a serious matter. What you did could be viewed as manipulating the stock price, especially if you purchased shares when they were at their lowest..."


Eugene trailed off, but the threat was obvious.



"This could have major legal consequences," he added.



Depending on the circumstances, she could be facing jail time or at least a hefty fine.


Vivian shot Eugene a sharp look, but quickly replied,"No, I didn't buy any shares."


Brandon didn't take her at her word. Instead, he looked straight at Eugene. "Double-check it for me."


"Understood," Eugene answered at once.


"Brandon, I already told you l didn't buy any. Don't you trust me?" Vivian's voice edged with panic.



But Brandon met her gaze with a chilling calmness,so unlike the man she thought she knew.



The eerie composure in his eyes only made Vivian bristle with frustration. She continued, "You really don't have to go this far. I said on the livestream that I acted on my own, and you had no idea what I was doing."



Eugene let out a weary sigh. "Miss Simpson, do you honestly think anyone will believe that? You've brought up your relationship with Mr. Watson on public platforms more than once. The damage is already done, no matter what you say now."



"You-" Vivian shot him a glare, her patience fraying.


Yet in the end, she held her tongue.


At last, she threw up her hands in exasperation. "Fine,do whatever you need-I'll cooperate, all right?!Satisfied?"



She stormed out of the office, her angger trailing behind her.



Eugene hurried after her, leaving Brandon standing by the window, silently watching her retreat.



Just as Vivian reached the doorway, Brandon spoke,his tone flat. "From now on, Vivian, leave Watson Group matters to me. Don't get involved ever again."



That stung. Vivian stiffened, her back still to him.



"So, that's it? You're cutting me out?" she asked.



Brandon didn't bother to answer.
Eugene cut in, hoping to smooth things over, "Miss Simpson, that's not what Mr. Watson means. The company's business is complicated, and he's only looking out for you."


Vivian stayed silent, her hand tightening on the doorknob, the tension hanging in the air.



"Brandon, I just want to help you," she pleaded,turning around, eyes bright with tears. "If she could manage it, then why can't l? Maybe | made mistakes this time, but I'm still willing to do whatever it takes."



Brandon didn't meet Vivian's gaze. His eyes dropped,voice steady but distant. "Let's have dinner tonight."



A flash of satisfaction flickered across Vivian's face.



So this was how he chose to handle her, by giving in,yet again.



It was clear he still didn't know how to say no to her,so he let things slide.



Vivian gathered herself and, without another word,trailed after Eugene to take care of the verification.


Brandon was left alone in the vast CEO's office.



His eyes wandered to a small table in the corner.



Back then, whenever there was business to sort out,  Millie would claim that spot, settling in with a neat pile of paperwork at her side.



Now it sat empty and silent.



Then, the persistent buzz of his phone pulled him back.



Brandon checked the caller ID and picked up.



"Brandon!" Derek's voice exploded through the line,anger clear. "I put my neck on the line, making calls all night and smoothing things over for you, and this is what I get? You need to get Vivian out of Watson Group,now!"


One call ended, only to be followed by another. And another.



Brandon pressed his fingers to his temples, his gaze lingering on the empty side table nearby, a constant reminder of the mounting pressure he felt.



Elsewhere, Millie had watched the entire livestream unfold with steady composure, and then tracked the wild swings of the Watson Group's stock price on her screen.



After a moment's consideration, she dialed Charles.



He picked up quickly, and Millie got straight to the point. "What's the latest news?"
Excitement charged Charles's voice. "My contact confirmed it. He used several accounts to scoop up Watson Group shares at rock-bottom prices. The moment he finished, Vivian started her livestream. The timing lines up perfectly!"


Everything clicked for Charles at last.



Vivian and Oakley were definitely working together.They'd crossed paths in private several times even during the show Heavenly Melody.



If they could catch this ongoing scheme and nail down the evidence, it could finally give Charles the upper hand against Oakley.



Charles could finally deal a significant setback to Oakley!



Millie gave a soft laugh.


"We'll need hard evidence," Millie said, her tone steady. "Charles, track his finances and monitor any linked accounts for suspicious activity."



Charles agreed immediately.


They didn't need to say more. Their unspoken understanding was clear.



They knew that,even with concrete proof of Oakley and Vivian's collaboration, the punishment would probably amount to littlemore than a fine. Still, it would deal a heavy blow to both their reputations.



Millie never set out to go after someone already on their way out, but the moment she agreed to that wager with Vivian, a clash became unavoidable.


Truth be told, Vivian had brought all of this on herself.


After ending the call, Millie glanced once more at the fluctuating stock chart on her screen.



Her father's advice drifted through her thoughts."Millie, until you have the power to make the rules,your job is to follow them and turn them to your advantage."



Millie's gaze dropped, her eyes softening.



For a moment, she found herself missing her father all over again.
###Chapter 173 The Ache Of Missing Her

Millie had absorbed countless lessons from her father,yet they represented merely a whisper of his vast knowledge.



Her father wielded an unshakeable composure, as though every thread of fate danced within his grasp.



Regardless of how desperate circumstances became,he wielded an uncanny ability to discover unexpected pathways toward the most favorable resolutions.



His presence alone served as an impenetrable shield -no one would dare harass Millie while he drew breath.



None possessed the courage, because back then, she was James' sole daughter, the destined heiress of the illustrious Bennett legacy.



But death had stolen her father away.



He had plunged from that towering edifice,his body crashing to the pavement directly before her horrified eyes.



His departure struck with brutal swiftness, and he departed this world without achieving serenity.



That nightmarish image carved itself into her memory,jolting her awake from sleep after sleep, drenched in cold sweat and gasping for air.


Millie's fingers curled into a trembling fist, her knuckles whitening with determination.



She would reclaim every asset that rightfully belonged to the Bennett empire and drag the truth about her father's murder into the harsh light of justice.



She had to succeed-failure wasn't an option.




···


The Watson Group's stock value began its gradual ascent from the depths. Though the numbers still glowed crimson with loss, the devastating free-fall had finally stabilized into a more manageable decline.



Strategic public announcements followed in rapid succession,each carefully crafted statement breathing new life into investor confidence. The stock price found its footing on steadier ground. Most remarkably,not a single major partner had severed ties with the Watson Group during this turbulent period,demonstrating remarkable loyalty that convinced many analysts the stock would eventually surge back to its former heights.
Hours melted away, and soon the midday trading bell silenced the markets.



Financial experts seized the moment to dissect the unfolding drama for their eager audiences.



"Currently, the Watson Group's products,manufacturing standards, and business relationships appear completely sound. This publicly traded corporation clearly possesses its own methods for navigating turbulent waters. Nevertheless, I remain deeply intrigued about their strategy for addressing Vivian's explosive allegations."



"I'm eager to interview Brandon's former wife, Millie.After all, she weathered seven tumultuous years alongside the Watson Group and witnessed previous stock market earthquakes. I'm fascinated to discover how they navigated those earlier storms."



Meanwhile, the captivated spectators found themselves utterly absorbed by Vivian's explosive livestream revelations.



"Vivian claimed she and Brandon never shared physical intimacy. Could that possibly be accurate?"


"Nobody can say for certain at this point."



"If Vivian's testimony proves accurate and they maintained a purely platonic relationship, then  perhaps she isn't the home-wrecker we imagined-just someone who made unreasonable demands."



"But what about Brandon's cryptic response? He admitted it before that there were feelings between him and Vivian. Is that mere gratitude? Maybe appreciation? Either way, it feels deliberately vague and evasive, yet it practically confirmed he divorced Millie because of this entire mess."



"Exactly my thoughts."



"I'm dying to see how this soap opera reaches its grand finale."








Meanwhile, after wrestling with an avalanche of corporate crises, Brandon found himself facing Eugene's simple question about lunch preferences.



But hunger had abandoned Brandon entirely, leaving him feeling hollow and restless. He mumbled something about wanting to stretch his legs downstairs and told Eugene to order whatever seemed appealing.



Eugene opened his mouth to protest, but then thought better of it and simply clamped his lips shut.



The assistant had endured his own hellish day. After sacrificing sleep to navigate the company's treacherous waters, Vivian's theatrical performance had driven him perilously close to his breaking point.


Well,since Brandon had granted him carte blanche for meal selection, Eugene decided to indulge in something luxuriously expensive that would satisfy his own refined tastes-two servings, one designated for Brandon and one for himself. Should Brandon's appetite fail to materialize, he would savor both servings with guilty pleasure!



Brandon summoned his private elevator with a weary press of the button.



The gleaming doors slid open with mechanical precision, and after a moment of internal debate, his finger hovered over a specific floor selection before pressing down with quiet resolve.



"Ding." The elevator completed its swift journey and announced its arrival.



Brandon emerged from the compartment without making a sound.



This particular floor buzzed with frenetic energy-employees juggling phone calls while weaving between workstations, their voices creating a symphony of professional stress. 
Several employees offered respectful greetings as he passed, though most remained completely absorbed in their critical tasks.



The constant symphony of ringing telephones echoed throughout the entire workspace.



This floor served as the nerve center for the company's market value management operations,while directly across the corridor stood the prestigious financial department that the Bennett family had established during their golden years of influence.



Every soul in sight moved with urgent purpose,their dedication palpable in the charged atmosphere.



As Brandon observed their relentless activity, Millie's ethereal presence seemed to materialize before his weary eyes like a phantom from happier times.



She had once graced these corridors frequently,weaving her strategic brilliance behind the scenes with masterful precision.



The question tormented him-had she witnessed today's explosive news coverage?



If she had observed his clumsy attempts at damnage control, what harsh judgment would she render?



Brandon found himself drowning in these troubling  thoughts.



Then a darker realization struck him with crushing force.Millie had probably witnessed Vivian's livestream spectacle instead of his corporate maneuvering.



His frustration blazed hotter, consuming what remained of his composure.



Perhaps she would find dark amusement in watching him stumble through such a seemingly straightforward crisis after her departure.



His mind drifted unbidden to those precious nights when nightmares would tear her from sleep, and she would seek sanctuary in his embrace while he whispered gentle reassurances against her trembling form until their hearts beat in perfect synchronization.



The ache of missing her struck his stomach like a physical blow, sharp and unrelenting.



"Brandon, what brings you to this chaos? Shouldn't you be heading to lunch?" A familiar voice sliced through his melancholic reverie and pulled him back to harsh reality.



He gathered his scattered composure and turned to find Babette approaching with quick, efficient strides.



"How are things progressing with the current situation?"Brandon deflected, steering the conversation toward safer professional territory.



Babette's expression curdled with disgust, her features contorting as though she had just swallowed something utterly vile and bitter.



"Thestock price has achieved temporary stability,but..."Babette's gaze met Brandon's before she allowed her words to trail into meaningful silence,the unspoken implications hanging heavy between them.



Vivian's reckless theatrics had created a huge mess,and now even Babette's closest friends were openly mocking her and the Watson Group.



"Nothing compares to how smoothly everything operated when Millie held the reins here," someone whispered from a nearby workstation, giving voice to Babette's private thoughts.



But Babette adamantly refused to concede this painful truth and simply waved the speaker away with an irritated gesture.



When she turned back to continue their conversation,Brandon had already vanished without a trace.



After wandering the floor aimlessly, Brandon's mood had plummeted to even greater depths of despair.



Upon returning to the sanctuary of his executive office,he gazed at the untouched meal sitting on his  polished desk, but his appetite remained completely absent. He waved the food away with a dismissive gesture. "Please remove this immediately."



Eugene's lips curved into a mysteriously satisfied grin."Certainly,Mr.Watson."



Meanwhile, across the city, a gentle knock echoed through Millie's modest rented office space.



She lifted her gaze from the scattered documents before her to find Giffard's reassuring silhouette framed in her doorway.



"Giffard." Millie acknowledged him with genuine pleasure brightening her features.



Giffard stepped across the threshold and presented her with a lunch bag that emanated tantalizing aromas.



"I reasoned that you must be completely overwhelmed with work today, so l decided to bring you something delicious since my travels brought me through your neighborhood." He opened each container with practiced care and arranged the various dishes across an empty table with meticulous attention.



The spread included several perfectly prepared entrees accompanied by a steaming bowl of aromatic soup,all maintaining their ideal serving temperature.
"This looks absolutely divine!" Millie exclaimed,her stomach responding immediately to the enticing aromas.



"Please, enjoy every bite," Giffard encouraged with paternal fondness.



"You're incredibly thoughtful-thank you so much."Millie beamed at him, her memory stirring with thoughts of the Hussain family's recently hired chef,whose culinary skills seemed legendary among their social circle.



"My pleasure entirely." Giffard nodded graciously,his expression brightening as Millie gestured for him to join her feast. "I've already satisfied my hunger. Please,proceed without any concern for me."



Millie lifted the soup to her lips and savored the first warming sip of the soup with closed eyes.



"This captures exactly the flavors I crave most!" she declared with heartfelt enthusiasm,fixing Giffard with an intense gaze. "Should your talented chef ever consider new employment opportunities, you absolutely must provide me with the first introduction."



Giffard's eyes reflected her infectious joy as his smile broadened with genuine warmth. "I give you my solemn promise."
While observing Millie savor her meal with obvious delight, Giffard shifted to more serious matters. "In approximately six weeks, an important academic conference will convene in Flaville, and my attendance has been confirmed."



Millie paused mid-bite, her attention focusing entirely on Giffard while waiting for him to elaborate on this intriguing development.



"I've enlisted several trusted colleagues in Flaville to investigate Vivian's medical history more thoroughly Unfortunately, the medical institution maintains extremely strict confidentiality protocols and refuses to divulge patient information under normal circumstances-which,I suppose you've already learnt from Charles since he's been helping you look into this." Giffard's tone grew more determined. "When I travel there for the conference however, I plan to visit that facility personally and conduct some subtle investigations. Hope I can uncover information that might prove useful to your cause."



Millie regarded Giffard with profound gratitude shining in her eyes.



She had shared her childhood years with Alexia, and throughout those formative years, Giffard had protected her with the devotion of a caring older brother.
Her heart had always recognized him in that cherished familial role, filling a void she had carried since childhood.



"Thank you from the depths of my heart, Giffard."Millie spoke with absolute sincerity.


"Gratitude remains unnecessary between us," Giffard responded, his hand settling gently on her head with brotherly affection.
###Chapter 174 You've Had Everything Too Easily
Millie didn't dwell on much-she focused on her food,occasionally chatting with Giffard about memories from their childhood or Ari's upcoming surgery.



Meanwhile, Brandon sat in his office with his eyes closed, trying to ignore the dull ache in his stomach.



Not far from him, Eugene finished his second meal and let out a loud, satisfied burp.







The day passed quickly.



By the time the markets closed, Watson Group hadn't been hit with any major drama. That alone made the day feel calm.



Even though their stock was still dipping, most people felt things would bounce back in no time.



Everyone agreed on one thing-Watson Group had strong,reliable tech. That was their real backbone.



As long as there weren't any new disasters, the market would regain confidence.
Plus, a new product line was on the way. Watson Group never released anything unimpressive, and the anticipation alone would be enough to nudge the stock upwards again.



Later on, Eugene helped Vivian double-check that she hadn't bought any Watson Group shares, which gave Brandon a small moment of peace.



Still, even after the official announcement denying that Vivian's livestream was tied to the company,no one really bought it. Too many rumors had linked her to Brandon.



As a result, the company's public image had taken a serious hit.



People in the industry whispered and mocked behind closed doors.



Those jabs weren't online or broadcasted-they were private, quiet, and brutal. Enough to leave a permanent dent in Brandon's pride.



And Millie-her face kept flashing through his mind.His head felt like it might explode.



That was before Derek and Norma barged in. Derek didn't even bother with words at first-he raised his cane and landed a few sharp whacks on Brandon.
"Look at the nonsense that Vivian's stirred up!" Derek shouted. "Millie was with this company for seven years.Seven! And she never caused a scene-she cleaned up after others! But this Vivian-she's not even part of the company and has already dragged its name through the dirt. My friends are calling to ask if I've lost my mind.Some even told me to get checked for brain damage. You've shamed the Watson name,Brandon! Open your eyes and see that girl for who she is!" Derek unleashed his anger without restraint,scolding Brandon right there in front of everyone like it was nothing.



He swung his cane over and over like Brandon's image meaning nothing to him.



And it wasn't just Derek. The major shareholders were clearly fed up, and the foreign partners didn't bother hiding their disdain either-Egbert, especially, was ruthless in his criticism. "I came yesterday to scare you a little," he said, "but Brandon, your handling of all this is embarrassing. Thank God Millie left when she did-at least she doesn't have to share this disgrace.Oh,right. Maybe it's because she left that we're seeing the real you now. It all makes sense-Millie must've been the one covering for you. She's the reason you've made it this far. Now that she's out of the picture,you've crumbled like paper."



Even Darden chimed in, sending Brandon a sarcastic meme.He didn't say much, but the message was clear.



It was blow after blow. Brandon hadn't been hit this hard even when Millie slapped him in public or when Egbert's unexpected visit caught him off guard


This was worse. It burned deeper.


So, that day,he left the office early.


And when they drove past the mall, he suddenly asked the driver to pull over.


He remembered the puppy plushie Ari really adored and always carried with her.



With that in mind, Brandon stepped out of the car and walked into the mall.



He wondered if she liked anything else from that cartoon series-maybe something with sparkles. Little girls always liked sparkling things, didn't they?


As he browsed through rows of plush toys, one caught his eye. It was a huge, soft-looking puppy plushie-way bigger than the one Ari had.


Just as he reached for it, another hand got there first.



Brandon looked up. Myron. He was smiling as he picked up the plush toy like he'd just won a prize.
When he noticed Brandon, Myron gave a nod."Brandon, you're here too."



Brandon gave a nod back. He remembered what Darden had mentioned recently-some gossip about Myron dating a mystery woman.



It had made headlines the same day Brandon's name hit the top of the scumbag list.


Myron didn't say much. He just glanced around and spotted something behind Brandon. "Excuse me,could you move?" he asked.



Brandon stepped aside without saying a word and watched him pick up a hat with cute puppy ears.



"| heard you're chasing a woman," Brandon said,without really thinking


Myron adjusted the things in his hands and smiled."Yeah. She has a daughter who loves these. Cute little girl."



Brandon stared at him.it worth it?"



Myron didn't go looking for anything else. He just smiled.



They both knew what Brandon meant.



With Myron's status, he could easily choose someone younger, someone from a respected family. Not a woman with a child. Not someone carrying another man's name in her past.



"I really like her," Myron said after a few seconds. "I want her so badly, it messes with my sleep at night.She used to be married, and her heart was full of another man. But that's okay. I waited. I've been waiting for a long time, like a shadow just out of sight,watching quietly. Now, I finally have my chance. Her ex didn't treasure her, and really, I should thank him.He gave me this chance. She's divorced now, so I can finally chase her as openly as I want."



Brandon frowned slightly. Myron still had that calm,gentlemanly smile on his face.



"I don't get it," Brandon said.



"I know," Myron replied. His voice stayed even, but there was something intense in his eyes.



"Because you've never known what it means to ache for someone you can't have, never carried the sharp weight of wanting, never been swallowed by that slow,burning madness called jealousy. Everything came easy to you. So of course, you wouldn't understand."



Myron raised the items slightly. "I've thought everything through, step by step. And finally, she's warming up to me. She hasn't accepted me or my
feelings yet, but her daughter likes me. She even likes my cat. That's a good start and enough to keep me going."



Brandon's eyes dropped to the plushie in Myron's hand.


He had come here to buy that exact toy-for Ari.


The little girl Myron mentioned also liked that same cartoon character?



Brandon shot Myron a curious look, but Myron was already looking down, tapping at his phone.



Then he held the screen up for Brandon to see.



On it was the latest trending entertainment headline -#MillieVivianBetAgreement



The leaked document showed the agreement Derek had handed them.



Millie's section had been blurred. But Vivian's part was clear-it said if she outperformed Millie, she'd officially become Brandon's wife.



The Internet was already in chaos.

###Chapter 175 His Intuition Told Him That She Did It
The Internet was in a frenzy.



Just yesterday, Brandon had stepped forward and publicly addressed the situation between him and Vivian at a press conference-something people had been waiting for with bated breath.



But before the dust could settle, Vivian had gone live again early this morning.



And now, as if perfectly timed for maximum drama,the details of a shocking bet agreement had surfaced online.



"I've been glued to this drama for two days straight.What's actually going on between Vivian and Brandon?"



"Wait,what about Millie? Isn't she involved somehow?What does the bet say about her?"



"This is wild! I live for this kind of drama. Millie and Vivian going head-to-head? I need popcorn."



Online forums and comment sections lit up with speculation, theories, and debates.
Vivian didn't wait long to jump back into the spotlight.She appeared on a livestream, looking fragile and emotionally worn out. "The bet is real," she admitted,her voice soft and unsteady. "The timeline is exactly what's written in the agreement-three months. Derek said that if I win... he'll plan a wedding for Brandon and me."



A wistful smile flickered on her lips, one filled with longing and quiet sadness.



"I know people will judge me for this," she said,her voice cracking. "But I've always wanted a wedding.A real one. I know it might sound selfish to some, but to me, it's something I've wished for with all my heart."



She lowered her head, her shoulders sagging under the weight of emotions she could barely hold back.



"| don't know how much time I have left," Vivian whispered. "I might not even make it to the wedding day. And as for Millie... I don't even know if she'd agree to any of this." She paused, catching herself."Ah, maybe I shouldn't have said that. I'm not feeling well today, so I'll stop here." Trying to gather herself,she forced a small smile. "By the way, my miniseries Love of Vivian is currently in its final stage before hitting theaters. It may take some time, but I hope you'll stay tune to it."



With that, the screen faded to black. Her pale face and glassy eyes lingered in the minds of thousands.



At the store, Myron quietly put his phone away after watching Vivian's live broadcast.



·Brandon stood nearby,jaw clenched and eyes stormy Without a word, he turned on his heel and walked out of the store.



Myron watched him go, and then looked at the plush toy in his hand, a knowing smile tugging at the edge of his lips.



Meanwhile, Vivian was already moving forward with her plan. She had instructed Johnny to begin the PR campaign.



And it was working. The Internet had quickly taken her side.



"One wedding-that's all she wants," read a comment."If Vivian's truly dying, and Millie and Brandon are no longer together, then what's the harm in letting her have this moment? All Millie has to do... is step aside and let herself lose."



"Come on, Millie, just let her have this. It's not like you and Brandon are still together. Isn't a dying woman's last wish more important than your pride?"



"Didn't Vivian mention her miniseries 'Love of Vivian'is heading totheaters soon? Let's all buy tickets to support her. Isn't the outcome of the bet tied to the film's success anyway?"



"Exactly! Everyone, go get your tickets. Let's show up for Love of Vivian!"



And just like that, a tide began to swell online-loud,emotional,and impossible to ignore.



Other opinions, no matter how rational or skeptical,were quickly drowned in this rising storm of sympathy



Anyone who dared question the narrative or criticize Vivian was immediately attacked, labeled cruel or disrespectful toward someone battling a terminal illness.



And so, Love of Vivian became more than a movie.It turned into a symbol. Supporting it became the righteous thing to do.







Meanwhile, Millie arrived at the headquarters of Evans Entertainment.



She was accompanied by Seville and Charles.



The three stood in quiet frustration, glancing at each other.



"So... what now? Do we fight back, or do we still  pretend she's untouchable?" Seville asked dryly,folding his arms.



He had just uncovered the truth-the song Glimmer of Love was actually written by Millie.



In the beginning, Vivian had only obtained certain legal rights related to the track. These included the transferable property and neighboring rights under copyright law.



But the moral rights, like the right to be acknowledged as the original creator,still legally belonged to Millie.



Yet Vivian had claimed credit for everything-the lyrics, the composition, even the performance.Without hesitation or humility, she had promoted the song as her personal masterpiece.



Evans Entertainment had already issued a legal warning, urging her to stop her infringement. But Vivian hadn't backed down.



In fact, she pushed further. Now, she was even planning to make a film inspired by the song.



"It's obvious Vivian wants to use Love of Vivian as her winning card," Charles commented with a serious expression. "But is she really going to ignore the importance of something as fundamental as the right of attribution?"
Millie sat still, her fingers lightly tapping the edge of the wooden table beside her.



"I'm not sure what Vivian's really thinking," she said finally, her voice calm but thoughtful. "But Brandon...he'll take care of it." She turned to Charles, eyes sharp with purpose. "You saidBrandon tried to offer us hush money?"



Charles gave a small nod. "He did. But I turned him down."



Millie fell silent for a moment, recalling the way Brandon usually handled things. Then, with quiet certainty, she rose to her feet. "It'll probably happen within the next few days. If he really plans to help Vivian win this bet, he'll come back to you. And when he does, don't shut him down completely. Just tell him you need time to think it over."



"What if they choose to back out?" Charles asked,confusion etched on his face. With the stakes so higgh,it made sense-they'd likely shelve the project and begin anew.



Brandon should know that better than anyone.



And with the influence and resources he possessed,launching a fresh project for Vivian wouldn't be difficult.
Walking away from this one seemed like the most logical choice



But Millie's eyes met Charles' with quiet certainty, her expression unreadable, her tone unwavering.



"He won't back out," she said softly. "He'll go through with it."








Meanwhile,across town, Brandon had already picked Vivian up.



The two of them were now en route to a restaurant.



Neither of them spoke as the car glided through the city streets. Silence stretched between them,heavy and lingering.



Vivian appeared even more fragile than she had that morning. She leaned against the seat,her complexion pale,her shoulders slumped.



Outside, the cityscape blurred past the windows in a rush of color and motion.



After a long pause, Brandon finally broke the silence.His voice was low but pointed. "Did you leak the details about the bet agreement?"



Vivian turned to him, her expression painted with disbelief and hurt. Her eyes reddened, her lips parted slightly, as if the question alone had wounded her.



"Brandon... do you really think I'd do something like that?" she whispered, her voice thin and trembling."After what Eugene pulled today, I've been on edge all afternoon. I barely held myself together and just went home to rest."



Brandon shot him a glance.



He knew the truth-only a handful of people had been present in the office that day when the bet agreement was first discussed. Only they had access to the original document. Now that it had somehow made its way online, the list of possible culprits was painfully short.



"Brandon,I know exactly what you're thinking," Vivian said. "But there are so many ways that agreement could've gotten out. Maybe your grandparents had a hand in it. Or maybe Millie showed it to her lawyer, and they took a picture without permission. It could've even been left out somewhere-on a desk, in a meeting room-and someone just happened to see it."She paused, her eyes growing redder, as if on the verge of tears. "But out of everyone, you only suspect me."



There was a hurt in her voice that pressed against the silence in the car,heavy and sharp.
"Just like earlier," she continued, blinking rapidly,"when I told you l didn't buy those stocks, and you still didn't believe me."



Brandon rubbed his temple. A dull ache had begun to build behind his eyes.



He knew she wasn't entirely wrong-her explanations were plausible. But his instincts screamed otherwise.



Still, he pushed the thought aside.



Dwelling on it wouldn't help.



Right now, the only thing that mattered was keeping Millie around. And for that, Vivian had to win.



After a brief pause, he spoke in a low, measured voice,"Forget about that film. We're not moving forward with it."



Vivian's head snapped toward him. "What?" she exclaimed, her voice rising in alarm. "Why? Brandon,are you helping her now?"



But Brandon didn't react. He simply met her gaze with a quiet calmness that made her shift uneasily in her seat.



"There's a problem with the right of attribution," he said,each word deliberate and measured. "Before all this, maybe we could've handled it quietly, settled it with some negotiation." But not now.



He thought back to the way Charles had looked at Millie,still posing as Serena.


That quiet admiration in his eyes hadn't gone unnoticed.



It was the look that had sparked Brandon's own suspicions about Serena's identity, suspicions he had repeatedly pushed away.



Vivian's jaw clenched, her hands curling in her lap.


"Love of Vivian" wasn't just a random project. It was everything. She couldn't afford to stop now.



No one knew she was faking her illness-not Derek,not Norma, and certainly not Brandon. And with Brandon's trust already fading, even a single misstep could destroy everything.



To secure her place in the Watson family, she had to completely outshine Millie-show she was more worthy, more capable in every way. And when she eventually "recovered from cancer," it would be seen as a miraculous comeback.



Millie, in her eyes, had nothing substantial. She had spent years relying on the Watson Group, quietly handling Brandon's daily affairs without building a name of her own.



The only thing Millie truly had was her musical talent -the same gift that had made her shine under the alias Serena.



So, Vivian was determined to use Love of Vivian to destroy her. In both music and drama, she would leave Millie in the dust.
###Chapter 176 She Began To Look Forward To It
Back in those days, Vivian had proclaimed with unwavering determination that "Glimmer of Love"represented her deepest reflections on existence and mortality, her heartfelt tribute to Brandon.



The song even faced off against "Yesterday,"performed by both Serena and Millie, creating a golden marketing battleground.



When the moment arrived, Vivian could manipulate public sentiment by crushing Millie through her own promotional campaigns, transforming her personal tragedy into commercial gold.



Beyond the marketing advantage, audiences believed she had crafted this masterpiece independently,earning their respect far more easily than her previous collaborations that seemed to lean heavily on Brandon's influence. She intended to cultivate her image as a self-reliant artist, seizing this golden opportunity to systematically destroy Millie's reputation.



She needed to win, and no other composition or venture could deliver such devastating results.
She refused to allow this golden opportunity to escape her grasp!



"Brandon, I understand that Charles will stand behind Millie," Vivian declared,her voice carrying calculated certainty. "But Eva holds the ultimate power in this decision. We simply need to secure Eva's allegiance."



And Eva...



Vivian's lips curved into a contemptuous smile as she dismissed the woman as nothing more than a pretentious fraud.



Eva had initially rejected their offer to purchase the song, yet when the monetary offer reached her satisfaction threshold, she surrendered it willingly.



This mercenary behavior had eliminated Vivian's fears from the very beginning.



Consider this scenario: Evans Entertainment maintained that Eva had composed the song, but Eva herself contradicted this claim, insisting that Vivian had written it, declaring that Charles had woven lies to benefit Millie.



Which version would the public embrace?



While celebrities maintained contractual obligations with their agencies, many decisions remained within  their personal control, which gave them the opportunity to turn Eva against her company.



Such conflicts between celebrities and their agencies could spiral into complex legal nightmares, potentially stretching across countless years of bitter litigation.



Furthermore, Eva's insatiable greed for money meant that with sufficient financial incentive, she would dance to whatever tune they played.



Even if, years down the road, Evans Entertainment somehow managed to pursue legal action against Vivian,she would have already secured her position as Brandon's wife by then.



Naturally, she kept these calculating thoughts buried deep within her mind. Instead, she gazed at him with tears glistening in her eyes. "Brandon, I acknowledge my mistake regarding the song's ownership. My emotions clouded my judgment completely back then.Please grant me one more opportunity, won't you?Let's approach Eva together and make proper amends.If we can negotiate a fair settlement with her, then no injustice will remain. Should this attempt fail, we'll abandon our plans entirely and try someone new as you suggested."



Brandon studied Vivian's face with growing unease.



When had she transformed into someone so utterly devoid of moral boundaries?



Vivian shrank back under the weight of his penetrating stare.



Eventually, Brandon simply averted his piercing gaze,his expression hardening with resolve.



A conversation with Eva had become unavoidable.



Charles was championing Millie's cause, which meant that at the crucial moment, the question of the song's true authorship would inevitably surface, and Brandon understood he needed to seal this dangerous crack before it widened.



Millie's sharp, accusatory gaze haunted his memories,refusing to fade.



Victory was his only acceptable outcome.







Charles questioned the foundation of Millie's unwavering confidence in her predictions.



After all, they were all carefully groomed heirs of distinguished family dynasties who had been meticulously shaped and molded since their earliest childhood years to inherit vast empires.



When someone truly lacked the necessary skills,they were typically assigned to domestic responsibilities,such as bearing heirs, much like his own father, who devoted his existence to pursuing beautiful women and continuously expanding his lineage through countless romantic conquests.



Competent successors instinctively grasped the critical importance of managing potential disasters before they struck.



And Brandon's track record spoke volumes about his abilities.



Even though they all considered Brandon utterly reprehensible in matters of romantic relationships,he had successfully guided Watson Group to achieve dominance over Crobert's three most powerful corporate entities. Aside from this recent misjudgment involving Vivian, his leadership had proven consistently exemplary.



Therefore, he shouldn't possess such profound blindness as to venture this far into treacherous territory.



However, before Charles could delve deeper into his mounting suspicions, his phone erupted with an urgent call from the company headquarters, informing him that representatives from Watson Group demanded a meeting the following day and insisted that Eva's presence was absolutely non-negotiable.
Charles felt his composure shatter beneath the weight of this unexpected development.


He immediately contacted Millie to share this startling information.



Millie was with Ari during that precise moment.



After absorbing the news, she offered only a brief acknowledgment of understanding.



"I must confess, you truly comprehend his psychological patterns with remarkable precision,"Charles muttered through the phone's speaker, his voice tinged with reluctant admiration.



Millie kept staring at her phone's screen even after she hung up, as the motionless interface reflected her contemplative expression.


She genuinely understood Brandon's methods with frightening accuracy.



Seven grueling years saturated with countless moments of life-and-death interdependence had forged an unbreakable understanding between them -how could such intimate knowledge simply evaporate into nothingness?



Yet, the reality of the situation might not align perfectly with Charles' confident assumptions and carefully constructed theories.


It wasn't that Brandon remained ignorant of fundamental risk control principles; instead, he was desperately searching for ways to repair the devastating damage after the fact.


Unfortunately, Vivian's blinding influence had completely clouded his judgment.



What he perceived as a thoughtful remedy and strategic solution, Vivian interpreted through an entirely different lens that served her own twisted agenda.



Clasping Ari's small hand firmly in hers, Millie emerged from the school grounds.


They exchanged delightful stories about Ari's entertaining adventures at kindergarten throughout the day. As they approached the familiar street corner,a recognizable vehicle caught their attention.



Myron positioned himself beside the sleek vehicle,his warm smile radiating genuine pleasure as he welcomed them both, carefully cradling a specialized pet carrier that housed his beloved plush feline companion, which responded to their approach with an endearing "meow" that seemed perfectly timed.



Ari's eyes immediately transformed into brilliant pools of wonder and delight.
Millie discovered Ari's enthusiastic reaction utterly charming and endearing.



During previous encounters, Myron had attempted to capture Millie's affections through this same charming feline strategy; while she had remained completely unmoved, Ari had fallen completely under the cat's irresistible spell.



They approached the car with eager steps and settled comfortably into the luxurious interior.



Once they were safely inside, Myron carefully released the cat from its temporary confinement, and the intelligent creature, fully aware of its enchanting purpose, rolled onto its back in invitation for gentle strokes.



Positioned on the vehicle's rear bench sat an enormous, impossibly soft plush toy that doubled as the most luxurious cushion imaginable.



Ari cast a questioning glance toward Millie, who responded with an encouraging nod of approval,prompting Ari to naturally gravitate toward the cat and embrace it with tender affection.



Millie found herself genuinely amazed by the seamless interaction unfolding before her eyes



"We've encountered this little one a handful of times
 already. Yet we never got to ask about its name,"Millie said to Myron with genuine amusement dancing in her voice.



"Its name is Kiki, though Jayceon had originally lobbied for the name Fatty, but | believed Kiki possessed far more elegant appeal," Myron explained with obvious fondness.



Millie's smile blossomed as she nodded her wholehearted agreement with his choice.



The small group ventured out together to share an evening meal.


Millie couldn't suppress her growing amusement at their evolving pattern; they had originally agreed to meet just once each week, yet now their encounters seemed to occur with daily frequency.


"This is just a casual night out with Ari; but I have developed elaborate plans for our weekly rendezvous,"Myron declared, directing his knowing smile directly at her. "That'll be our date night, and I intend to surprise you beyond your expectations."



Millie studied his expression with growing curiosity before offering a thoughtful nod of acknowledgment.



She found herself genuinely beginning to look forward to whatever he had planned.
...



While the harmonious trio savored their pleasant evening together, Brandon and Vivian's dinner unfolded under a suffocating cloud of unmistakable tension.



Shortly afterward, Brandon escorted Vivian back to her residence before proceeding to Blue Lounge,honoring Darden's invitation that he had accepted earlier in the day.


Tonight, Darden had deliberately/ chosen not to invite any additional company; the evening belonged exclusively to the two of them and their shared solitude over drinks.



The dance floor below them pulsed with vibrant energy, filled with countless people moving rhythmically to the hypnotic, pounding music.



Yet the two men consumed their alcohol in heavy,oppressive silence.



Both men carried the heavy burden of their respective troubles, weighing down their spirits like anchors.



After draining their glasses completely,they departed without ceremony.



This marked their first encounter with absolutely zero  dialogue exchanged between them, nothing but methodical drinking to fill the hollow space.



During the journey back to his residence, the driver navigated the streets while Brandon slouched in the rear seat, his entire body radiating profound discomfort.



He had never before experienced such overwhelming despair and emptiness.



He questioned whether perhaps he hadn't consumed sufficient alcohol to numb his pain.



Consequently, he instructed the driver to halt the vehicle and ventured into a nearby convenience store to purchase additional bottles of liquor.



From within the brightly lit store emerged the harsh sounds of a couple engaged in a heated, acrimonious argument.



"Don't assume I'm some pathetic coward like that spineless Millie! If you have the audacity to flirt with others again, I'll slice it clean off! Let's see exactly how you manage to charm anyone without your precious 'equipment'!" a woman's voice shrieked with unmistakable venom.



"How can you behave in such a manner, completely abandoning any trace of feminine gentleness," the man shot back with defensive indignation.
"Go straight to hell! Screw your ridiculous gentleness!Let me make this crystal clear-I am naturally fierce and uncompromising in this exact manner; sotell me what you're going to do about that?"



The heated argument continued its destructive course while Brandon slowly lowered his gaze, focusing intently on the bottles of alcohol cradled within his trembling hands.



Eventually, he silently gathered his purchases and approached the self-checkout machine to complete his transaction in solitude.



Outside the store's entrance, a gleaming Bentley glided past,carrying the joyfully laughing Millie,Myron,and Ari within its luxurious interior, their happiness completely unnoticed by the brooding Brandon.
###Chapter 177 Mr. Watson,What's Your Take On This
The following morning, MMillie stepped into the marble lobby of Evans Entertainment, arriving a few minutes ahead of schedule. She'd deliberately timed it so she'd have a chance to meet with Charles before Brandon showed up-she wanted to nail down the Elliott Group endorsement details without distractions.



She kicked things off by filling Charles in on the latest developments.



The samples she inspected alongside Myron and Adriana remained prototypes, unshaped stones poised for transformation into finished gems.



"The Elliott Group's new products are positioned for the mid-to-high-end market just as they promised in our last contract," he noted, his gaze steady.



Millie nodded in agreement. "Exactly. Plus,the Elliott Group's given me a ton of creative freedom for the endorsement, so I've got an idea that I want to run by you."



Charles gestured for her to continue, a hint of a smile playing at his lips. "Let's hear it."
Millie brightened, her eyes lighting up with enthusiasm."Let's try something strategic-we can link each new song to a particular Elliott Group gemstone, but not in a way that forces people to buy both. Think of it as a pairing: every gem has its own song. The cross-promotion would be massive."



Charles considered the idea, tapping his pen thoughtfully. "It's clever. But what if people push back?Vivian will jump at any excuse to cause chaos."



"That's why we have to keep a sharp line between the endorsement and the songs." Millie's lips curved in a confident, reassuring smile. "I'll handle the endorsement-Millie as brand ambassador. But the music? That's Eva's domain."



"I'm listening." Charles leaned in, curiosity sharpening his gaze. Millie's contact was managed by Evans Entertainment, and any lucrative payoff would benefit them both. But even if the company made little-or took a loss-Charles had already decided: he'd back Millie all the way.



Just as Millie prepared to elaborate, a brisk knock sounded at the door.



"Mr. Evans, the Watson Group representatives are here," the assistant declared from the hallway.



Charles didn't hesitate. "Take them to the first meeting room," he instructed, already shifting gears.



Millie caught his eye, her lips curving into a knowing half-smile. "Let's go meet them first. I'll fill you in later-though I have a feeling you've already pieced most of it together."



A jolt of anticipation ran through Charles; every time he teamed up with Millie and set to make something big, he felt a surge of adrenaline.



He'd been watching Oakley's every move, eager to seize the upper hand, but Oakley hadn't shown his hand yet. For now,patience was his only weapon..



"Sure, let's do this!" Charles replied, his voice upbeat.He passed Millie the last few items she'd requested for her disguise,his excitement barely contained.







The meeting room felt like a walk-in freezer, the air conditioning blasting as Millie and Charles strode in together, their bulky frog costumes swallowing every hint of their real selves.



Brandon and Vivian exchanged bewildered glances,clearly thrown off by the spectacle.



Vivian squinted, her confusion evident. "Can someone please explain what's happening?"
Charles tugged off his oversized frog head, tousling his damp hair as he spoke. "We've got a big company event today. You caught us just as we finished, so we came straight over."



Millie wrestled with her own headpiece, fumbling with the clasp, but it refused to budge.



Charles shot her a sympathetic look. "Seems like that one's wedged on tight. Don't force it and risk hurting yourself-we'll get someone to help you in a minute.Just leave it for now."



The so-called event was real enough, but it was carefully staged for one purpose-keeping Millie's identity under wraps.



Since Brandon and Vivian indeed showed up earlier than expected, the whole setup felt even more convincing.



Millie caught Charles' eye and gave a subtle nod.



Charles faced their guests with practiced calm. "So,what brings you both here today? Anything you'd like to get off your chest?"



Vivian's gaze lingered on the frog-suited Millie before she answered. "Actually, we wanted to talk about 'Glimmer of Love.'"
Charles motioned for the assistant and the rest of the staff to step out, shutting the door behind them.



He shot Millie a meaningful look, and then turned to Vivian. "Vivian, our company's already served you with a legal notice. We've warned you multiple times about your infringement, and you chose to ignore it.Frankly, there's nothing left to negotiate."



He delivered the line with the precise cadence he and Millie had rehearsed earlier.



Vivian brushed Charles aside, focusing instead on the silent woman in the oversized frog costume.



"Eva, what about you?" she asked, her eyes narrowing with a sly glint before shifting to a look of fake concern.



She let out a soft sigh, voice dripping with affected sympathy. "It can't be easy, can it? Being a nobody at Evans Entertainment, selling your songs quietly while the company keeps all the spotlight for someone else."



The instant Vivian finished, Charles and Brandon both turned to her, their reactions sharply opposed.



Brandon's brow knit in silent displeasure, but Charles shot to his feet, his voice sharp with outrage. "Vivian,what the hell are you saying?"

Vivian offered only a tight, rueful smile, guilt flickering across her face. "I claimed your song as my own. That was wrong of me, and I'm here to make it right."


She rose and gave a formal, apologetic bow. "Today,I want to settle this once and for all. Brandon and I are prepared to pay you for the right of attribution, so the song will belong solely to me."


Vivian turned to the Millie still hidden in the frog costume, her expression softening with feigned concern. "You probably could use the money," she murmured, her smile carrying a note of pity. "Wearing a mascot suit in this heat just to get by-it can't be easy."



Charles bristled, barely containing his rage.



Ignoring him completely, Vivian clasped her hands and leaned in, her tone turning gentle, as if offering a lifeline. "So, why not accept my offer?"



Millie kept silent, her face unreadable behind the mascot head. Charles, not missing a beat, raised his voice, flinging accusations at Vivian. "Vivian, you're unbelievable! Eva, don't listen to her-those song rights belong to you, and no one can take that away."



Peering through the mesh of the costume, Millie watched Vivian's smug little smirk and Brandon's poker-faced calm.

She coughed twice, adding a scratchy rasp to her voice.



"Mr. Watson, what's your take on this?" she asked,deliberately sounding hoarse.



At last, Brandon's gaze settled on the mascot. He studied the frog costume, trying to size her up.



The disguise was nearly perfect; not a single feature gave her away.



Brandon's mind flickered back to the last time he'd run into this woman-her identity just as hidden then..



Even in that memory, she'd shielded herself with massive sunglasses and a mask.



The remnant of her unfamiliar perfume clung to the present moment, threading through the air between them.



A faint line appeared between Brandon's brows.



After a beat, he spoke, his tone measured. "Legally,the right of attribution belongs to you, and what's happened is clear-cut infringement. We can end the violation here-but Eva, you have to keep this quiet."



Vivian's feigned pleasantness fell away, her lips pressing into a thin line as she shot Brandon an aggrieved glare.



This wasn't the plan she'd orchestrated.



Millie's response was a low, amused laugh. "Is that all?"



Brandon's expression darkened with skepticism as he studied her. "Then what do you propose?"


Millie lowered her gaze, her voice rough with pretense."My take's a little different. Just like Miss Simpson mentioned, I need money." She smiled faintly, her tone gentle. "But I'm not talking about cash."



If not cash,then resources?



Brandon caught on right away,giving a composed nod."That's doable."



Vivian, on the other hand, didn't hide her dissatisfaction. She shot Brandon a pointed look."Brandon."



But he paid her no mind, eyes fixed steadily on Millie.



Vivian's irritation simmered, though she managed to keep it from her face.



She turned back to Millie, refusing to back down. "Eva,as long as you keep quiet about this, you'll get compensated. So why not take more? The result's the same for you either way. Hand over the right of attribution, work with me, and I'll make sure you're well compensated."
###Chapter 178 Her First Date With Myron

Millie looked at Vivian and smiled. "Why do you think I will choose not to reveal the truth?"



Vivian froze, as if hit by something she didn't see coming."What?"



Brandon stood beside them, frowning at Millie. Was this all a trick?



She had just mentioned needing money. That made it seem like she was ready to give in.



But Millie stayed calm, her expression steady.



"Some things can't be patched up with a simple sorry."Her voice came out raspy.


No matter the reason, hurt was still hurt.



"I won't sell my right of attribution. If you came here hoping I'd change my mind, then you'll be disappointed," she said.



Vivian opened her mouth, but Millie gave a quiet laugh."You were the ones who pushed me into selling the song."

She paused and turned slightly, eyes meeting Vivian's."But I didn't force you to infringe."


With that, Millie stood and prepared to leave. Charles stood beside her, a smug look on his face.


"Eva," Brandon called from behind.



Millie didn't stop or turn.



"I hope you'll reconsider. You've got talent. If we can settle this, Watson Group is willing to invest in your future," his voice followed her.



But the girl in the frog mascot costume walked straight out of the meeting room.



Vivian watched her go, fury twisting her face.


Eva was clearly using their conflict to strike a better deal.


And Brandon...


Vivian glanced at him.



What was going through his mind?



"Let's head back," Brandon said.



Vivian quickly adjusted her expression, trying to look upset instead of angry.
"Hold off on the film for now. I'll get you into other projects," Brandon added, still staring after the frog.What exactly was Eva trying to pull?



Vivian didn't respond.



Maybe to Brandon, any project would do. But not for her. "Love of Vivian" was special.



It had to succeed. It had to shine. Only then could she fully outshine Millie and win the Watson family's approval.



She needed a plan.



Elsewhere, Millie turned to Charles. "To defeat someone, first drive them crazy."



People only valued things they earned with effort.



When something came too easy, it always raised suspicion.



Millie took off the frog costume and looked up at the sky.



Charles followed her gaze as he removed his own costume, admiring her profile. "What are you looking at?"



"The weather's nice today," she said. Perfect for her first date with Myron.



Charles looked at the sky and nodded. "Yeah. It is."







Later that day, Millie changed into a soft blue dress.


At dusk, Myron's car pulled up outside her apartment building.



In his anxious yet eager eyes, she climbed in,and they drove to the harbor.


"I was a little worried earlier. I thought you might back out," Myron said after they arrived.



"Why would I?" Millie smiled at him.


She had been looking forward to it.


They got out and walked to the restaurant.



The evening was beautiful. The sea stretched wide and blue,meeting the warm orange sky.



Their table was in a quiet corner of the restaurant.



Myron had planned this evening long ago.



As they walked and talked, neither noticed the reporters hiding nearby, snapping away in secret.
"I heard Myron booked a restaurant to charm some mystery woman. Jackpot! Keep clicking!"



"Yeah, later we'll sneak in dressed as staff and get a clear shot of her face!"
Millie and Myron eventually arrived at a quiet, secluded part of the restaurant.



The place actually had two parts-above and below sea level.



He led her down to the underwater section.



Through clear glass walls, they could see fish gliding by in a calm, dreamy world.



As they sat, Millie spotted a few fish hovering near the glass.



While Myron chatted briefly with the chef, Millie touched the glass out of curiosity.



The fish twitched and then quickly darted away



Myron noticed.



He gestured for the chef and the wait staff to leave and turned to her.
"Give me your hand," he said.



Millie thought for a second, and then offered the hand that had touched the glass.



"Now your index finger," he said.



She extended it.



He took her hand and gently pressed her fingertip against the glass.



"Now watch," he said.



To her surprise, the fish swam toward her fingertip.More followed, swirling together, forming a beautiful scene in the quiet water.



The motion stirred the water, and the soft lights made it feel like magic-like she was underwater herself.



"Do you like it?" he asked.



The glass was cool under her finger, but his palm was warm.



Millie turned and saw his gentle smile. She nodded with a smile of her own.



"How did you do that?" she asked.



He let go of her hand, signaling her to check her  finger.



It sparkled slightly.



"The fish are drawn to this glittering powder," he explained.



So that was it.



Millie looked at her fingertip, and then touched the glass again. The fish came right back.



"It's amazing," she whispered


"Years ago, I ran into all kinds of strange creatures at sea. If you're curious, I can tell you more," he said.


"I'd love that," Millie said with a nod.



She traveled a lot for work, but most of it was by air.The sea was still a mystery to her.



He began telling stories-about rare creatures,minerals, and distant places she'd never been.



She listened, more relaxed than she had felt in a long time.



There were no games here. No overthinking. Just his voice and the sea.



"Once, in Eldoria, I saw something the locals called 'Blue Rain.' It fellall night-glowing,gentle,beautiful,"
he said.



"What was that like? Did you take pictures?" she asked,caught in the wonder of it.



"I'll show you," he said, reaching out his hand.



She looked at it, hesitated for a beat, and then placed her hand in his.



He smiled and held it tightly, guiding her back above sea level.



By now, night had fallen.


As they climbed the steps, Millie saw it.


Near the shore, beneath the soft glow of lights, a small patch of Blue Rain was falling.


Not like the sky's blue-this was glowing, magical, like something from a dream.



She reached out, catching a few drops in her palm.



It felt unreal, like a scene from a fairy tale.
###Chapter 179 Dancing In The Blue Rain
Millie and Myron had no idea the Internet had erupted with the headline-"Myron Elliott unleashes blue rain to win over a mystery woman."



The attached image was nothing short of cinematic.



A pair of silhouettes stood close together beneath a curtain of luminous blue rain, the woman's elegant hand outstretched to catch the falling drops while Myron lingered at her side, his body turned protectively toward her, his lips curved into a warm,private smile meant only for the woman beside him.



Myron's broad shoulders concealed most of her face,making her identity impossible to guess, but the breeze caught the hem of her flowing blue dress and sent her hair streaming behind her, capturing a snapshot of effortless intimacy beneath the wash of cool color.



A second,even clearer photo immediately followed,this one alive with movement.



Blue rain shimmered in midair; the woman's graceful arm reached up, skin gleaming under the city lights, as Myron looked down at her with unmistakable affection.
Captivated, she took in the brilliant spectacle he'd crafted for her alone, as he watched her closely, his love shining plainly in his expression.



Online gossip swirled, everyone desperate to unmask the enigmatic woman who'd captured Myron's attention-a feat in itself, since he was notorious for being impervious to romantic intrigue.







All the while, the blue rain kept falling, drenching the world in surreal color as Millie studied the vivid droplets streaking across her palm.



Suddenly, a broad, warm hand appeared, gently pressing a soft, damp cloth against her skin.



She looked up in surprise as Myron meticulously wiped each of her fingers, erasing every last trace of blue.



When he finished, he set the cloth aside and threaded his fingers firmly through hers, his grip both reassuring and deliberate.



Millie caught sight of their entwined hands but made no move to break away.



"Come with me," he murmured.



Without hesitation, he guided her across the rain-  slicked lawn to a waiting pavilion.



Beneath the endless blue rain, he finally let go of her hand.



Music floated through the air-soft, romantic,utterly inviting.


With a flourish, Myron bowed to her, a playful spark in his eyes.



"May I have this dance?" he asked, offering his hand with a hopeful smile.



Something unnamable stirred in Millie's chest-an emotion that made her heart beat strangely fast.



"I'd like that," she replied, steadying her voice as she slipped her hand into his.



His fingers closed around hers with quiet confidence,and then settled at her waist, guiding her effortlessly across the pavilion's polished floor.



Light glimmered from above, casting a delicate glow over their entwined figures. She laid her free hand gently on his shoulder and tilted her chin, meeting his gaze.



He smiled down at her, yet his eyes seemed to hold an entire world she suddenly longed to understand.
Beyond the pavilion, blue rain poured in silver sheets,while inside, a lamp spilled warm light across the polished floor, stretching their shadows until they nearly touched the far walls.


Soft, lilting music played as they turned together,each careful step drawing them closer in the hush.



A tranquil, almost dreamlike intimacy enveloped them.



A stray breeze teased a strand of Millie's hair, and the faint trace of her perfume drifted between them,making Myron's gaze sharpen with something unspoken.



She lifted her eyes, drawn in by the darkness in his gaze.Something inside her fluttered. Millie's attention trailed along the strong lines of his face-those thoughtful eyes, the defined nose, the faint curve of his lips-until her courage faltered and she looked away,pulse quickening.



"Have we met before?" she ventured quietly,letting her hand settle with gentle familiarity on his shoulder.Her tone was searching, almost hopeful."I mean,not at work-somewhere else?"



A slow, knowing smile touched Myron's lips. "We have,"he answered, his voice rich and mellow. "But only in passing. I doubt I made much of an impression back then."
Millie dipped her head, lashes fluttering as she smiled back. "I see," she murmured, unable to hide the hint of curiosity in her eyes.



After a moment's hesitation, she queried, "Can you tell me?"



Myron let out a low laugh, warmth glinting in his eyes."If I tried to list them all, we'd be here all night. Maybe I should save the details for our next weekly check-ins."



He tilted his head, his tone teasing. "How does that sound?"



Millie gave a soft nod, catching his meaning and letting the question drop.



As the last notes of the waltz drifted through the air,their steps slowed to a gentle halt.



The two stood beneath the pavilion's shelter, face-to -face, the hush between them unexpectedly intimate.



For a few lingering heartbeats, neither spoke, the moment stretching, charged with an odd, fluttery tension.



Suddenly, Millie couldn't help it-she burst out laughing, her voice ringing in the night.
Myron laughed along, their joy spilling out until they both bent over, breathless and grinning



Eventually, Myron caught Millie just in time, steadying her before her ankle could twist in her high heels.



A playful smile lingered as he nodded toward a shaded table nearby. "Come on. Let's catch our breath over there. I've got some cocktails with barely any alcohol -thought we could just relax and watch the waves for a bit."



"Sounds perfect." Millie brushed away lingering tears of laughter, letting the last giggle fade as she joined him at the table. She lifted a glass, sipped cautiously,and let out a quiet sigh when she tasted how light it really was. Leaning back against the pavilion rail,they both let the salty air and low, murmured conversation fill the space between them.



Not far away, two undercover paparazzi-dressed as servers-could only stare,utterly floored by the scene unfolding before them.



Their hands hovered uncertainly over their cameras,eyes flickering between the relaxed couple and each other.



After a beat, one of them broke the silence. "Unless my eyes are playing tricks on me, that's Millie with Myron,isn't it?"
To seal the confirmation, he added, "Millie Bennett-the woman who finalized her divorce from Brandon only days ago!"



Another, gripping his camera with shaking hands,nodded so fast he nearly dropped it. "Swear on my life,that's her. No mistake."



A thin sheen of sweat shone on his brow as he glanced at the camera's screen, heart pounding. "And we've got the shots.Full proof. Should we-should we ask if they want to buy them off? If they do, this could be huge!"



He took a shaky step forward, intending to approach Myron,but the more composed one grabbed his arm."Don't even think about it. They're clearly on a date. If you barge in, Myron might actually kill you. Here's what we'll do: post a teaser-just a few photos where Millie's face isn't visible. Let people know we've got something big. Then reach out to Jayceon and see if he wants to negotiate. I'm sure the Elliott family already knows what's up. If Jayceon can't make the call, we'll approach Myron tomorrow. But whatever you do, do not interrupt them tonight."



The other one nodded, swallowing again as tension buzzed between them.



Minutes later, a short video surfaced online.
Under a pavilion draped in blue rain, Myron and a woman swayed together, the music casting a dreamy spell over the scene.



The camera angle kept her face hidden, but her smooth skin, elegant silhouette, and effortless dance moves left no doubt she was stunning.



Still, it was Myron's mesmerized stare that stole the spotlight-he looked at her as if he couldn't see anyone else.



The Internet erupted again.



Frustrated viewers cursed the pillar that blocked her face-"Would someone please move that column already?"-while gossip forums lit up with theories."Who is she? What kind of woman could enchant Myron like that?"



As speculation exploded online, Brandon's phone started buzzing.



He glanced down at the screen-a message from Darden.



"Myron and his mystery girlfriend are all over the news!You have to see this!"



Darden had fired off several gossip links in their chat.
Brandon's mind flashed back to his last run-in with Myron at the mall, recalling every word of that tense conversation.



He tapped the links, scrolling through the trending hashtags, vivid paparazzi shots, and a short video clip of Myron and the woman twirling through the blue rain.



A faint frown creased his brow. There was something eerily familiar about the way the woman moved,the graceful curve of her figure-almost as if he'd seen her somewhere before.
###Chapter 180 Myron Madly Pursues Millie
The rain had finally faded, leaving the sky a clean,endless dark shade. Millie sipped on her cocktail, her gaze drifting over the waves.



Myron's voice came, soft but steady-he wanted to know if she'd care if people found out about them dating.



She let out an airy laugh. "Why would I? Sooner or later, everyone's going to know."



Her eyes drifted to the sea, and with the alcohol lightening her mood, a sudden urge to step into the waves stirred inside her.



With those thoughts, she gave in to the moment and moved without hesitation.



Kicking off her heels and clutching them loosely,she wandered barefoot across the sand, drawn to the playful dance of the waves.



Myron trailed after her, hands in his pockets,a fond smile lingering on his lips.



Without warning,Millie tossed her shoes into the sand, crouched, and flung a sparkling arc of seawater right at him, laughter bubbling from her chest.



Caught off guard, he took the splash head-on,blinking in surprise for just a heartbeat before his lips curled into a warm, forgiving smile.



With a playful gleam in his eye, he knelt by the water's edge, scooped up a handful, and sent a sparkling arc right back at her.



Millie laughed, sidestepping his retaliation with practiced agility. "Nice try!" she called, darting along the shoreline, nimble as a child as she kicked up bursts of foam in her wake.



The two of them chased each other through the shallows, water droplets flying as laughter tangled with the sound of the waves. Myron's usually sleek hair was soon a dripping, tangled mess, dark strands plastered to his forehead and cheeks.



Millie flashed a mischievous grin, but then out of nowhere...



For a moment, a distant memory tugged at her-a different day, the same face, only then, his expression had been somber, his smile nowhere to be found.



"What's on your mind?" Myron caught the shift in her expression and strolled over, her heels dangling from his hand.
Millie shook off the old memories with an easy smile.Right now, all she wanted was to savor the moment.



She couldn't recall the last time she'd felt so unburdened,so light and playful.



Lately, it felt as if responsibility was welded to her shoulders.



Since losing her father, she'd barely allowed herself to breathe.



There was always something clamoring for her attention, always another crisis, another duty. The weight of it all never let up.



Instead of rejoining the splash fight, she wandered over to a weathered piano she'd spotted near the shore.



After drying her hands on her skirt, she let her fingers dance across the keys in a spontaneous melody.


Salt in the air, wild locks tossed by the wind, and a faint chill slipping through the quiet seaside dusk-she sat at the weathered piano, its keys untouched beneath the open sky. Beside her, the presence of someone who made her feel wholly herself made the moment luminous, something she wished she could keep forever.

For the first time in years, she felt a familiar lightness,as if she'd tumbled back into the bright,uncomplicated days of her youth.



When she finished playing, gentle applause drew her from her reverie.



She glanced over, catching his eyes,and answered his silent admiration with a soft, grateful smile.



The night breeze ruffled her hair, and for a beat,he simply watched her-captivated by the spark of joy and freedom she radiated.



In that small, ordinary instant, Myron realized he loved her in every version of herself.








Elsewhere, Jayceon lounged at home, determinedly coaching the cat.



"Kiki, you're the bravest hero in this house now," he declared, eyeing the chubby ragdoll cat with mock seriousness. "You can't just coast by on backflips if you want to win over Ari. We need to teach you more tricks," Jayceon said, trying not to laugh at the cat's sulky expression.



"Meow..." Kiki flicked her tail and turned away with a dismissive meow.
Undeterred,Jayceon gently spun the ragdoll back around to face him.



"That's what Myron's been saying all along. Listen up and start learning," Jayceon advised with a knowing look. He paused, tilting his head. "And don't pretend you don't adore Millie and Ari as much as the rest of us."



Kiki shot him a sideways glance, then let out a soft,begrudging chirp.



"That's more like it." Jayceon smirked as he tapped play on a video. "You see this? Come on, impress me -let's see what you've got!"



In the past, the cat would stubbornly resist whenever Jayceon tried to teach it this trick. This time, though,it seemed unusually motivated-ears perked and whiskers twitching with anticipation,even flashing its tiny teeth as if already practicing.



Before he could react, Jayceon's phone started buzzing.



He glanced down to see an unfamiliar number lighting up his screen.



His brother's warnings before he left home earlier tonight echoed in Jayceon's mind. He took a steadying breath and picked up.
"Yeah? Who is this?" he asked, keeping his tone casual.



A brisk, businesslike voice answered, "Mr. Elliott, we're with the press. We have exclusive footage that might interest you-if you're willing to make an offer."


Jayceon immediately pieced it together,remembering his brother's instructions. "What kind of footage are we talking about?" He pressed, keeping his voice steady.


"It's a video of Mr. Myron Elliott and Millie out together. A full-on date," the caller said, not bothering to beat around the bush.



Jayceon let out a dry laugh. "Oh, that? Myron told me not to do anything, so honestly, do whatever you want."



He ended the call without a second thought, and then turned his attention back to the cat, replaying the video and trying to teach it the new trick. With his other hand, he casually scrolled through trending entertainment news on a second phone, a smirk tugging at his lips. He could already picture the fallout and couldn't resist muttering, "Brandon's going to completely lose his mind over this."
The two paparazzi exchanged uneasy looks.



"So... what now?" one of them ventured, uncertainty in his voice.



"He said it's Myron's call, right? Myron probably saw this coming," the other replied with a shrug. Thney hesitated for only a moment longer before grinning."Screw it! Since we can't cash it, let's post the footage online. This explosive news comes from us, and it's still something."



"Agreed!"



"Just sit tight and take notes. I'll show you how it's done," the other replied with a cocky grin.




···



Meanwhile,as online speculation reached a fever pitch,a fresh video burst onto the scene.



The clip showed a couple goofing around on the beach-waves lapping at their feet, the woman launching playful splashes at the man, who never once lost his easygoing smile. Rather than retaliate, he simply gripped her heels and flicked water at her in gentle,harmless arcs, more teasing than truly trying to get her wet.



Anyone could see he was too smitten to ever actually
drench her, his every move full of affection and restraint.



But to the viewers' dismay, the camera work was maddeningly sly. Every angle managed to keep the woman's face hidden, her features always shielded as she darted away from the spray-leaving the public desperate for answers.



"These paparazzi are trolling us on purpose! Just give us a shot of her face already!"



"I'm losing my mind here! Where's the uncut footage with her face? Don't leave us hanging!"








Elsewhere, the poster gave a sly grin as he tapped out a new post-"100,000 likes to unlock the next video."



The top comment, racking up likes of its own, was dripping with disdain-"Unbelievable! What a shameless stunt!"



But the backlash only fueled the frenzy. Viewers hammered the like button anyway, blasting past a hundred thousand, then a million in no time, driving the hype into a frenzy.



"Damn, you really know how to work a crowd!" the other paparazzo blurted out, half impressed, half exasperated.
With a cocky little smile, his colleague dropped the next video. This time, it was Millie at the piano-but once again, her face stayed artfully hidden.


Unfazed,he posted a new message."When we hit 500,000 followers, I'll release every video-full face reveal and all."



Within seconds, the Internet exploded with a tidal wave of sarcastic comments and teasing memes.



The most upvoted comment shot straight to the point. "Cut the nonsense-just post the whole video already!"



Memes piled up in the replies. And speculation about the mystery woman's identity hit a fever pitch.



"I'm telling you, that's the McCoy heiress for sure."



"No way, it has to be someone from the Todd family."



"My guess? She's from some aristocrat family overseas!"



"Oh, please. Look at her style and figure. You can tell right away she's definitely not a foreigner."







Curiosity ran wild. People swarmed the account in droves, desperate to catch the first glimpse of the mysterious woman's face.



"Should we keep pushing this?" the man asked his colleague, practically vibrating with excitement as they milked every viral clip for clicks, securing a lucrative ad deal that required a commercial break right in the middle of the upcoming hotly anticipated face-reveal video. He was already rubbing his palms together, eager for the payout.



"If we drag this out any longer, we're bound to get burned." His colleague shot back, rolling his eyes.


At last, the long-awaited series of face-reveal videos dropped-triggering a nationwide frenzy.



"Wait-it's Millie!"



"The mystery's out-Millie was the one Myron was chasing all along!"



"Did I see that right? Oh, no-what about Brandon?"



The hashtag #MyronChasingMillie soon shot straight to the top of the trending charts, hijacking everyone's feeds.



Inside his apartment, Brandon sat rigidly in front of the glowing screen, watching as Millie's face flashed across every video, every headline. Fury snapped inside him-he swept his arm across the table, sending everything crashing to the floor, filling the air with a jarring racket.



Shards sliced his palm, and blood beaded, trailing down his trembling hand.



But the pain didn't seem to reach him-his eyes stayed locked on the video, unblinking and distant.
 

###Chapter 181 Brandon, We Are Over





The Internet was ablaze with discussion.



The drama surrounding the Watson Group, Brandon,Vivian, and Millie had captured everyone's attention.The paparazzi kept stoking the flames, promising even more revelations. The frenzy only grew,pushing the story to the top of every trending feed.



At Elliott Mansion, Jayceon was thoroughly enjoying the chaos.



"Well done!" he said with a big grin. "Let's push these videos to even more viewers."



He kept pumping money into boosting the clips,eager to drive up the views.


Between rounds of laughter, he showered the paparazzi with tips while his cat turned away,unimpressed.
The two paparazzi were thrilled as views surged and advertisers began lining up for ad placements in their next uploads.



"There's still plenty more to reveal. Aside from their date night, I've got other content ready to go," one of them said while editing.



The other watched in admiration. "You're seriously talented."



"You haven't even seen my best work," the first replied with a grin, diving back into his edits.



Online, the buzz only intensified.



"I heard Myron's been chasing after a mystery woman-turns out it's Millie! The way he looks at her is unreal."



"Millie hit the jackpot. First Brandon, now Myron?"


"She's living the dream. Please let me swap lives with her for a few episodes!"
By the sea, Millie and Myron were making their way back. Millie rinsed off the sand by the pool near the restaurant. Myron stood by, handing her a box of tissues.



"Thank you," she said, drying off.


He then offered her her heels.



She nodded and took them. Her gaze flicked to his damp hair, and she looked slightly apologetic.


"It's alright," he said, understanding her concern.He picked up a towel and dried his hair. "All good now."


Millie smiled faintly and nodded again.



"Alright," she said softly.



They headed inside together.



"We should probably head back," Myron said.

"Someone just uploaded videos of us here."



He showed her the page, watching her closely.



"Does it bother you?" he asked.
It wasn't the first time he'd asked this question tonight, and she had already said no.


Millie smiled. "Not at all."



She wasn't married anymore. She wasn't interfering in anyone's relationship either. She and Myron were both single. There was nothing to hide.



When she agreed to go out with him, she'd already made peace with the attention.


Besides, they were only getting to know each other.Nothing was official yet.



No rule said a divorced woman couldn't spend time with a single man.



With that thought, Millie looked at Myron. "Thank you for today," she said sincerely. "I really enjoyed it."



Myron smiled back. His expression was calm, but there was deep tenderness in his eyes. "Great, then."


As long as she was happy by his side, he was more than satisfied.

They left together.


Outside, more paparazzi had found them, and people were beginning to gather.


Myron had anticipated it. His bodyguards cleared a path as he shielded Millie and guided her to the car.They drove off quickly.


As night fell, Millie sat in the back seat, gazing at the city lights through the window. The steady flow of cars and people grounded her in the present. It felt real-unlike the surreal haze she'd felt earlier.



She lowered the window. The wind brushed her face.She took it in quietly.



Beside her, Myron watched her in silence.







The Bentley stopped outside Millie's apartment building.


As soon as the car came to a halt, she unbuckled her seatbelt and stepped out.
"Well then,I'll say good night," she said with a small smile.



Myron nodded. "Good night."


She turned and walked towards the building. Myron stayed by the car, watching until she disappeared into the building.


Millie entered the elevator, pressed her floor number,and watched the red digits rise. A strange feeling stirred in her chest.


The elevator chimed.


She stepped out and turned toward her apartment.But as she rounded the corner, she stopped.Someone was waiting outside her door.


It was a man-his eyes bloodshot, his face pale.


Brandon.



She had no idea how long he'd been standing there,but he looked tired and worn.



As soon as he saw her, he stepped forward.
Millie turned to leave, but he grabbed her shoulder.


"Millie," he said.


His gaze swept over her, taking in the blue dress.It was identical to the one in the videos online. His face twisted in fury.


"You were with Myron?" he asked, his voice cold.


Millie pulled her shoulder free.



"Yes," she said.



"What's that supposed to mean?"


She looked at him calmly in the dim hallway. His features were still as striking as ever.


"I should be the one asking questions," she said."Why are you here? Why do you care?"


Brandon swallowed hard, trying to stay composed."Why did you go out with him? What did you do?"


She stared at him, confused.


He had chosen someone else. So why was he standing here, asking questions about her new relationship?


Did he think that because she once loved him, she would remain loving him forever?


After everything-after the pain, after losing two children-did he expect her to still just wait for his return?



She wasn't that cheap. She wasn't that foolish.



"Brandon, we're divorced," she said firmly.


"Millie..." He tried to speak, but she cut him off."We're over. Do you understand?"


But he kept staring. His eyes were red.


"You just had dinner, right? That was all it was,wasn't it? The rest is just gossip, right?" It was as if he hadn't heard anything she'd said.



Millie closed her eyes. She didn't want to argue.


She turned to unlock her door, but he yanked her back and slammed her against the wall.
"Answer me!" he shouted, his voice hoarse, his eyes burning with anger.
###Chapter 182 You're Not Worthy Of Her
Brandon felt like he was on the verge of losing his mind.



None of it made sense. He couldn't understand how things had unraveled so fast.


He remembered Darden gossiping a few days earlier,talking about how Myron was pursuing a mysterious woman.A woman who had a child-a little girl.


He also remembered running into Myron at the mall.Myron was buying gifts for a little girl. And all those things he said about the woman he was pursuing.



At the time, those details hadn't meant anything.But now, everything made sense and pointed to Millie.


When had it started? Was it during the music show?Was that when the two of them began to cross paths and grow feelings?

He recalled the whispered comments from the Elliott trio and the look Myron had given him back then.


It all connected. And it was driving him mad.


"Millie, are you doing this on purpose?" His grip on her shoulder tightened. He wasn't even aware his reopened wound had stained her dress. "Is this because of what happened with Vivian-"


Before he could finish, someone yanked him back.


He turned, face twisted in fury, only to find Myron now standing between him and Millie.


"Myron!" The name tore from his throat. One look at him, and Brandon was nearly consumed by rage.


But Myron didn't even glance at him. He looked at Millie and said, "Your apartment didn't light up, so l came to check on you."


She hadn't messaged him like she usually did. That alone was enough to raise concern. He had circled the area, spotted Brandon's car parked in the shadows, and come straight upstairs.
"We've always kept to our own lanes, Myron. You-"Brandon began.


"Millie, go inside," Myron said gently, still ignoring him. "I'll take care of this."


Millie looked from one man to the other.


Only after Myron gave her a reassuring nod did she turn and unlock her door.


She had said everything she needed to.



She trusted Myron to handle what came next.



The door closed behind her with a gentle thud.



Now it was just the two of them.



Brandon stared at the closed door. His jaw was tight,and he looked as if he might lunge again.



"We don't need to make a scene here. Let's talk in the stairwell," Myron said, already turning to walk away.


Brandon didn't follow right away. He stayed rooted,
eyes still fixed on the door, his anger simmering.


But he knew Millie wouldn't open it again.


And Myron was still standing there, waiting.


After a long pause, Brandon took a deep breath,forcing himself to follow.


The stairwell was dim, lit only by the green glow of the emergency exit sign. The space was quiet,tense.


Brandon faced Myron for the first time with real hostility. Until now, he had only seen him as just another business rival. But this was personal.


"What did you do with her today?" he asked.


Myron's response was calm. "We went on a date."


Just those few words made Brandon feel like something inside him might snap.



"A date?"he echoed.



"That's right. It's not exactly a secret. Everyone online is now talking about it."
Brandon let out a sharp, bitter laugh. "You really think I don't see what you're doing? Your family has always been beneath mine. And now you're using her to get to me, trying to bring down the Watson Group?"


Myron didn't respond.


"Stay away from Millie," Brandon said, stepping forward.



Myron didn't flinch. He lowered his gaze slightly,and then looked back up.



"You've had more than your share of meals with Vivian," he said. "And you can't handle me having just one with Millie?"


As he spoke, Myron stepped forward until he stood toe to toe with Brandon.



"I do want my family to succeed," he said. "But that has nothing to do with me going out with Millie. I care about her. If I wanted to take you down, I have other ways. Trust me."
Brandon looked at him like he'd just heard the world's most absurd joke.



"You like her?" he scoffed. "Don't make me laugh."



"I do." Myron's smile turned cold. "It's not a joke. I told you before. I've liked her for a long time.I think about her day and night. And you should know you're not the only man in this world, and you certainly don't get to decide who's worthy of her."



He met Brandon's eyes, clear and unwavering. "I like the way she thinks. The way she carries herself.I respect her, even the parts that aren't perfect.I understand her better than you ever did. All you ever did was dismiss her."



Brandon's smile faded.



He said nothing,just stared.



Myron didn't break eye contact.



The silence stretched.



"Did she put you up to this?" Brandon finally asked.
Myron only laughed.



Something in that sound made the truth sink in.

Brandon exhaled,jaw tight.



"She was with me for seven years," Brandon said.



"|know."



"We had a child." Brandon clenched his fists.



"I know that too," Myron replied, his voice steady.


Brandon's chest rose and fell with each breath. He didn't look away.



"You think you know her better than I do? | spent seven years beside her, not you!" he spat. "She's mine. I've seen every side of her. I've held her through things you couldn't begin to understand."



He kept talking, the words pouring out like venom.


"When she cried in my arms, you were probably still out drifting on some yacht."



Myron's face darkened.
The glow from the sign above threw sharp shadows over his expression. He stepped forward, grabbed Brandon by the collar, and slammed him into the wall.


Brandon let out a breathless laugh. "That hit a nerve?" he whispered, bloodshot eyes full of fury."She's mine. And she always will be."


Myron looked at him. Then he smiled. But his eyes were cold.Ice cold.
###Chapter 183 Shut Your Filthy Mouth





Myron held Brandon against the wall with one hand.With the other, he pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and shoved it roughly into Brandon's mouth.



He jammed it in again and again.



"Filthy mouth like yours," he said. "Needs proper cleaning."



Brandon struggled violently. The two were evenly matched,but he finally managed to free one arm.



He ripped the handkerchief out and spat bloody saliva onto the floor.



They locked eyes, breath heavy, tension thick between them.Then Brandon laughed.



He lookedat Myron like he was seeing through him."What, that made you angry?" he sneered. "I only said the truth. Everyone in Crobert knows I was her husband. What's the point of all this?"


Myron's voice turned colder. "Everyone also knows you're divorced."



He pressed Brandon harder against the wall. "My feelings for Millie don't change because she was once married to you. If anything, I'm glad you lost her."



Brandon opened his mouth to reply, but Myron didn't give him the chance. He pushed harder, locking him in place.



"I don't talk about her the way you just did. Not to you,not to anyone."



He looked Brandon straight in the eye. "She hasn't agreed to be with me. Yes, it was just a meal. But that doesn't matter."



Myron's voice remained steady. "She walked away from you. And now she chooses to spend time with me. That's the reality-that's what matters. The woman you couldn't cherish, the one you tossed aside like nothing-she's a treasure to me. And not just to me." He leaned in slightly. "You made your choice, Brandon. You don't get to be possessive anymore. Especially not toward someone who no longer belongs to you."


With each word, Brandon's face grew darker.


Finally, he broke free of Myron's grip.


The two stood across from each other, silent in the dim stairwell, eyes filled with mutual contempt.


"She'll come back to me," Brandon said, voice low and raw. His eyes were bloodshot, almost wild. "You don't understand anything. She'll come back.We've been through everything together. You have no idea what that means."



Myron didn't flinch. "Maybe you did go through a lot," he replied. "But you still hurt her. You left her for Vivian. Did you ever stop to think what that did to her?"



He stared at Brandon, unwavering. "Sometimes I can't help but wonder," Myron said. "Did you ever actually love her? If you did, how could you do what you did?"


Brandon looked down. His hair fell over his face,hiding his expression in shadow.



"Don't come back here," Myron said. "Don't showN up at her door again. I'll make sure she's protected.Even if you bring the full weight of the Watson Group against me, I'll still stand right here. I won't let you hurt her again."



Brandon didn't speak. Half his body was hidden in the shadows.



Then, slowly, he lifted his head and looked at Myron.His fists were clenched, and the reopened wounds on his arms were bleeding again.



He studied Myron's face for a long time, as if trying to understand something he couldn't accept. But finally, he shut his eyes.


"You'll never understand," he said. He then turned and walked away.


As he passed Millie's door, he paused. He looked at it for a moment, but then lowered his eyes and walked to the elevator.


The corridor fell silent.


The green glow from the emergency exit sign flickered across his face, painting him in alternating light and dark.



He watched as the elevator descended. Then he bent down, picked up the crumpled handkerchief,and tossed it into the trash.



After a quiet moment, he stepped out of the stairwell and stopped at Millie's door.


He knocked twice, gently.


It opened a few seconds later. Millie stood in front of him.



"It's handled," Myron said with a quiet smile. "He won't come back."
Millie glanced down the hallway, toward the elevator.Then she nodded. "Thank you."



"Get some rest," he told her. His voice was gentle,but he didn't step any closer. "Goodnight."


"You too," she said. "Goodnight."


Then she hesitated and added softly, eyes lowered,"I've said it already, but... thank you again."


This time, hs smile deepened. "You don't have to thank me,silly."



She looked up at him. Under the warm light pouring out from her apartment, he looked calm and steady.Something about it left her feeling unsure of what she was feeling.



"You should go," she said. "Take care on your way back."



He nodded, gave her one more glance, and then turned to leave.



Millie stood at the doorway and watched him en 
the elevator. She didn't move for a while.



Only after the doors closed did she slowly turn, step inside, and close the door behind her.







Elsewhere, Brandon sped through the city.


The words Myron had said echoed in his mind, over and over, cutting into him.



Did he love Millie?



Of course he did.



How could he not?


The sound of the car engine felt distant, muffled beneath the weight in his chest.


He drove aimlessly. He didn't know where he was going.


Everything was slipping through his fingers, and he had no way to stop it.


He was in pain-deep, relentless pain-and didn't  know how to escape it.



He remembered what he had said earlier, how low he had sunk.



He couldn't stop thinking about her. Her tears. Her laughter. Her shy smile. Her trembling voice whispering his name during long, intimate nights.



How had it all fallen apart?


He didn't even recognize himself anymore.



The city lights faded as he reached the outskirts. The road was empty. He slammed the brakes.



The car skidded to a stop in the dark countryside.Only the sound of insects filled the air.


He leaned forward, forehead pressed to the steering wheel.Tears rolled down his face.



His lowered head brushed the horn. It blared loudly into the empty night.


A long, hollow sound. Like grief, spilling into the void.
"She'll come back," he whispered.


He didn't know who he was trying to convince.


"She hasn't said yes to Myron. She'll come back to me." Again and again, he repeated those words, as if saying them enough could make them true.
###Chapter 184 No Affair, No Insider Trading





After repeating the words several times, Brandon suddenly seemed to find strength.



He wiped the tears from his face, as if reaching a decision. Then he started the car and drove off.



At home, Millie sat alone on the couch.



She had overheard Brandon's conversation with Myron.



Though she had already stepped inside like Myron suggested, she sneaked out later and watched them from a distance, worried a confrontation might break out.



Her phone vibrated, puling her out of her thoughts.



She glanced down. Charles was calling.
After a moment's hesitation, she answered.



Charles asked about her date night with Myron, and she didn't hold back. She told him about the agreement she had with Myron.



"So, are you thinking of being with him?" Charles asked.



"I don't know," Millie said, her gaze resting on the lamp beside her. "We've only just started talking. It's too soon to tell."



"Millie..." Charles said her name, but then fell silent.


After a pause, he asked, "We're still friends, right?"


"Of course," she replied with a small nod. "We have been for a long timne."



"Good. I was afraid you'd leave me behind if you ended up with Myron and focus on your new relationship." Charles sounded relieved.


"Why would that happen?" Millie gave a soft laugh.


After the call ended, Charles stared at his phone in silence. Then, slowly, he smiled.


They had always been close friends and business partners. That wasn't going to change.


Not long after, Millie received another call. This time it was Alexia. She gave her friend the same explanation she gave Charles.


Once the calls were over, she went to freshen up.Then she turned her thoughts to the Elliott Group's latest product launches.







At the same time, Vivian sat fuming.



"Isn't Charles enough for her? Now she's dragging Myron in too, just to go against me?" She scoffed."Not happening."



She was too busy dealing with Eva for now. Once that was done, Millie would have no place left to stand.


Vivian already had a plan. That thought made her feel better.
As the online chatter kept growing, she reached out to Johnny.



Before long, a new topic began trending:#MillieMyronAffair.



The post tied together Jayceon's presence in each Heavenly Melody's live stage, Elliott Group's last minute sponsorship, and suspicions of insider trading. It hinted that Millie and Myron went a long way back and the Elliott family might be pulling strings behind Serena's success.



The rumor spread quickly, fueled by Johnny's team.


But just as the discussion was gaining traction,Myron made a public statement.



"There's no affair. No insider trading. My brother Jayceon is just a regular fan. And Serena's performance on Heavenly Melody truly impressed me. I only approached Millie after her divorce. I'm pursuing Millie now, but she hasn't agreed to be with me yet."
With Myron speaking up himself, the rumors lost momentum almost instantly.


People's attention shifted.He hadn't succeeded yet?



"I heard he was chasing some mystery woman.Now it makes sense"



"So it's Millie? And she hasn't said yes yet? Poor guy."



"The timeline fits."



"After watching Serena on Heavenly Melody, I get it.Anyone would fall for her."


No one questioned the timing or mentioned insider trading again. The audience still remembered the backlash Serena faced.



Her win had come from talent alone. No one doubted that anymore.



"Now I want to rewatch Heavenly Melody. It hasn't been that long, has it?"


"Me too. I'll keep an eye out for any scenes with Myron this time."







Later that night, just past 11 p.m., Brandon arrived at Moonlit Estate.



He parked quietly and walked toward the house where his grandparents lived.


They had asked him to come earlier.


When he arrived, Derek looked like he wanted to say something. But after seeing Brandon's expression,he held back.



Instead of scolding him, Derek simply exchanged a look with Norma.



After a long silence, Derek finally asked, "What was the news? Is any of it true?"


Brandon stood still, calm and composed. It was hard to believe he had broken down just hours before.



"Myron is pursuing her," he said in a steady voice."But I think they're simply working together. They want to win this bet and help her reclaim the Bennett assets."



Derek glanced at Norma. She looked thoughtful. "Is that how it is?" she said softly.



It seemed to them Myron was taking this seriously.


"Yeah," Brandon replied, his voice even.


"That's it. Good night, Grandpa. Good night,Grandma," he said politely. Then he turned and walked away.


As he stepped outside, something dripped down from his face.



He reached up. His nose was bleeding. He blamed the dry air.


But a moment later, his vision dimmed. Everything went black and he collapsed.


His grandparents rushed to call their family doctor.


After examining him, the doctor said, "He's just exhausted. He needs rest and proper care."

Derek and Norma exchanged a long, heavy look.







The sun rose quickly the next day, and time moved on.



Two quiet days passed.


That morning, Millie took Ari for her final check-up before the surgery.


Ari had already been admitted to the hospital two days earlier. If everything came back fine after today's exam, they could schedule a surgery for her.


Ari looked anxious. Her small hands were tightly clenched. She kept glancing up at Millie.



"Don't be scared," Millie said, crouching to meet her eyes. "I'll be right outside, waiting for you."


Ari gave a small nod.


" wish I could be like the other kids. Healthy and happy," she said softly.
Her biological parents had abandoned her because of her illness.



Millie pulled her into a gentle hug.


Just then, Giffard walked over and crouched beside them,smiling warmly.


"Don't worry, Ari. It will be over before you know it,"he said, patting her head.


"Dr. Hussain," Ari greeted him with a nervous smile.


Giffard nodded to both of them.



Later that afternoon, it was time for the operation.


Millie walked Ari to the entrance of the operating room and stayed there. Giffard gave her a reassuring nod. Millie managed a small, tense smile and waited quietly outside.


Meanwhile, a black Maybach rolled to a stop outside Crobert Federal Penitentiary. Once it parked,Brandon stepped out.
###Chapter 185 She Cast You Aside





Brandon found himself drawn once again to visit Hayden in his sterile prison environment.



They positioned themselves on opposing sides of the thick glass barrier, eyes locked in silent combat until Hayden broke the tension by lifting the phone first.



Brandon's eyes drifted downward momentarily before his own fingers wrapped around the receiver.



"What brings you back to this place again?"Hayden's voice carried through the static. "Tell me,did the divorce finally happen? Or did she refuse to sign?"



Brandon maintained his characteristic composure,though something fragile flickered behind his eyes."We completed the proceedings. But the truth is..."


His voice trailed off as shadows of sorrow clouded his expression.
"She craved freedom from the very beginning," he admitted quietly.


Hayden's interest sparked like a flame catching dry wood.



"Ah, so you believed you were the one seeking freedom, yet she was the one who cast you aside."Hayden condensed the painful truth into a single cutting sentence that sliced through Brandon's defenses.



Brandon offered no reply, choosing silence as his shield.



Hayden erupted into wild laughter, his body convulsing with cruel amusement. The sound echoed harshly through the visiting room as he threw his head back in pure amusement.



"How fascinating!" When his mirth finally subsided,he dabbed at the moisture in his eyes and continued,"This outcome never crossed my mind. I can still picture that day when you prostrated yourself before me, begging for her sake, while I looked down on you like you were nothing more than dirt beneath my feet.Back then, I was convinced you two shared a love so powerful it could conquer death itself."



Hayden's laughter erupted again, harsher this time."Yet here we stand, and it appears every sacrifice was completely meaningless."



Brandon maintained his stoic silence, refusing to take the bait.



Something sinister stirred in Hayden's memory,and malice crept into his tone. "Looking back on those events, it was your cunning deception that prevented me from completing my work; otherwise, she would have been utterly destroyed by my hands!"



Then, with a sneer that transformed his face into something grotesque, he continued, "Do you feel the sting of remorse for rescuing her that day? Wouldn't your life be infinitely simpler if you had simply allowed me to beat her to death? Now that-"



"I harbor no regret whatsoever," Brandon interrupted with quiet conviction.
"My presence here today serves a different purpose -to finally settle something within myself," he added with newfound resolve.



He was fully aware that today marked the scheduled date for Ari's critical surgery, but he also understood with painful clarity that Millie would never permit him to visit the child.



That realization had driven him to this visiting room instead.



Witnessing Hayden's twisted features had confirmed the conviction that had been growing steadily in his heart.



"Settle what exactly?" Hayden pressed with insatiable curiosity.



But Brandon refused to satisfy his morbid interest with an explanation.



He placed the phone back in its cradle with deliberate care. Ignoring Hayden's desperate attempts to draw him back into conversation, he rose from his chair and strode away with purpose.



He navigated his vehicle through the city streets and arrived at the hospital, where he settled into a quiet vigil in the parking area below.


He accepted his unwelcome status, so he contented himself with the possibility of glimpsing them from this safe distance.



... Within the hospital corridors, Millie paced with nervous energy while she waited for news,accompanied by Alexia, who had just ended her shift and came to provide emotional support.



After what felt like an eternity of agonizing suspense,the operating room doors finally swung open, and Ari emerged on a wheeled gurney, surrounded by medical personnel.


Millie rushed forward immediately, her maternal instincts overriding everything else.


She cast a worried glance at Ari, who remained unconscious from the anesthesia, and then lifted her eyes to meet Giffard's gaze with desperate hope.


Giffard's face broke into a reassuring smile as he nodded with professional confidence. "The surgical procedure proceeded exactly as planned without any complications."


Millie felt the crushing weight of anxiety finally begin to lift from her shoulders.



Together, they guided Ari's gurney toward the recovery ward, and Alexia moved closer, her voice soft with encouragement. "Everything will work out perfectly, Millie. As long as we provide her with proper care post-surgery, Ari will heal and develop into a child who's completely indistinguishable from any other. And the adoption paperwork has been progressing steadily through the legal system for quite some time now. Although the standard processing time typically requires approximately thirty working days, if all the bureaucratic elements align favorably, the entire process could be finalized in less than a month!"



Millie's head bobbed with enthusiastic agreement, her eyes glistening with unshed tears of overwhelming relief and joy.



Everything had progressed exactly according to their most optimistic expectations.


Soon, Ari would emerge from this ordeal completely healed, and once the legal adoption proceedings reached completion, they would transform into the authentic family she had always envisioned.


As their small procession approached the entrance to the general ward, they discovered Charles and Myron positioned near the doorway.



The two men had been engaged in quiet conversation, but they immediately ceased their dialogue upon witnessing the group's arrival.


"We heard about the surgery and came to check on Ari's condition," Myron explained, his voice carrying genuine concern.



Charles reinforced this statement with a firm,decisive nod of agreement.
Millie's guard remained completely lowered. With Ari's surgical procedure having concluded successfully and her spirits soaring with happiness,she felt generous toward everyone around her.


Giffard acknowledged both men with professional courtesy, though his attention lingered particularly on Myron. "The operation proceeded flawlessly without any complications. Under normal recovery circumstances, Ari should be medically cleared for discharge within approximately five to ten days."



A collective exhale of relief swept through everyone gathered.



Although Ari's medical condition could be successfully addressed through surgical intervention, everyone had still harbored deep-seated anxiety about potential complications.



"This calls for·a proper celebration," Charles declared with genuine enthusiasm brightening his expression. "We should all share a meal to commemorate this victory!"
Millie exhaled slowly, her practical nature asserting itself despite her elevated mood. "Perhaps we should wait until Ari actually walks out of this hospital."


Giffard voiced his agreement with a thoughtful nod.



Alexia's expression became a complex tapestry of conflicting emotions as her gaze settled on Myron with careful scrutiny.



Something fundamental had shifted during her absence that day when she had stepped away to the restroom. The memory nagged at her-she could distinctly recall how Millie had consistently rejected Myron's advances in the past.



Her eyes drifted toward Millie with a curious assessment. However, if Millie had genuinely developed feelings for him, that development could only be considered positive. He certainly appeared far more dependable and emotionally stable than Brandon had ever proven to be.



Everyone basked in the warm glow of shared happiness, while the final golden rays of sunset
streamed through the hospital windows, bathing the ward in warm, comforting light.


Meanwhile, Brandon maintained his solitary vigil in the parking area below until he witnessed the jubilant group descending for their dinner celebration, their faces radiating unmistakable joy. Brandon understood immediately that Ari's surgery had been triumphant.



He pushed open his car door and stepped onto the asphalt. After inquiring about Ari's room number at the information desk, he ascended to the appropriate floor and positioned himself at the doorway,his gaze penetrating the space within.


His eyes absorbed the scene of Millie and Myron seated beside the hospital bed. She moved a damp cloth across Ari's small hands with tender care while Myron cradled a water basin between his palms.


"Once Ari returns home, she'll lkely benefit from professional care assistance during her recovery period. My family has maintained relationships with exceptional caregivers for decades, or alternatively, you could request recommendations from the Hussain siblings. Their endorsement should guarantee exceptional quality service as well," Myron suggested thoughtfully.


Millie didn't dismiss the offer, continuing her tender ministrations as she responded, "That sounds reasonable. I'll arrange meetings with them and evaluate how well we might work together."


Their exchange flowed with natural ease, resembling the comfortable rhythms shared by couples who had grown accustomed to discussing practical matters together.


Brandon absorbed this intimate tableau in complete silence, eventually lowering his gaze and pulling back from the doorway.



He chose not to intrude upon their peaceful moment,instead turning away and retracing his steps toward the exit.



As Brandon's footsteps faded down the corridor,Millie experienced a brief pause in her gentle care of Ari's arm. She lifted her eyes toward the glass partition visible in her peripheral vision, and then redirected her focus back to her task.



She could have sworn a shadow had flickered behind the transparent barrier just moments before.But she might have been mistaken in her perception.







The days began flowing into one another with predictable rhythm, and life settled into its repetitive daily patterns.



During this extended period, Millie established permanent residence beside Ari's bedside,conducting all her necessary business from the confines of the hospital ward.



Ari progressed steadily toward complete recovery,her natural vitality returning with each passing day.



As Myron's visits increased in both frequency and duration, accompanied by regular appearances from Adriana and Jayceon, a distinctly mischievous sparkle began to dance within Ari's bright, observant eyes.


One particular afternoon, Ari posed an unexpectedly direct question to Millie. "Are you in a romantic relationship with Myron?"



Millie's eyes widened with surprise. What could such a young child possibly understand about the complexities of adult romantic relationships?



"I once overheard Alexia and Charles discussing how you wanted Myron to be my father," Ari explained,her eyes shimmering with the brightness of distant stars.



Millie considered the question with careful deliberation before responding, "So tell me honestly,do you believe you could accept him in that capacity?"


Ari devoted serious thought to the weighty question,and then bobbed her head with decisive approval and declared, "He seems perfectly acceptable to me.He has a gentle temperament, he looks good, and he draws. His cat has recently mastered some impressive new tricks, and Jayceon shared a delightful video with me."


Millie's laughter bubbled up spontaneously as she pressed a tender kiss to Ari's forehead. "You're absolutely enchanted by his cat, aren't you?"


Ari nodded with enthusiastic agreement. "Kiki demonstrates such remarkable intelligence!"


Just as the two were savoring their heartwarming exchange, a measured knock resonated against the ward door.
###Chapter 186 A Clever Move





Millie turned and saw Nicole, her mother.


She froze, uncertain of what to do.


The last time she had visited Nicole at the hotel,Nicole had asked her not to come again.


Over the years, Millie never quite knew how to approach her. Even though Nicole was her mother by blood, too much stood between them after James died.



After a pause, Millie spoke. "Mom."


Nicole glanced at her, gave a small nod, and stepped inside with a gift basket. She placed it on the bedside table.



"I'm here to see Ari," she said.


Millie nodded, pulled out a chair for her, and then turned to Ari, searching for a way to begin the conversation.



Before she could say anything, Ari called out brightly,her face lit by a cheerful smile. "Grandma!"


Nicole smiled back. "What a sweet girl!"


She began chatting with Ari, and Millie watched with a sense of disbelief.



She had never expected Nicole to come see Ari willingly.


After all, the mother and daughter had drifted apart after everything that had happened between them back then.


Ari laughed, clearly enjoying their talk.


When the conversation wound down, Nicole looked at Millie.



Millie understood and guided her to the smal balcony. Ari stayed behind, happily distracted with her toys.


From the balcony, they could still keep an eye on Ari while speaking privately.



"The adoption proceedings should be finalized soon," Nicole said.



Millie nodded. Her heart picked up pace, but she couldn't think of a response.



"I went to see him a few days ago," Nicole said after a moment.


Millie frowned. She knew who Nicole meant.Hayden.


The last time Millie herself had seen him was the day he was sent to prison.



Nicole went on. "I found out something. After thinking about it, I decided you should know."


"What is it?" Millie asked, puzzled.



"Brandon visited him twice lately. The first time was right before your divorce was about to be finalized.The second was on the day of Ari's surgery," Nicole said, watching Millie closely. "Have you really moved on from Brandon?"
Millie looked at her. Nicole's face still held faint traces of the beauty she once had,though hardship had softened them. This was the first time in a while she had said something that sounded like a mother speaking to her daughter.


Millie nodded. "I've moved on." She paused. "And I'm starting a new relationship."



Nicole didn't look surprised. "With Myron Elliott?"She must have seen something online.


"Yes," Millie replied.



Nicole gave a quiet nod.


"Do what feels right," she said. "I've told you what l came to say. I'll head back now."


Millie nodded and walked her to the door. After a moment's hesitation, she hurried to her bag, pulled out all the cash, removed her jewelry, and handed them to Nicole.



Nicole looked down at her hand, and then up at Millie.
Millie kept her head lowered and said nothing.


After a long pause, Nicole took the items without a word and walked away.


Millie watched her go.


This had always been their dynamic. Along with cash and jewelry, Millie had also given Nicole a card she occasionally topped up.①


Aside from the rift caused by Hayden's imprisonment, their relationship had remained distant.



Even so, Millie appreciated Nicole's help with the adoption paperwork.



Time moved quickly. Two more days passed.


Millie was having a meal with Ari when her phone buzzed.



A notification appeared. "Re-recorded version of 'Glimmer of Love' is released."



A re-recorded version?
Millie didn't know what had changed, so she tapped it open.



She saw the updated credits.



Before, it had read- "Glimmer of Love. Singer:Vivian. Lyrics: Vivian. CComposer:Vivian."


Now it said- "Glimmer of Love (Re-recorded Version). Singer: Vivian. Lyrics: Vivian / Eva.Composers: Vivian/Eva."①


There were only smnall changes. A few words in the lyrics. A brief shift in the composition.


The song still sounded much the same.


Millie found it amusing. What was Vivian trying to do?



Evans Entertainment had already completed the copyright registration to sue Vivian. The songwriting credit had been under Eva's name alone.



Everything related to the song-its performance data, Vivian's past statements, legal documents from Evans Entertainment-had been properly notarized and filed with the court. The evidence was secured.Even deleting anything wouldn't change that.Adding Eva's name now-did Vivian think that would somehow fix things?



They hadn't filed the lawsuit against Vivian earlier simply because they were waiting for the mini-series -Love of Vivian-to launch. A bigger payout was more likely after that. It had never been about lacking preparation.



Vivian posted a message on her social media. "The earlier version I recorded felt immature. It had many flaws. I've since trained with a vocal coach and created a re-recorded version. I hope everyone enjoys it."


Millie didn't care about the re-recording itself. What caught her attention was how Vivian planned to explain the new credits.


Clearly, she wasn't the only one curious. Online discussions had already begun.


"Who is Eva? Why is there a second name on the lyrics and composition?"


"| thought Vivian wrote it all herself. Who's this Eva?"


"Can someone explain why the credits changed?"


Someone eventually replied with an explanation.



"Eva is the musician who helped with the re-recording," the user wrote. "The changes are small.Just a few tweaks to the lyrics and composition. The new version was recorded at Evans Entertainment's place,and Eva works there."


With that, people seemed to understand.


"So Eva helped with the re-recording and Vivian added her to the credits? Vivian is so kind!"



The online conversation continued. Some thought Eva was taking advantage of the situation. Others praised Vivian for her generosity.


Millie was surprised by how people reacted.


The story made it sound like Vivian had done most of the work. Eva's name was there as a courtesy.
This spin worked in Vivian's favor. It painted her as gracious and uncompetitive.


A clever move, indeed.


Still, Vivian probably hadn't expected how prepared they really were.


Just then, the phone of Eva buzzed with a call.


It was Vivian calling.


###Chapter 187 You're Asking For Whatever Comes Next
Evans Entertainment kept Millie's identity as Eva locked under a strict confidentiality agreement.


To shield her from exposure, all contact with Eva was routed through Charles' team, ensuring nothíng about Eva would lead to Millie.



Once, Millie had asked Charles about Vivian's string of phone numbers.



Vivian maintained several external lines, but the one she'd used to reach Serena-the same she used to call Eva now-was registered under someone else's name. Vivian clearly took her precautions seriously.


Taking a moment to gather her thoughts, Millie answered the call.


Vivian's voice crackled through the line. "Eva? It's Vivian."
Coughing lightly, Millie feigned a lingering cold,pitching her voice low and scratchy.


"What is it?" she rasped, shooting Ari a quick look before slipping onto the balcony.



"Have you checked out the trending topics today?"Vivian's tone brimmed with self-satisfaction, as if she'd been waiting all day to gloat over her handiwork. This had clearly been a plan in the making.



Millie slid the balcony door shut behind her and spoke in a rough voice, "I saw everything."


Vivian's tone sharpened, brimming with self-assurance. "So, are you finally willing to hand it over?If you're smart about this, I'll see to it you get paid handsomely-and I'll even help you launch your own brand."



Not once did Vivian mention "credit" directly. She skirted the word, talking only in careful code.


Millie saw right through her.
With a low, scratchy laugh, Millie remarked, "If you mean credit, just say it. Why bother with all these charades?"



川 never said anything about credit. If you want to twist my words, there's nothing I can do about that,"Vivian deflected without missing a beat.



She quickly circled back, laying on the enticement."Let's get back to the point. Eva, you must realize-Charles and Millie are thick as thieves. Evans Entertainment is only going to pour resources into her.Helping Charles will get you nowhere.Partnering with me, though, that's your boest move. And about your contract drama with the Evans? Watson Group can make all that disappear."


She spoke as if the deal was already done, certain Eva would cave.



But Millie's ragged voice cut in coldly, "I told you, l'm not selling it. No means no. Vivian, are you even aware that you're breaking the law?"


Vivian let out a cool laugh.
"I'm not breaking any laws, she replied her voice dropping to a low, confident pitch. Let's be blunt-who actually cares what you say online? None of it matters."



She paused, her tone growing a shade sharper."Besides, I haven't done a thing wrong."


Millie instantly caught the subtext.



By now, Eva's name had already been tacked onto the official credits for both lyrics and melody of "Glimmer of Love." With Vivian's relentless PR blitz,public opinion had shifted-most people believed Eva had made a minor contribution, while Vivian was celebrated as the true genius behind the song.



Vivian's PR machine was ruthless. If Eva ever tried to defend herself, Vivian could easily paint her as a grasping nobody who wanted all the glory despite barely helping at all.



That was how the weight of the public opinion could suffocate a lesser-known musician like Eva.
The moment the line went quiet, Vivian's lips curled in a smug smile.


She'd already mapped out every angle-if Eva dared produce evidence of copyright, Vivian could just insist the recording originated in Evans Entertainment's studio, and that, as a clueless newcomer, she'd only invited Eva to help her rehearse.



She would then claimed Eva had handled the copyright registration for her. As for why Vivian's name didn't appear on the paperwork, she could always accuse Eva of exploiting a loophole.


Such dispute would have to be settled in court, and that kind of legal battle dragged on for ages. By the time the truth came out, Eva would've missed her chance to turn things around.



Vivian spoke with a slick, practiced confidence. "So,have you made up your mind? If you're willing to work with me, you can still walk away with something. Wait too long, and you'll get nothing."
Millie only laughed. "Not interested."


Vivian seemed genuinely surprised. "Eva, come on.Even if you take this to court, at worst, I pay a penalty and move on. The lawsuit will take forever. Why not just take the money and the resources I'm offering?It's a win-win."



Millie didn't bother replying. She ended the call, her smile lingering as she stared at the screen.



Millie knew Vivian was relentless, and she also knew Vivian wouldn't back down so easily.



Part of her was almost eager to see what reckless move Vivian would make next.



At first, Vivian could plausibly argue she hadn't intended to infringe-that she believed she'd bought the song and had every reason to call it her own.


But now, Vivian was well aware she was in the wrong.She still refused to admit fault or apologize, doubling down and scrambling to muddy the truth by tacking Eva's name onto the credits.

 That was a crucial distinction-deliberate infringement meant far steeper penalties.


Millie considered Brandon's temperament. If he sensed any real threat to a project, he'd cut his losses without hesitation. But what if Vivian insisted on charging ahead regardless?


Millie's lips curved in a cold, inward smile. "Fine,then. You're asking for whatever comes next, Vivian."


She pressed her right hand into a tight fist, steadying herself, and then slipped back into the hospital room and forced her mind back to the task at hand.



In just a few days, the Elliott Group's first wave of new products would hit the shelves. She had a launch to orchestrate-and she intended for it to be a resounding success.







After several days of rest and treatment, Brandon's strength had finally returned.


He sat up, the lines of fatigue on his face graduallying, and tapped his index finger against the tablet in his lap-a new version of "Glimmer of Love" filling the screen. Vivian hovered beside him, all innocence and wide-eyed charm.



"So what exactly are you trying to pull?" Brandon's voice was low, edged with exasperation.



Vivian met his gaze, a mask of sweet innocence firmly in place.



"Brandon, I already added her name, didn't l?" she said, blinking as if genuinely baffled. "Didn't you say there were issues with infringement? Well,now that her name's there, isn't it resolved?"



Brandon pressed his fingers to his temple, already feeling the dull throb of a headache.


"That's not how it works. The right of authorship is rightfully hers and hers alone, Vivian. This isn't about simply tacking her name on after."



Vivian paused, and then slipped her arm through his and gently guided him to sit on the couch beside her. Listen, Brandon," she began, her tone soft but determined. "You're missing the point. If we leave only Eva's name on the credits, it's basically admitting the infringement was real in the first place."


Her tone turned grave as she went on, "If I do that,everything I've worked for-my entire public persona -will go up in smoke."


She hesitated, her gaze unwavering. "And it means lose."



Brandon knew exactly what she meant. That was why he'd tried to persuade Eva into signing a non-disclosure agreement. But with Eva refusing, the issue remained a ticking time bomb.



To Brandon, the only way to cut their losses was to pull the plug on the "Love of Vivian" project entirely.


Vivian, however, wouldn't budge.


The whole mess left Brandon massaging his temples,exhaustion in his eyes.


Vivian studied him, lips curling into a measured smile. "I've added Eva's name now, haven't l? I'm not shutting her out-I'm giving her credit for her work."


Her voice carried a brisk finality. "We pay her, we offer her some resources. With her name on the song and money in her pocket, there's no reason for her to feel slighted anymore."


Flashing a practiced smile, she stated firmly,"Brandon, this is the best possible outcome-for all of us."



Brandon's gaze flickered with unease as he studied Vivian.



He could see her entire scheme teetered on one condition-Eva's cooperation. Without it, they were wide open to accusations of infringement.


"So, are you still set on pushing ahead with the 'Love of Vivian' project?" he asked, his tone careful.


Vivian's answer came without hesitation. "I am." Her chin lifted, her defiance unyielding. "Brandon, I'm not backing down. Even if you walk away, I'll keep moving forward on my own."


For her, "Love of Vivian" wasn't just another project-it was her one shot at making it big.


Eva, on the other hand, was nobody important-a struggling singer forced to hawk her songs for a living, even enduring the sweltering heat in a suffocating mascot costume justto scrape by. The image flashed in Vivian's mind and only hardened her resolve.



As far as Vivian was concerned, Eva was just stalling,angling for a bigger payout before she caved. This drawn-out battle of wills was nothing more than posturing for leverage.


In Vivian's mind, there was no real threat here.Sooner or later, Eva would fold.


Handling her would be a breeze.
###Chapter 188 The Same Emergency Contact
Vivian saw no need for another meeting with Eva; at this point, it was just a meaningless gesture.


In her mind, Eva's name was already listed as a contributor-if Evans Entertainment or Eva herself wanted to stir up drama, she'd paint the whole thing as a desperate attempt by a nobody to chase clout.



Besides, she had the perfect scapegoats lined up. If things got messy, Vivian could simply claim the entire debacle was a calculated ploy masterminded by Millie and Charles.



In Vivian's mind, the cleanest outcome was Eva quietly pocketing the money. But if Eva refused and forced things into court, VVivian wasn't worried.


By the time any legal storm settled, she'd be comfortably married to Brandon, protected from any 
fallout.



Her confidence swelled-her plan was airtight and nothing could go wrong.


Back at the hospital, Millie tucked Ari in and went to double-check the copyright registration for her song.



She couldn't shake a nagging sense of confusion.



What exactly was Vivian aiming for?



The copyright registration was as clear as day and Eva would win in court without breaking a sweat.



The infringement wasn't really massive, and if Vivian could drag things out with high-powered attorneys,at worst, she'd end up with a slap on the wrist-a public apology, a fine, and an end to the unauthorized use. StiIl, Vivian's public image would be shattered regardless.



Was Vivian really so hell-bent on winning that she'd risk her entire reputation, justfor the chance to marry Brandon before her time ran out? Did she actually believe she could control the timing and twist things in her favor?


Millie couldn't make sense of it. No matter how she looked at it, Vivian's scheme seemed self-destructive.







Meanwhile, Brandon gave up trying to change Vivian's mind and drove away, frustration simmering beneath the surface.



As he passed the psychiatric clinic where he and Vivian had once visited, a memory surfaced-the doctor had said some documents would be mailed to his place. But up until that very morning, nothing had arrived.



Uneasy, Brandon pulled over and walked into the facility, hoping to get answers. At the front desk, he learned the doctor he needed was out for the day.


With a patient sigh, he laid out his issue to the receptionist. "Documents are usually processed by the archive.You can check with them," the receptionist advised,gesturing politely.


Brandon gave a silent nod and stepped out, missing the hushed exchange between the receptionist and a nearby staff member as soon as the door swung shut behind him.



"Isn't that new guy stationed in archive now?"


"Yeah. He used to mess things all the time in his old department. After a huge blowup with his supervisor,they shipped him off to records. But he's still making a mess over there-no one can keep up with his screw-ups. Honestly, I'm tired just thinking about it."


"Let's hope that gentleman gets his paperwork sorted."



As their conversation lingered in the air, Rita came over, catching the end of it. "What's going on?" she asked, her tone light but curious.


The receptionist perked up instantly."Oh,Rita,let me fill you in..."


By then, Brandon had already made his way to the archive.



He found a young man sprawled lazily across a chair,barely keeping his eyes open.


Brandon's brow furrowed as he stepped closer.


"I'm here to inquire about a mailed document," he said, his tone even but edged with impatience.


The man behind the desk barely stirred-he looked half-awake,bleary-eyed, rubbing sleep from his face as if it would clear his mind. "What are you looking for?" he mumbled, blinking at Brandon.


"| haven't received a document I was expecting. I'd like to check its status," Brandon replied, voice clipped but polite.



"Okay," the man grunted, massaging his temples before fumbling for his glasses. He perched them crookedly on his nose, logged into the mail tracking system, and glanced up. "Name?"
"Vivian Simpson," Brandon answered automatically,assuming they wanted the patient's name.



As the man began typing, Rita strode in, her heels striking the floor with quiet authority.



"What's going on here?" she asked, giving both men a sharp look.



The man straightened instantly, suddenly alert."A patient's family member is here to check the status of a mailed document," he said, eager to explain.



Rita's expression shifted-she'd already heard about why Brandon was here from the receptionist.


In her mind, she replayed the scene from the other day when Vivian had left the doctor's office with Brandon and then come back alone, deep in conversation with the doctor.


While Rita couldn't recall every detail, she suspected they'd discussed changing the delivery address.


Brandon, meanwhile, seemed completely in the dark. "I understand," Rita said calmly. "Please check what went wrong."


"Right away, Dr. Carpenter," the man replied,springing into action. After a moment, he turned to Brandon. "The document's already been sent out and signed off."


Brandon's brow furrowed as he pressed. "But I never received it."



"Verify the address to see if there was any mistake,"Rita directed, her tone steady but firm.


"On it!" The man double-checked, and then read out the destination, finishing with, "Vivian Floral Design,Vivian Simpson."


"That's the address on record," he said, shooting a quick, uncertain look at Brandon.


Brandon kept glancing at Rita, unsettled by the strange undercurrent in her demeanor.



When the man read out the delivery address however, Brandon's gaze sharpened. Had he gotten it wrong?



He was certain he'd given his own address-so how did the document end up at Vivian's studio?



The man looked up and inquired, "Is something wrong,sir?"


Brandon forced a tight smile and shook his head.


"Can you print another copy for me right now?"Brandon asked, hoping to collect it in person and avoid the hassle of waiting for mail again.


"Of course, sir. But I'll need to verify your identity first," the man replied with a calm tone.



Brandon gave a slight nod and handed over his ID without hesitation.



As the man started to key in Brandon's name, Rita quickly stepped in. "You'll find the authorization notes faster in the patient's medical record. If the recipient was able to receive the mail, there should already be a record of it."
The man offered a quick nod, pulled up Vivian's medical file, checked the necessary details, and,after confirming the authorization, returned the ID to Brandon. "Please hold on. I'll print it for you now."


"Thanks," Brandon said, slipping his ID back into his wallet.



Relief washed over Rita, though she kept it hidden.


She reminded herself that she needed to call Milie to update her emergency contact-something they'd clearly let slip through the cracks.



Brandon had always been listed as Millie's emergency contact.


Since her health was steadily improving and she rarely needed to reach out to anyone for medical emergency, nobody had bothered to update the information. But overhearing the receptionist's casual chatter jolted Rita into sudden unease-a flash of dread tightening her chest.


The man in the archive had a reputation for : carelessness. Rita couldn't shake the worry about what damage he might uInwittingly cause.


He'd already earned himself a string of blunders back when he worked the front desk.



If he decided to look up Brandon's name in the system and accidentally accessed Millie's confidential file, it would be a clear violation of patient privacy-something the clinic was supposed to protect at all costs.


Worse, Rita knew Millie would never want Brandon to find out she'd been seeing a psychiatrist.


If that detail slipped out, it would be a catastrophic lapse for the facility.


Luckily, Rita had kept her guard up and intervened just in time.


If she hadn't, things could've easily spiraled out of control.



At last, the records clerk finished printing, slid the document into a folder, and passed it across the counter to Brandon.



"Thanks" Brandon murmured, and then requested the man update the address back to his own apartment.


Rita lingered silently nearby, keeping her expression neutral.


She made sure her gaze never drifted toward the computer monitor-she hadn't caught a glimpse of any confidential details.


After the paperwork was sorted out, Brandon walked off with the folder tucked under his arm.



Rita grabbed a few supplies from the archive,feigning a casual errand as she slipped out.


But just as she turned the corner, she nearly collided with Brandon.



He blocked her path with a measured look. "Do you have a minute to talk?" he asked.


###Chapter 189 He Can't Let Go Of Millie





Rita clutched the documents in her hands and gave a nod. Then, she and Brandon moved to a quiet corner of the corridor.



"I heard you're a doctor here." Brandon spoke first.



Rita nodded again in confirmation.



"What exactly do you want to ask me?" She looked at him. "Or... what's been troubling you?"


Brandon stared at her for a moment. Finally, he said,"I'm confused about something."



Rita gave another nod, signaling for him to go on.


But Brandon's gaze didn't stay on her. He looked somewhere distant, his expression tight.


"If I love someone deeply, but I've also hurt her badly...What should I do?" he asked.
Rita looked at him, unsure if he was referring to Millie.



"What choices do you have now?" she asked gently.


"She wants to leave, but I don't want her to go.I want her to stay with me, so l used some... methods to keep her." His voice lowered. "Shameful methods."


He fell silent. Then, turning to her again, he asked, "If it were you, what would you do?"


Rita let out a long sigh. "Loving someone doesn't mean chaining them to your side. If she wants to go,let her. If you truly love her, could you bear to see her hurt? If being with you only causes her pain...Wouldn't letting go be the kinder choice?"


They stared at each other, the silence between them filled with unspoken emotions.


From the outside, it might have seemed like there was a clear answer. But Brandon wasn't ready to accept it.


Only now did he realize-it was never that Millie ---couldn't let go of him. it was ham who couldn't let go of Millie.



But she had already made her choice. She had chosen Myron.


After a brief pause, he nodded.


"Thank you," Brandon said, and then took the file folder and left.



He sat alone in his car, lost in thought.


Lately, his temper had gotten the better of him.Things had spiraled.



It was time to make things right.


With a long breath, he pulled out his phone and called Eugene.



"Mr. Watson?" Eugene answered quickly.


"Notify all relevant departments to draft a plan. We need to sever all connections between Vivian and Watson Group," Brandon said calmly.
"Huh?" Eugene sounded confused.


"Any issue related to the recent stock fluctuation-and any of Vivian's future projects-must be kept completely separate from the Watson Group. No overlap, no mutual impact," Brandon said. His voice was steady again, like his old self.


Vivian's project was too much of a gamble.


He had warned her, but she kept going. He couldn't stop her. So, he had to cut ties to save the Watson Group.



"Also, set up a new back-up project for her. Make sure the funds are handled properly," Brandon added.



That was his final gesture of leniency toward Vivian.


As for Millie... He lowered his gaze, not daring to think too far.



He hoped time would soften the edges.



Just as he was about to start the engine, he spotted the doctor who had handled Vivian's diagnosis.



It felt like the right time to clear some doubts.


Brandon stepped out of the car and walked over.


The doctor now had his back to him, chatting with someone over the phone.



"Yeah, we're only able to cover up this much. Even though it's a private facility, and we've got more leeway, we still can't forge a full diagnosis without any symptoms. Last time, someone wanted a fake their medical record too, but they'd actually slit their wrists-so that was easier to explain. If your-" the doctor said.



Brandon hadn't meant to eavesdrop. But at the mention of wrist-slitting and fake medical records,he froze.



Could it be Vivian?



He then remembered the mailing issue.


Had she changed the address on purpose-to stop him from getting the report?


Without a word,Brandon turned and left. He called Eugene again.


"Mr. Watson?" Eugene answered.


"Look into who Vivian has been spending time with recently. Also, investigate the psychiatrist who handled her case," Brandon said.



"Understood." Eugene got to work immediately.


Brandon returned to the car, his brows furrowed as he stared at the document he had just received.



Was Vivian faking it?



He started the engine and drove off.







Time passed quickly.


One day, as Brandon was heading to Watson Group,a notification lit up on his phone. "Breaking: Millie and Myron spotted getting cozy."
The photo showed them on a yacht, out at sea,fishing together.



But it wasn't your typical fishing trip.


They were holding the same pole, pulling something up from the water. They stood close-too close.


Brandon's phone buzzed again.



It was Darden. "Hey buddy, did you see the news?Millie and Myron went sea fishing."


Brandon stared at the message for a moment, and then replied, "I saw it."


Darden messaged again. "But didn't you say she was busy with her adopted daughter? Why's she out there fishing with him?"



Brandon didn't answer.



He got the address and drove straight there.


Millie and Myron were returning with a cooler full of fish.
"I didn't think we'd catch so many!" Millie said, wide-eyed with surprise.


Myron had invited her on their second weekly date.



She almost turned it down. The new product launch was tomorrow, and Ari was still in the hospital.


And who went sea fishing on a date anyway?



It had been five days since Ari's surgery. Doctors suggested five to ten days of close medical observation, and Millie wanted her to stay a little longer just to make sure she was really fine.



" already thought of that," Myron had said with a smile when Millie voiced her concern. "I've got a beach house nearby. A doctor and a chef are already there. We'll take Ari along, and after fishing, we'll cook and eat together."



He even consulted Alexia and her brother, making sure Ari's health could handle such an outing.



In the end, it became a group outing.

They split into teams and turned it into a competition.


Alexia shouted in excitement with every catch, and with Giffard beside her, they also caught quite a lot.But the stars of the day were Millie and Myron.


Their cooler was the fullest by far.


As they walked back along the deck, Millie stepped on a slick patch of water and lost her balance.


"Careful!" someone shouted. In a flash, Myron caught her arm, steadying her.


Millie gasped and instinctively held onto him. It looked like she had fallen right into his arms.


Just then, she felt something sharp-like needles pricking her skin.


She turned around. Brandon was standing nearby,parked along the shore, eyes fixed on her.


He was watching everything.
###Chapter 190 Was It Truly Time To Let Her Go
Millie had already regained her balance and let go of Myron.


By then, their yachts had pulled in, and the dock workers quickly came over to help unload their catch.


"Easy, easy! No need to rush!" Alexia shouted with excitement. "Let's count everything first. We need to know which team got the bigger haul!"


With Myron's help, Millie stepped off the yacht.


She looked up again, searching the shore, but Brandon,who had just been watching them, was nowhere to be found.



For a moment, it felt like she'd imagined the whole thing,causing her to frown in confusion.


In her baffled state, Myron's voice came from beside her. "You weren't mistaken. It really was him."



Millie glanced at Myron, who responded with a soft,reassuring smile.


"I'm not sure why he just looked over and left,"Myron added with a thoughtful expression in his eyes. "Maybe something finally clicked for him."



Millie gave a thoughtful nod, and then said, "Let's not overthink it. We're here to have fun! Didn't you say a top chef's coming to cook for us tonight? We should enjoy a proper feast!"



Myron nodded. "Absolutely."


They then shared a knowing smile.


Millie reminded herself to eat well tonight. She'd need the energy for tomorrow's product launch,which would be anything but easy.


She had suggested to Myron earlier that they reschedule their weekly date, but he had insisted on keeping today's plan.
She understood why. He wanted her to unwind. And that was likely why he hadn't made it a private date.He had also invited her friends along for the fishing trip.



That gesture, more than anything,helped her relax.



"Wow!" Alexia's voice rang out as she rushed over to where Millie and Myron were chatting.


"Millie, that fish you caught was massive! How did you pull that off?" Her eyes sparkled with genuine astonishment.



Millie chuckled, brushing off everything else on her mind."I almost ended up in the water."



Myron nodded beside her. "It yanked on her line so hard, I nearly didn't catch her in time."



Laughter broke out among the group, lightening the mood as they relived the moment.


Meanwhile, nearby, Brandon sat in his car with a cigarette burning between his fingers.
Rita's voice echoed in his mind, "If you truly love her,could you bear to see her hurt? If being with you only causes her pain... Wouldn't letting go be the kinder choice?"



The rising smoke curled around him, casting a lonely air over him.



Millie's smile popped up in his head. The radiant smile he had just seen.



She hadn't smiled like that around him for a long time.



Was it truly time to let her go?


He didn't have the answer. And deep down, he didn't want one.



Cigarette butts lay scattered near his car door, while laughter and music drifted from the lively seaside villa.



Inside, the people shared a meal and played games.Through the French windows, he could see her dancing with Myron. And next to their moving figures sat the small outline of a child, watching.


They were happy.



She looked content.



Alexia's loud, out-of-tune singing resonated from afar.





Everyone was wrapped in happiness. Everyone but Brandon.







Meanwhile, online forums were heating up with chatter about Elliott Group's upcoming product launch.



"Did Millie and Myron really go out sea fishing to celebrate the new product? That's gutsy! Already popping champagne? What if it all crashes tomorrow?"



"Right?! I heard from a source that this time, Millie is not just the spokesperson, she actually led the project. The entire marketing plan was her idea."
"Seriously? Does she even know anything about marketing? Wasn't she just Brandon's personal assistant for years?"


"We'll see soon enough. If things flop, Vivian will have a field day laughing."







The product launch had stirred interest from all directions, especially from Vivian.



She stayed confident in her judgment.


"Millie barely accomplished anything while she was with the Watson Group. How could she suddenly shine now?" Vivian said to her caregiver. "I bet Myron is trying to impress her by handing her everything.Those designs and marketing strategies aren't even hers. Once I call her out on cheating, she'll be left with nothing."


The caregiver nodded along, though she didn't quite understand.

 
However, Vivian wasn't willing to leave things to  chance. She reached out to Johnny, arranging a little "surprise" for Millie on launch day.







At Moonlit Estate, Derek and Norma scrolled through the online chatter, shaking their heads at the drama.



"If Millie really ends up with Myron, what will Brandon do?" Derek asked.



"He might lose his mind..." Norma murmured.



Derek nodded.



"Back then... things almost turned out differently." He left it at that.



"Let it be," Norma concluded. "We've done what we can."







In a hotel suite, Egbert swirled a glass of red wine in hand, scanning the online buzz with an amnused smile.
"Millie... after all these years, you still have so many admirers. But of all people, why him?" he murmured to himself. "Someone that dangerous.."


His thoughts drifted to the moments he'd crossed paths with Myron. The man always seemed to play fair,yet somehow came out ahead. And he was often wearing that cheerful, unbothered smile that could drive anyone mad.


"But, I hope you succeed," Egbert said with a smile."Out of everyone, I trust you more. And, I feel... It's time to add a little spice for tomorrow and the future."







At the seaside villa, Millie and Myron sat side by side on the cool sand, letting the breeze wash over them.


"Are you nervous about tomorrow's launch?" Myron asked.



Millie took a slow sip of her drink, feeling the wind brush against her skin. "I am."
"You don't look nervous," Myron said with a chuckle.



Millie turned to him, raising her eyebrows. "What about now?"



Myron didn't respond, and she gave a faint smile."This launch is my chance to win back what rightfully belongs to the Bennett family. Of course I'm anxious."



Myron's gaze softened. He reached out and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, which was blowing across her face. "There was a time, back at the Flesta border, when I crossed paths with someone completely reckless. My airline route was at risk, and I was on edge. But in the end, things worked out perfectly. That person was nothing like what l'd heard about him. He had changed by then, and our partnership went surprisingly well."


Millie laughed. "You're talking about Egbert, aren't you?"


Myron nodded with a faint smile. "You figured it out."
He added, his deep eyes fixed on Millie 'I also heard that it was you who changed him. If you could handle someone like him, then this launch is nothing in comparison. Everything has been double-checked,and the whole team believes in the plan. Just trust me, Millie. You will succeed."


Millie met his eyes, finding strength in the way he looked at her.


After a moment, she nodded.
###Chapter 191 The Spark Of Love





Time passed in a blur.



Before long, a new day had arrived.


Overnight, heated discussions and growing anticipation had already informed most people that today marked the launch of Elliott Group's newest collection.



The company had always been a leader in the gemstone industry. It sourced a wide range of gems from around the world.



If someone wanted something rare, chances were Elliott Group could provide it.


Its focus had long been on high-end offerings,including exclusive auctions for custom gemstone pieces.


This time, the release was rumored to fall somewhere between mid-range and luxury. But that wasn't entirely accurate.



Word was spreading about a rare pink diamond said to be the highlight of the collection.


That, however, would come later. For now, all eyes were on the opening moments.



Everyone was watching to see if Millie could start strong.



But just before the product launch, something else captured the public's attention. A short video began to circulate online.



In it, a priceless blue diamond sank into the ocean's depths. A sleeping mermaid discovered it. She studied it with wide eyes, and then flicked her tail and swam upward toward the light.



As she broke through the surface, sunlight struck the gem.It shimmered in her hand.


She didn't notice the prince behind her. Then she turned. The camera paused as their eyes met. The blue of the gem matched his gaze exactly.


It was a simple but striking scene. The moment hinted at the beginning of a love story. The tone aligned perfectly with the symbolic meaning of a blue sapphire-tranquility, passion, and romance.


The entire video lasted less than thirty seconds. The cast featured unfamiliar faces, yet their performances were believable and engaging.


Although the storyline seemed predictable, the execution was exceptional. There was no dialogue,but the emotion was clear.


Viewers were stunned. For many, it was the most memorable piece to come out of the entertainment world in years.



Speculation began immediately.



"Is this from a new drama?"



"None of the actors look familiar, but they're perfect for the roles. What show is this?Ineed to watch it."

  Then someone caught on. "Wait a minute-doesn't Elliott Group have a launch today? Could this be part of their campaign?"


Another person disagreed. "That can't be it. There's no logo anywhere. Besides, isn't Millie their spokesperson? If this was official, wouldn't she be featured?"



"You're right. That makes sense."







Vivian and Johnny's team had also seen the video.



Everyone assumed Millie would appear in anything tied to the new release. Her absence made the connection to Elliott Group seem unlikely.



Vivian laughed. "Looks like we're not the only ones planning to challenge Millie and Elliott Group."



Johnny raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean?"


Vivian smirked. "Their official promo still isn't out. If it turns out weaker than this, they'll be completely overshadowed." She paused, and then added, "Let's stir things up a little."


Johnny returned her smile. "I'm in."







Online chatter picked up fast.



"Is Elliott Group really launching today? Why hasn't the promo dropped? Maybe they saw this brilliant video and gave up."



"Come on, what can Millie really bring to the table?She wasn't even a businesswoman."



"She might set the worst sales record in company history."


"That'd be a disaster. Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me."



Before long, the buzz took over the trending charts.Hashtags like #MermaidBlueSapphire,#ElliottGroupPromo and #MillieWorstSalesRecord started climbing. That morning, Millie arrived early at the event site.


She glanced at the ongoing online discussions and smiled faintly.


This time, she had worked closely with Elliott Group to lead with their new Blue series.



The serious covered a broad range. With sapphires featured as the centerpiece, the company had crafted a variety of products at different price points.



It was a fresh strategy.


Rather than rely on the usual promotions, Millie decided to build buzz online first.


In a market flooded with options, customers needed a reason to choose Elliott Group.



Millie knew it had to go beyond looks, price, or brand name.



She believed in another motivator-status.



For some, owning a hot-ticket item that others couldn't easily get brought immense satisfaction.


This time, the Blue series catered to that exact feeling. The products were mid-tier, but positioned as highly desirable.



The first step was to drive attention.



Rumors about Millie and Myron had drawn the public eye. But gossip alone wouldn't convince anyone to make a purchase.


The campaign needed a product-driven hook.


The short video became that anchor.


As she watched online interest grow, Millie turned to a staff member at the counter and said, "Let's move to the next stage."


Moments later, the store officially opened.


Several new counters were unveiled, all part of the launch. Millie had overseen every detail of the renovations herself.



Above the counters, a 3D display hovered. No glasses were needed to view it. Outside, reporters waited in droves. Everyone knew today was the day.



The moment the doors opened, they rushed inside.Microphones were pointed straight at Millie.


"Miss Bennett, how do you plan to stand out today?"


"You've had ages to prepare, but your promo stil isn't out. Are you terrified by the mermaid video?"


"Miss Bennett..."



Flashbulbs went off like fireworks. Many livestreamed the scene. The audience grew by the second.


Vivian was also watching.



She noticed how the conversation online kept turning against Millie.



But offline, Millie stood poised. She smiled calmly,unshaken.



Then she addressed the room. "When you're shopping, what matters most is the product itself." Some assumed she was admitting defeat, but she wasn't done. "Of course," she added, "a good story can give a gemstone even more appeal."


Her words stirred confusion. No one was sure what she meant.


Then a soft melody began to play.


A woman's voice floated through the air, gentle and dreamy, like waves washing ashore.


The large 3D screen above the counters came to life.


A lavish cocktail party appeared on screen.


At its center stood a woman wearing a striking blue sapphire necklace.


Glasses clinked around her. Then she bumped into a handsome man and he steadied her. As she looked up, she noticed his eyes were as mysteriously blue as her own necklace.



The final frame froze. The screen held on the sapphire necklace and the man's gaze.
###Chapter 192 The Eyes Of A Lover Are The Eighth Ocean

Since everything was being live-streamed, the moment the clip appeared, a wave of excitement swept through the crowd.


Anyone who still doubted the mermaid video was a marketing stunt for Elliott Group's new product had their doubts wiped away. The new naked-eye 3D video made that clear.



Johnny's team jumped into action.


"This promo is nice. But it still doesn't top the mermaid video," someone said.



"Yeah," another agreed. "That one was better."



"The mermaid clip told a love story. This one's just standard advertising."


Heads nodded all around. Reporters turned toward Millie. "Honestly, this video feels kind of plain. Have you seen the mermaid one going around online?"



"This clearly can't compete with the mermaid video.What's your plan to fix this?"


Before Millie could answer, a flashy red Mercedes screeched to a dramatic stop nearby.


All eyes turned.


From the driver's seat stepped out a man wearing a smug smile. It was Oakley Evans.



He walked straight toward Millie. The crowd parted for him, sensing something was about to go down.



Oakley sneered. "Millie. Or do you prefer Serena?"


Millie met him with a soft smile and a slight nod. "Mr.Evans."



His cold stare didn't budge. "You helping my hot-headed brother with Heavenly Melody gave me quite the headache."
Millie kept smiling. She said nothing.


Oakley stepped closer. "Now that Elliott Group is launching a new product, I'm curious. What trick will you pull next?"


Millie lowered her gaze for a moment. Then she looked up and said, "I promise it'll surprise you, Mr.Evans."



"Oh?" Oakley raised a brow and sized her up."doubt that."



"Believe it or not, that's up to you, Mr. Evans," Millie replied calmly.


She tilted her head slightly, and then looked him in the eye, her smile fading just a little. "So, Mr. Evans,did you come here to cause trouble?"


Oakley let out a laugh. "Exactly. You caught on quick."



His gaze turned sharp. "I want to see how you plan to sell those jewels when this promo video flops. I'll wait for you to come crawling, trashing Charles and begging me. Maybe then f'll be generous enough to help a little."


But Millie only smiled.


She looked dazzling under the camera's lens.


Without a word to Oakley, she signaled to her team.


The paused video resumed. The crowd turned back to the screen.



The party scene continued, and suddenly, the necklace snapped. The gemstone fell.


As it dropped, the music rose to a soft climax.



The necklace shed its outer layers, revealing a pure blue sapphire.


It sank into the sea, where a little mermaid caught it.She swished her tail, lifted the blue gem, broke the surface, and admired its glow. Then, she turned and saw the prince. The gem in her hand mirrored the deep blue of his eyes.


"Wait, these two scenes are connected?" someone shouted.



"They're both part of the Elliott Group campaign!"


"Did Millie plan all of this?!"


Reporters spun toward her.


Millie stood still, still smiling-her gaze locked on Oakley.


His expression soured. But he muttered, "Still not that impressive. Nothing special."


Millie dipped her head slightly.



Then she turned to the crowd and said, "Everyone,please follow me."


The crowd followed as she walked off, clearing the intersection.



They entered Elliott Group's property.


Across the road stood another Elliott Group store,also fitted with a large outdoor 3D screen.


Between the two stores was a short, dead-end road.
No cars passed through.


Just then, the screen on the other side lit up, syncing with the one they had just watched.


One side showed a modern party. The other, an underwater world. And the road in the middle-under special lighting-turned into an ocean.


"Wow!" gasped the reporters, cameras flashing nonstop.



Then, Millie gently shook the bell in her hand.A gemstone-shaped platform rose from the side, lit by soft beams of light.


Millie looked at the crowd. Holding a gemstone necklace, she walked toward the platform.


As she stood at the center, the lights focused on the jewel in her hand.



With the two screens glowing on either side,the road beneath her shimmered like the sea, She looked like she had stepped into a fairytale.
The necklace sparkled brightly, tying the entire scene together.


Reporters were stunned, broadcasting every second.


"I believe this will look even more magical at night,"Millie said softly.



"Every piece from our Blue series is specially designed to reflect light. The focused beams bring out its brilliance completely. Just like this one, other pieces will have a similar effect. We've arranged with the city to close this road for two hours every night.Everyone's welcome to come, take photos, and enjoy the view." Her smile was warm as she spoke.



With the live broadcast still rolling, Millie's words immediately spread fa and wide.


Two outdoor 3D screens. A glowing visual ocean scene street. A perfect photo spot. It was made for the camera-and people loved it.


Especially Millie's live demonstration-it was simply beautiful.
These were mid-range products.Not cheap,but still within reach for many.


And the story behind it was also beautiful.


Comments online began to explode. "Everything matches-the gem, the ocean, the prince's eyes.Someone said it best, 'The eyes of a lover are the eighth ocean.' That's what this feels like. So romantic!"



Then Millie spoke again. "Ladies and gentlemen, this is out new Blue series. It stands for serenity, passion,and romance. We invite you all to explore and make a purchase."



Right as she finished, Elliott Group's website released the collection online. Images. Descriptions.Orders began pouring in. People nearby rushed straight into the store.


Millie slowly turned back and looked at Oakley.He didn't look pleased.


Millie gave him a soft smile. "Mr. Evans, what do you think now? Did anything catch your eye?"
###Chapter 193 Her Heart Is Empty





Oakley let out a cold laugh before turning and walking away.



Millie stayed where she was, meeting the reporters'eyes with a calm, polite smile.



The crowd buzzed with conversation.



Not far off, Brandon sat in his car, staring at the storefront in silence.



His gaze was thoughtful and distant.


He remembered the early days of the Watson Group's transformation. Millie had stood beside him then, offering advice and pitching in wherever she could. But now, all her effort went toward someone else.



Brandon looked away, eyes dimming, and quietly told Eugene todrive.
Millie continued to answer the reporters' questions,unaware that a car had pulled up behind her. Inside sat Myron,silently watching her.


Though she had agreed to spend time with him recently, Myron never saw love in her eyes-only the friendly warmth and trust of a business partner or a friend.



She seemed to enjoy the surprises he gave her, but the spark in her expression never lasted. There was no sign of him in her heart.


Even though Brandon no longer held her affection,her heart was still empty. Myron couldn't help but wonder how he could truly earn a place in Millie's heart.



"It's too soon," Myron whispered. "I'll have to take it slow. Step by step. At least for now, her heart belongs to no one."



That was something. She had agreed to give it a chance-to get to know him.
His mind wandered to one distant day in the past at the port. Millie had carefully chosen spices while the salesperson patiently introduced each one to her.


She had smiled so warmly and said, "My boyfriend has trouble sleeping. I want something to help him rest better."


He could still see her eyes then-bright and full of love.


Then came the snowy night. She had run into another man's arms without hesitation.


"Don't worry, Brandon, you still have me," she had said. "I'll stay by your side, even if the whole world turns against you."


At that time, Myron himself had just been betrayed by someone he trusted. He had barely escaped with his life.


Only those who've been betrayed know what truly matters.



Myron closed his eyes, hiding the shadows in his expression.


When he opened them again, his face had returned to its usual calm and graceful look.


Millie noticed him approaching and gave a faint smile.


"Myron," she greeted him. It still felt unfamiliar on her tongue, but she knew one day it wouldn't.







The Elliott Group's new Blue series was an undeniable success.



Thanks to strong marketing and Oakley's failed attempts to stir trouble, the launch attracted massive attention and plenty of interested buyers.


Millie's clever promotional strategies had already pulled in a wave of orders. Many customers were planning to return that evening when the store's lighting would be at its best.


The store was also packed. A large promotional poster of Millie hung nearby.


She wore a vivid blue dress, a dazzling gemstone necklace, and matching sapphire earrings. Her hair flowed freely around her shoulders.


The setup didn't perfectly match the promo video,but the sapphire around her neck clearly resembled the Heart of the Ocean.



The campaign also featured a song called Blue,written and composed by Eva, and performed by Millie as the brand ambassador.However, the single was released under Eva's name. Millie's voice sounded like Eva's, but distinct.


Online chatter speculated Eva had started imitating Millie's singing style.


Previously, when Vivian released her revamped Glimmer of Love, Eva had been accused of seizing her moment.


But no one could deny the success of the Blue series.

Eva's single had also taken off, quickly climbing into the top ten on the new songs chart.


By evening, a new entertainment poll popped up online.



The question was simple-Millie or Vivian?


Each person could vote once per day.


There were no prizes, but that didn't stop the public from jumping in.


Thanks to the success of the Blue launch event,Millie's votes surged, leaving Vivian far behind.


Vivian was livid.


"All this over some mid-range gemstone products?"she fumed inside her studio. "Even if she gets a cut from her contract, how much could it be? Does she really think she can surpass me?"


She paced the floor in frustration.


"And Eva-she's refused me but then joined forces with Millie!"

Her caregiver, sensing trouble, spoke up hesitantly."Eva's signed with Evans Entertainment. Isn't it normal for her to collaborate with Millie?"



Vivian shot her a glare.


The caregiver went quiet. Vivian's expression turned calculating and cold.


Since Eva and Millie were working together,they were now tied to the same fate.



It was sometimes hard to target one person. But with two, there were more opportunities.


She could now easily use Eva's scandals to get to Millie.



Vivian had long suspected Eva was holding out for a better offer.


Vivian had noticed the way Eva watched Charles while still entertaining her team. Eva was probably waiting for Charles to make the next move back then.


Maybe the collaboration with Millie had come as a perk from Charles' side.


The idea settled her nerves.



"Today's success wasn't even yours, Millie," she muttered. "Myron handed it to you. Don't think you can outshine me."







In a private dining room, glasses clinked together.


"Cheers!"



Another celebration was underway.


This time, all the Elliott siblings were present.


Ari had passed her hospital checkup and could be discharged,though she still needed care.


Everyone had shown up.


"I knew you could pull it off, Millie!" Alexia beamed."You have no idea-so many of our coworkers were saying today they wanted to buy what you were endorsing."
Giffard took a long drink and nodded. "Same in my department. The guys are talking about buying them for their girlfriends."



Laughter rippled around the room.


No one seemed happier than Charles. He stood in the middle of the room, laughing heartily with his hands on his hips.


"Honestly, I think Oakley's lost his mind," he said."He tried to sabotage Millie. Look how that turned out. Totally blew up in his face."


He turned to Millie, grinning. "When he came crawling back, I gave him a real roasting. Grandpa even chewed him out for embarrassing himself!"


"He deserved it," Jayceon added, and everyone burst out laughing.
###Chapter 194 | Want You To Love Me
Millie was the star of the evening.


She took a long sip of wine, her heart light with satisfaction.



She mingled and chatted, keeping the atmosphere warm and lively.


The launch had gone well. It wasn't a final victory, not yet, but it was a strong beginning. That was enough to ease her mind for now.



After dancing with Charles and Alexia, she made her way back to Ari.


Nearby, Myron kept his eyes glued to Millie the entire time, occasionally glancing over to check on the little girl.


Ari, content in her seat, nibbled on snacks and chatted with Myron. "Myron," she said, "I'm just like other kids now. Can I come visit your house more?want to see your cat." She looked at him with wide,hopeful eyes.


"Last time, Jayceon showed me a video of Kiki learning something new," she added. "But I didn't get to watch it."



Myron smiled and gently wiped crumbs from her mouth. "Of course," he said warmly. "If Millie says yes, I'll take you to see Kiki."


Ari turned to Millie with an eager look.


Ari was slowly treating Millie like family.


Millie felt a rush of warmth.



She reached out and gave Ari's cheek a gentle pinch."Of course you can, she said. "If you want to see Kiki, just say so. Ari, we're family. You don't need to be polite."



Myron nodded. "I feel the same way."


Ari's eyes lit up. She looked between them, and then broke into a bright smile.


"Okay!" she chirped.







Laughter filled the room. But elsewhere, the mood was different. Brandon and Vivian had just finished dinner.He was now driving her home.


The silence between them was awkward.



When they reached her apartment, the car stopped.

But Vivian didn't move.



"Brandon," she said suddenly.


He turned his eyes slightly, waiting.


"I heard from Eugene," she said. "Watson Group has officially cut ties with me."


"Yes," Brandon replied, eyes drifting to the window.


Silence fell again.


Vivian looked at him. "So that's it?" she asked."You're just going to leave me like this?"
Brandon didn't answer right away. He reached for a folder and handed it to her.


Vivian hesitated but then took it.


He spoke calmly. "That film project carries too much risk. Watson Group can't afford it. Eugene found this instead. It's a better fit for you-and it works with your studio."



Vivian glanced at the file. Then she tossed it aside.



"I don't want it," she said flatly.



Brandon felt a headache building.



He couldn't understand why Vivian was so attached to that project.



It was reckless but she seemed to be obsessed with it.



But he didn't need to understand-he just needed to get things done.



"Choose one," Brandon said. Vivian's expression darkened.



She stared at him.



"Don't you care about us?" she snapped. "Everything I'm doing is for us, and our wedding."


Brandon didn't respond. He kept his eyes forward.


Vivian's voice trembled. "Are you disappointed in me because of Millie's success today?" she asked. "But you know Myron's helping her."


Brandon's lips tightened.


Vivian's eyes filled with tears. "She's with someone else now," she said. "But you still care more about her than me?"



Her voice cracked. "I know l act on impulse, but l really don't have much time left. I just want to marry you."



Tears rolled down her face.



Brandon looked at her for a long moment. Then he reached out and gently wiped her cheeks. "There's no need to cry," he said.


Vivian clutched his hand.



"I've divorced her," Brandon said.


"You love me, don't you?" she asked.


Brandon didn't answer. His lips pressed into a tight line.



He looked at Vivian, but saw Millie's face instead.


He remembered her laughing with Myron. The image made something twist inside him. Jealousy hit him before he could stop it.


And when he realized it, he felt like he was losing his mind.







The celebration had come to an end.


Myron was driving Millie and Ari home.


Ari gave them both a hug before heading inside the children's home. Millie watched her go, her heart stirred with the urge to finalize the adoption as soon as possible so she could be with Ari every single day. But she also knew she had to be patient.



"It's alright," Myron said gently, noticing her expression. "I've arranged for medical staff on standby. There's nothing to worry about."



Millie nodded.



She understood. But maybe the wine had made her a little emotional.


The driver waited nearby, but Myron, sensing her mood, suggested, "Let's walk for a bit."


Millie nodded."Alright."


She needed the air.


Under the soft streetlights, the trees cast long shadows across the sidewalk.



The two walked quietly. Myron stayed close, silently keeping pace beside her. After a while, he motioned for her to stop.


"Your shoelace is untied," he said. Then he crouched down.



Millie tried to stop him, but he was alreadly reaching for the laces.



She watched as he tied her shoe, head bowed in concentration.



There was always something calm and steady about him. He gave the sense that nothing could shake him.



Ari liked him too.


The streetlight washed everything in warm gold.


Millie knew he would be good to Ari.


"All done," he said, wiping his hands with a handkerchief before looking up.



He stayed in a half-kneeling position, meeting her eyes from below.
He then frowned slightly.


"Millie," he said.



"Yes?"


"I want you to accept me for who l am. Not because of Ari."



Her eyes lowered. He had read her thoughts again.


He reached up and gently touched her face, lifting her gaze to his.


Still kneeling,he held her eyes.


"I want you to love me. I want you to accept me. Not because of Ari. Not because of a deal. Not because of anything else."



His eyes were steady and sincere.


"In your heart," he said, "I want there to be room for me.For Myron Elliott."


A breeze moved softly through the trees. Millie looked down at him, the man still kneeling before her. In that quiet moment, her heart stirred like a leaf caught in the wind.

###Chapter 195 A Genuine Affection





Myron looked at Millie, and in that quiet moment,it felt as though everything else had faded away,and it was just the two of them left in the world.


The soft breeze blew strands of her hair, and the warmth from his hand ran through her, stirring a feeling she couldn't quite name.


Then,he smiled.


The smile lit up his face and he looked genuinely happy.


He stayed on one knee, looking up at her with eyes that held nothing but affection.


At last, he saw it. After all this time, he caught a glimpse of affection in her eyes.


It wasn't mere gratitude, compatibility, or friendship.


It was real affection towards him. It passed quickly, but that fleeting moment alone made him very happy.


If love meant lowvering himself completely, then he would gladly stay at her feet, just for the chance to be close to her heart.


Millie caught sight of Myron's smile.


It was the first time in days she had seen him shine with such warmth.



His usual calm and polished air was gone, and his eyes was now filled with raw, intense emotion.


There was nothing restrained about it. For the first time, she saw a firm, possessive look in his gaze.


It made her feel inexplicably shy.


Her eyes dropped, and she turned her head, unable to hold his gaze.


Myron rose to his feet and stood beside her.


He towered over her small frame, so he could easily wrap her in his arms. He stared down at her, taking her in. The wind tousled her hair, and her lashes dipped when she dropped her head.


He felt a sudden urge to pull her into his arms, but he held back.


He then said, "The weather is nice tonight, and the breeze feels good. Want to keep walking for a bit?"



Millie nodded.



Then he reach out, offering his open palm to her. His hand was large and the lines across it were etched clearly.



Her lips parted slightly as she hesitated for a moment, but then slowly placed her hand into his.


He wrapped his fingers around hers firmly, his eyes crinkling with a smile.



Millie kept her head down, too shy to look up at him.


They walked hand in hand for a while, and passed by a small food stall. The stall was run by a couple, both occupied with work, while a child slept inside a nearby tent.


Even with the couple moving busily around the stall,the child remained fast asleep, undisturbed by the noise.



Millie glanced over, and Myron turned to her with a suggestion. "Want to get some snacks?"


"Yes, sounds good," Millie responded. The drinks from earlier, combined with their walk, had left her a little hungry.


They bought some chicken and fries from the couple and found a stone block nearby to sit on. They then wore disposable gloves and startedeating.


Seeing Myron like this made Millie burst into laughter.


He looked over at her with cheeks puffed out with food,wondering what she found so funny.


Millie took a good look at him.



From his luxury watch and custom suit to the shimmering cufflinks on his sleeves, everything about Myron screamed elegance. Yet now, he sat beside her on a stone block, casually munching on fried chicken.



"It's nothing," she said, smiling. "You just feel a lot more down-to-earth right now, not so much like the untouchable CEO you usually seem to be."


He no longer came across as the unreachable CEO of a gemstone empire. Sitting beside her like this, he felt more like someone she could truly know.


That invisible wall between them seemed to shrink.


After swallowing his bite, Myron said, "Back when I spent time at sea for work, there were times we barely had enough to eat. I had to make do with whatever we had."



He went on, "Most of the food on the ship were bland, canned meals. So whenever we docked,we'd rush out to find something decent to eat. Street food always tasted incredible in those moments." He spoke,reaching for a napkin to wipe sauce off her lips. "Still, nothing beats the variety of dishes from home."



Then, his expression changed. His face tensed for a second, and his lips twitched slightly, as though he recalled an unpleasant memory.


"What's wrong?" Millie asked softly, taking the napkin from his hand to wipe her mouth, confused by his change in demeanor.



"Just thought of some truly terrible cooking attempts by two certain people..." Myron said, clearly referring to Jayceon's and Adriana's infamous kitchen disasters.



Millie caught on right away and gave a knowing nod.


She remembered Jayceon's confident attempt at cooking when she last visited the Elliott Mansion. He had insisted on preparing his signature dish, only to end up burning something as basic as scrambled eggs.


As they continued eating, their conversation moved to lighter topics. The night breeze brushed past them gently, and both of them looked completely at ease in each other's company.


Nearby, the couple who owned the stall finally wrapped up for the night and walked over to check on their sleeping child, speaking to each other in hushed tones.



Neither Millie nor Myron noticed the black Rolls-Royce parked around the corner.



Inside, Egbert sat looking through a set of photos he had just taken, letting out a resigned sigh.



He had originally planned to get some praise from Millie once she sent Ari back, especially after setting up a poll that could sway opinion and bring attention to the Blue series.



But while waiting near the children's home, he hadn't expected to see what he did. Myron crouched down and was tying Millie's shoelaces. Now, they were sharing late-night snacks together.
"They really do look like they belong together.."Egbert muttered with a sigh. I thought I was fast enough, but Myron you crafty fox.. You beat me to it."



He flipped through the photos again, watching the scene play out frame by frame. The two had just finished eating and were now getting up to toss their trash.



"I can't bear this frustration alone," Egbert grumbled.He scrolled through his contacts, found the one he had in mind, and sent over the pictures.







Meanwhile,Brandon had returned to his apartment.


He lay sprawled on the couch, eyes fixed on the pale ceiling above him.


For days, the same question had been circling his thoughts. The one he asked Rita, hoping she could offer him some advice.



If all he was capable of was bringing pain to Millie, would it be better to just let her go?


His phone vibrated twice


Brandon reached for it and saw a message from Egbert.


"I can't be the only one seeing this. Take a look," the message read.


Attached were several photos of Millie and Myron together.



In each one, she wore a radiant smile.


Brandon brushed his fingers over her smiling face with an aching heart.


He couldn't bring himself to let her go.


She was supposed to be his.


Watching her smile like that at someone else simply felt unbearable.







Meanwhile, Myron had already seen Millie home  safely





This time, he made sure to walk her all the way to her floor, not wanting a repeat of the uninvited encounter with Brandon from before.


Just as she was about to step through her door,Myron called out softly, "Millie."


She paused and turned to him. "Yes?"



"I'd like to move up the date of our third meeting.Would that be alright?" he asked with a smile.



Millie nodded. "That's fine."



"Great. I'll send you the details soon," he said.


"Okay," Millie replied.


Then, Myron reached out. He hesitated for a moment, but went ahead and touched her cheek."Goodnight."


Looking into the depth of his eyes, Millie whispered,"Goodnight."
Millie went inside, and Myron turned to the elevator and left the building, only to find Brandon standing close by, watching.
###Chapter 196 The Only One He Wanted





This was the first time Myron and Brandon had met alone since their last heated argument, and Brandon seemed calmer now.



They stood at a distance, studying each other in silence, Then Myron offered a faint smile and asked,"Care fora drink?"



In a private room at Blue Lounge, Myron held his glass and watched Brandon, who had already emptied one and sat with his head bowed.



Neither of them spoke.


Myron was waiting. He wanted Brandon to be the one to speak first.



Brandon poured another drink. Just before he finished it, he asked, "Why did you do it? "What do you mean?" Myron replied.


"Millie." Brandon said her name clearly, his eyes fixed on Myron.


"| thought I made it clear last time. I like her. I'm pursuing her," Myron replied.


Brandon's brow tightened as he stared at Myron,not with anger this time, but with intent. He looked like a man trying to peel back layers, searching for what lay beneath.



"Myron," he said, "from what I know of you, you wouldn't like someone like her."



Myron let out a quiet laugh. "There's a lot you don't know about me."



Brandon's tone turned sharp. "So you spent years exiled at sea and only now decided you like her?"


Myron lowered his gaze.


Those years had indeed been exile imposed by his family,though few knew the truth. His branch had not held power then. Someone else in the Elliott family had.


Myron had been forced to survive on his own,building shipping routes and amassing resources.Shipping had become the core of his empire.


He had formed an intricate web-routes, ports, trade partners, all tightly bound.


The gem business was only one part of it.


He dealt in far more. If it moved through customs,he took a cut.



But few people understood just how much he really controlled.



Even Brandon only knew Myron had been exiled by his family, not the extent of what followed.


Those years taught Myron brutal lessons. He faced betrayal, loss, and the painful cost of trust. He once believed loyalty didn't exist.


Until he met Millie. He had seen her love someone else with everything she had. He watched her throw herself into that love,again and again, without hesitation.


At first, he only observed. Then came envy. And eventually, jealousy. Night after night, it grew stronger.


In time, he realized he wanted her. Not to admire from afar-but to have her.



Even while she loved someone else, he had already fallen.



"What's wrong? Hard to answer?" Brandon asked,pulling him back to the present.



"You know as much as I do that human nature is complicated to begin with, Brandon," Myron said."There's no need to ask such childish things. But if you want a clear answer, here it is. I do like Millie.I've never lied to you about that."


He set his glass down and looked at Brandon, who seemed unable to hide the bitterness on his face. "Haven't you already chosen Vivian?" Myron asked."While you kept turning your back on Millie, do you know how many times she cried for you?"


Brandon stared at him in silence.



"If your decision is made, then don't look back,"Myron said. "Let her go. Stop hurting her."


"| can't." Brandon's eyes turned red. "I can't live without her."


Myron frowned and stayed quiet.


"You could have anyone," Brandon said, his voice low. "Why does it have to be her? She's not the only one-"



"How do you know that?" Myron interrupted, cutting him off.


Brandon fell silent, stunned by the intensity in Myron's eyes.


In that moment, he understood something clearly for the first time.
Myron was serious. He wasn't playing a game. He truly/ wanted Millie. And only her.






The night was cool. Millie lay alone in the bathtub,surrounded by warmth.


Steam rose around her, softening the edges of the room.


She stared at the water, her thoughts drifting through everything that had happened-recent events, old memories.



She was only twenty-five, but life had already spun her through one storm after another.


Her marriage to Brandon was beyond repair.


She didn't want to dwell on the past. She wanted to keep moving forward.


She thought of Myron, and the look in his eyes.Warm.Steady.Full of affection.


She dropped her gaze and stared at her reflection in the water.



For a moment, she had felt it too. That subtle,fluttering feeling.


Maybe it was the heat. Maybe it was something more. Her heart began to race.


Should she accept him? Should she allow herself to return those feelings?


Her thoughts grew hazy.







BackK at Blue Lounge, Myron had already left.


Brandon stayed behind, drinking one glass after another.



A dull ache pressed against his chest.


He couldn't breathe. So he drank. Only that gave him a brief escape. A fleeting numbness.


But the more he drank, the more Millie's face came into focus. Myron wanted her.


Egbert was also watching for a chance.


Charles and Giffard,too.


The bitterness inside Brandon deepened.


He couldn't let go. In his mind, Millie could only ever belong to him.






That night, Myron sat in the back of the Bentley,heading home.


He looked out the window, taking in the quiet scenery.


The weather was good. His mood was pleasant.


He thought about the look Millie had given him earlier. The hint of warmth in her eyes. He smiled, his heart feeling lighter.


The car passed through the gates of Elliott Mansion.


Jayceon was in the living room, playing with Kiki. He greeted Myron as he stepped into the house.


Myron returned the greeting, and then walked straight to his study.


He laid out a sheet of paper and picked up a charcoal pencil.


Stroke by stroke, he drew the image that had stayed in his mind all evening-Millie's eyes, filled with feeling.


He looked at the finished sketch. His eyes softened.


After a while, he placed the drawing in a frame and moved to another room.


He opened the door. The lights came on, revealing rows of shelves that lined the walls.


He walked slowly toward an empty one, the new painting in hs hands.


In the corner of the paper, he wrote the date. Then he set it on the stand.



Next to it hung another drawing-MAillie crouched down, feeding Kiki with treats.


He stood still, letting his gaze drift across the room.Every shelf. Every frame. Every image. All of them were of the same person.



Millie.
###Chapter 197 If Genuine Love Exists Within Your Heart For Me
Myron swept his gaze across the room one final time before extinguishing the lights and drawing the door closed behind him.



He descended the staircase with deliberate steps,each footfall echoing softly in the quiet house; then he settled into his chair in the living room to observe Jayceon's patient training session with Kiki, their plump ragdoll cat.


The fluffy feline was mastering the art of interactive play under Jayceon's watchful guidance.


"Keep those claws tucked away," Jayceon coached the feline with endless patience. "Do you understand me?"



"Meow~" Kiki responded with perfect obedience,settling into a poised sitting position.

The moment Myron appeared downstairs, Jayceon rose immediately from his crouched position,scooping Kiki into his arms with practiced ease.


"Myron," he began, cradling the cat against his chest, "I've secured a place of my own and I'm planning to relocate soon. When do you think you'll be ready to bring Ari and Millie here to stay?"


While Adriana had her own place, Jayceon had shared this mansion with Myron for years, a natural arrangement since he held the position of the youngest in their close-knit family.


Myron's fingers found the sweet spot beneath Kiki's chin, scratching gently as he considered his response. "That might require more time than we'd hoped.Millie still needs more preparation."


Jayceon acknowledged this with a slow nod, though confusion flickered across his features.



"And how are matters progressing between you and Miss McCoy?" Myron inquired with studied casualness. Jayceon's head shook with immediate, almost frantic denial.


"Nothing exists between us-those are merely baseless rumors circulating without foundation," he muttered, his words tumbling together in embarrassment.



Myron regarded him with a penetrating stare, allowed a knowing smile to curve his lips, and then chose to leave the subject unexplored.







Meanwhile, across the city in the hotel's elegant lobby, Egbert had barely crossed the threshold when the desk clerk approached with professional courtesy. "Mr. Perez, you have someone waiting for your return upstairs."


Egbert found this development peculiar. He wasn't expecting anyone-who could possibly be seeking his company?


He acknowledged the information with a thoughtful nod and made his way to the elevator, his mind turning over possibilities.



Upon reaching his suite's entrance, the mystery resolved itself-Babette stood waiting in the hallway.


Without making any move to unlock his door, Egbert addressed her directly, "What pressing circumstances bring you to my doorstep at this hour?"



Babette rose gracefully from her waiting position-today she had chosen her attire with particular care and strategic attention to detail.


She cradled an ornate decorative box in her manicured hands, lifting the lid to reveal an elegant bottle of deep red wine nestled within silk padding.



" wanted to present you with this gift," Babette explained, her voice carrying rehearsed warmth."This vintage comes from my famly's private vineyard, and it holds special meaning for me. l hoped you might also appreciate its flavor."
examined the wine with measured interest before accepting it from her outstretched hands.


"Very well, I'll receive your offering," he stated with formal politeness. "My gratitude for y/our thoughtfulness-you may depart now."



He pivoted toward his door with decisive movement,key already positioned in his palm, preparing to disappear inside.



"Egbert." Babette's voice rang out with desperate urgency, stepping directly into his path to block his retreat.



"Is there something additional you need to discuss?"Egbert asked, his brow creasing with slight annoyance as he regarded her persistence.


"Are you still mad at me?" Babette pressed, her words rushing together. "Because I took the wine with me and later show her?"



Egbert offered no verbal response, simply allowing his gaze to settle upon her upturned face.
"Egbert, she's already experienced both marriage and divorce," Babette declared with pointed emphasis.


Egbert had no desire to continue this conversation,turning once again toward his sanctuary.


"Even though she's separated herself from Brandon now, she's already begun pursuing a new romantic connection. You cannot possess her heart!" Babette declared, her determination overriding her dignity."Egbert, every effort you're making amounts to wasted energy."


Babette positioned herself directly in Egbert's path,craning her neck upward to meet his towering gaze.


"Why can't your eyes truly see me?" Her eyes brimmed with unshed tears. "Everything she's capable of offering you, I can provide as well-and more."



Egbert released a deep, weary sigh, and then extended the wine bottle back toward Babette's trembling hands.
"You should probably take this back and leave," he stated with finality, unlocking his door and stepping across the threshold, already moving to shut her out.But Babette pressed her full weight against the door's surface, preventing its closure.


"Why did you choose to rescue me that day?" she cried out, her voice breaking with raw emotion."Wouldn't everything have been simpler if you had simply allowed death to claim me?"


Egbert applied firm pressure, forcing her back into the hallway, and then secured the door between them with finality.


His mind drifted back to that fateful night, and the truth settled heavily in his chest. The entire rescue had been built on a fundamental misunderstanding.


He had believed the Watson Group's contact person was Millie, so when he learned the woman connected to that deal faced mortal danger, he had personally intervened without hesitation-only that woman turned out to be Babette.
But Babette deserved no explanation for his actions -the truth would only complicate matters further.







As night descended over the city, casting long shadows across the streets, Elliott Group's Blue series campaign ignited a photography craze among the general public.



Crowds swarmed enthusiastically in the space between the two massive advertising screens,everyone eager to capture the perfect shot.


Fortunately, that particular section terminated in a dead end, with virtually no vehicle traffic on the opposite side, and the city had implemented a partial road closure lasting two precious hours each evening to accommodate the surge of visitors.


The ownership details carried little significance since the Elliott Group held title to the entire district surrounding the installation.


Those who had invested in the Blue series and captured photographs alongside their purchases discovered the most breathtaking results-the evening illumination reflecting off the precious gemstones cast an ethereal blue radiance,transforming each person into a figure suspended within a temporal rift between dimensions.


The vast "ocean" stretching endlessly before them and the towering 3D screens flanking either side enhanced the otherworldly sensation of standing balanced between parallel universes.


Even individuals who had bypassed purchasing from the Blue series experienced some measure of the enchanting effect, though their photos lacked the same dramatic intensity.


Social media platforms became saturated with countless videos and images flooding every feed,igniting passionate discussions that spread like wildfire across the digital landscape.


"I heard this entire concept originated from Millie's creative vision-she architected every single detail of this masterpiece!"
"This represents pure genius in action! It easily surpasses those tediously monotonous activities that plagued each Christmas brand event by astronomical measures!"



"Absolutely agreed, and that accompanying song delivers incredible impact too. I'd wager my savings that Millie wielded significant influence in its creation!"



"When discussing Eva's involvement, I must confess I've always perceived her as the undisputed champion of claiming abandoned opportunities. The identical pattern emerged during the entire Vivian situation previously."


"Vivian bears no fault in this matter. Her heart simply yearned for the sacred ceremony of marriage."


Amid the escalating debates and heated exchanges,an unexpected hashtag materialized with sudden force-#VivianLuxuryVillaFloralSeries.


Millie and Vivian had occupied the epicenter of public conversation for weeks, and Vivian's breaking news swiftly claimed the coveted top position on trending lists.



Social media users buzzed with anticipation and speculation.


At precisely this moment, Millie had just emerged from her refreshing shower, droplets still clinging to her skin.



She glanced at the unfolding news coverage and allowed a cold, knowing smirk to curve across her lips.


Vivian had indeed executed her carefully planned maneuver with precision timing.


As Millie contemplated the implications, another trending hashtag burst into prominence-#VivianLiveBroadcast.


The streaming backdrop displayed stark, clinical whiteness, and Vivian appeared ghostly pale against its harsh contrast.



She manufactured a smile for the camera, though the expression seemed strained and artificial. "My assistant informed me that countless supporters have expressed genuine concern about my well-being, so l decided to initiate this live streaming session." Vivian then coughed, her appearance radiating unmistakable illness, her eyes transformed into bloodshot pools from the relentless coughing spasms.



She managed a weak smile despite her obvious discomfort. "You represent my most loyal supporters, functioning almost like business partners in this journey. Today, as I witness everyone's fascination with my ongoing competition against Millie, I feel compelled to provide you with a comprehensive update on my recent developments.First, 'Love of Vivian' currently navigates the complex process of securing theatrical distribution rights, and considerable time may pass before audiences can experience it in cinema venues. Second, I've rekindled memories of how your awareness of my work initially blossomed-through my signature luxury villa floral series. I pledge to resurrect this beloved project, and this time, it shall continue flourishing until my final breath leaves my body.Finally, some among you may have discovered that Watson Group has completely severed all operational ties with 'Love of Vivian, a development that has prompted extensive self-reflection on my part. I will not possess Watson Group's formidable support during this crucial battle, but my conscience remains completely unburdened."



She seemed to drift into painful memories, her expression shifting toward profound melancholy."Perhaps my desires grew too ambitious, nurturing hopes for a beautiful wedding ceremony... But such disappointments are manageable. Millie and | will each demonstrate our individual talents without external assistance."



She brightened with renewed determination. "Finally,I hope each of you will champion my luxury villa floral series project with your unwavering support."


After delivering her carefully crafted message, Vivian claimed exhaustion had  overtaken her and disconnected from the broadcast.



As Vivian monitored the hashtag's popularity ascending to extraordinary heights, deep satisfaction flooded her calculating eyes.


Earlier that day, Brandon had presented her with two distinct options for moving forward.


She had rejected both alternatives but countered with her own demand instead. "Brandon, you needn't concern yourself with 'Love of Vivian's' fate. That project has already separated from the Watson Group completely and I'll take care of everything from here, but you absolutely must assist me with my luxury villa floral series initiative. Brandon,your heart desires my victory, doesn't it? If you truly want me to triumph, if genuine love exists within your heart for me, then grant me this solemn promise."


During that tense conversation, Brandon had offered no verbal response, merely directing her to establish contact with Eugene.


Vivian's smile widened with triumphant knowledge that Brandon remained firmly positioned on her síde,his resolve too weak to deny her compelling requests.
###Chapter 198 Do You Really Think You Can Ever Fix Things
Vivian hesitated for only a beat, and then quickly fired off a message to Johnny.


The moment he saw it, Johnny leapt into action,spinning the story in every direction at once.


He pointed out that while Vivian never received a scrap of help from the Watson Group, while Millie took the Elliott Group's backing without a second thought. Was that really fair? Everyone knew Myron had been circling Millie for weeks now.


He also emphasized that all Vivian wanted was a simple wedding.


And finally, Johnny rallied support for Vivian's luxury villa floral series project, urging everyone to check out her newest line.



With this fresh narrative, public opinion flipped on its head.



Sympathy for Vivian flooded in, and before long, the top comment read, "Millie only gets her moment in the spotlight thanks to Elliott Group's endorsement.Vivian has made everything herself. Whether it's Love of Vivian or her new project, these are Vivian's own creations. What does Millie even have that compares?"



The Internet exploded into a frenzy.


Millie saw Vivian's tactics unfold with a relaxed,almost amused smile.



She had known Vivian would never let herself be sidelined.



Seville quickly rallied the group, setting the conversation in motion.



After a brief pause, Millie sent her message. "Our priority is to protect consumers. Buyingis a personal choice-no one should be made to feel guilty about not buying anything."
Seville wasted no time, pushing those points hard.


First, Millie's collaboration with the Elliott Group was earned fair and square-her win at Heavenly Melody was public information, her hard work visible to all.Every design in the collection and the display had taken real effort; no one could say she hadn't earned her success. Second, people bought what they liked.No one deserved criticism for making their own decisions.


The Elliott Group released a statement soon after,making it clear they stood firmly behind their customers.



With so many people already having purchased items from the Blue series, the brand's open support put buyers at ease.


Some buyers found themselves suddenly labeled as Millie's fans and being harassed by haters because of it, which was really annoying.


"Calling me a fan just because I bought something she endorses? That's absurd. I picked it up because the design was beautiful and I really liked it. I don't even know who Millie or Vivian is!"



"If Vivian wants a wedding, why can't they just get married and get it over with? If her family's against it,they can always tie the knot overseas."



Most poeople didn't bother getting involved, choosing to ignore the latest wave of online drama.


Eventually, Derek stepped forward to address the mesS.



He posted a video statement. "What I'm offering here is crucial to both parties. The stakes are massive. If it weren't absolutely necessary, neither Millie nor Vivian would ever agree to this competition.This is about skill-plain and simple."


He also revealed part of Millie's contract, making it clear she'd have to pay three times the price to buy back what she wanted if she lost.



While Derek never revealed the complete contract, it was obvious to everyone that anything entered into a match like this had to be priceless.


After Derek's intervention, the online furor began to cool.



Midnight came and went, ushering in the next round of voting.


As soon as the polls opened, the numbers skyrocketed.


Unlike yesterday's landslide in Millie's favor, this time her votes and Vivian's raced forward side by side-locked in a dead heat.



Millie took in the scene, her expression unreadable.


Vivian was far from an easy opponent.


Vivian might be pouring her energy into the "Love of Vivian" project, but everyone knew the real foundation of her reputation was that high-end villa floral design series-the one that had catapulted both her and her brand into the spotlight.


But beneath the shine, Millie understood the truth- this luxury line wasn't a gold mine.


The potential for profit was limited. After all, only those who actually owned luxury villas could even consider paying for these extravagant designs.


It was no secret that Vivian's business had surged years ago thanks to Brandon's connections.


But most affluent clients preferred to keep their personal lives private from the public, and that included the interiors their houses. No one wanted their opulent decor paraded in the media.


And now, with the future uncertain, Millie wondered how long Vivian could keep finding more clients for her signature work. Would Brandon keep opening doors for her, or would that support dryup?


She pushed those thoughts aside. Whatever deals Vivian struck behind closed doors were none of Millie's business.


All that mattered was winning, one round at a time.


Millie lingered in her thoughts until her phone buzzed  You Can Eve against the table.


She glanced down, thumbed it open, and saw Myron's name flash across the screen. "Don't be mad.Check this out."



Beneath his message was a short video.


In it, Myron's plump ragdoll cat sprawled belly-up on the sofa, all four paws sticking straight in the air-each one balancing a bright yellow rubber duck.


The cat lay so still, Millie almost mistook it for a plush toy, if not for the subtle twitch of its fluffy tail.


Off to the side, Myron lounged in soft pajamas,quietly squeezing a rubber duck until it gave a squeak.


The cat hissed indignantly, tail swishing in protest.


Millie let out a quiet laugh, the corners of her mouth curving up at the sight of it.


What a smart and charming little cat!


After a moment's thought, she remarked, "Ari would definitely love this."


Then, after a beat, she added, "Honestly, i kind of love it too."



Glancing back at the video, she couldn't help lingering on the image of Myron-so casual in soft loungewear, a world away from his crisp, businesslike self. The gentle, domestic side of him gave her a warmth she hadn't expected.


Her phone buzzed again.


Myron's message popped up. "I love it too."


Something about his words made her pause, as if there was more beneath the surface-a note she couldn't quite name.


She let the feeling wash over her, and then set her phone aside and slipped quietly into bed, a small smile lingering on her lips.


Millie's irritation over Vivian's latest antics had faded replaced by a rare sense of calm. She even found herself in the mood to spend time with Myron's cat.
Not long after, she drifted into a deep, dreamless sleep.



Meanwhile, Brandon sat in a shadowed corner of Blue Lounge, eyes glued to his phone.


Beside him, Darden sipped a drink, still scrolling through the replay of Vivian's live stream.


"So this is why you asked me to lend Vivian my villa?Was that for her project?" Darden finally broke the silence, his tone heavy with unspoken judgment.



Brandon gave a silent nod.


Darden exhaled, setting his glass down with a dull thud.



"The more you back Vivian now, the more impossible it's going to be for you and Millie to patch things up later. You really think this is the right move?"


Brandon didn't answer right away. He stared into his drink, Myron's words from the previous night stil ringing in his ears.

 He drained his glass in one determined swallow.



"Vivian's getting reckless," he admitted, his eyes flickering toward the glow of the ceiling light. "But l don't have a choice. I have to help her. Letting Millie win just isn't an option."


If Millie walked away victorious, Derek would hand her the Bennett family inheritance.


And if that happened, Brandon knew he'd lose the only leverage he had left. She'd leave-without even letting him say what he needed to say.


"But if you keep this up... do you really think you and Millie can ever fix things?" Darden's words struck right at the center of his tangled thoughts.


Brandon stayed silent, staring through the rainbow-hued lights overhead, feeling nothing but a heavy grayness inside his chest.


He couldn't answer. All he could do was cling,stubbornly, to the one thing he still believed was right.
###Chapter 199 Surprise From Myron





Time seemed to slip away without notice.



It was time for Millie and Myron's third date.


This time, they met on a small island just fifteen minutes from Crobert.



The island often hosted public events.



In recent days, there had been a steady stream of activity, sparking curiosity about what was taking place there.



Even Millie had heard the rumors.



But when Myron picked her up, she finally understood. Everything happening on the island had been planned for her.


As they boarded the boat, she glanced at him and asked, "Isn't this a bit extravagant?"
He smiled. "It's not just the two of us."



That only deepened her curiosity.


They set off at dusk. The sun hung low, casting crimson light across the water. Fifteen minutes later,they arrived.



They walked a short distance and turned a corner.What Millie saw left her speechless.


The street ahead looked likesomething from a dream. Crystals lined the path. Smoke from the burning exotic herbs and spices floated in the air, its scent rich and mysterious. All kinds of strange and beautiful sights surrounded them.


Just past the entrance, something caught Millie's eye.


A man in a wizard's robe stood beneath a lantern. He performed tricks with ease, pulling objects from nowhere. At one point, a glowing ring appeared in his hand, and with a flick, it turned into several balloons tied on a string.
Millie watched closely, trying to see how he did it.


Before she could figure it out, he bowed and handed her the balloons.



She turned to Myron, only to realize he had vanished while she was distracted by the magic show.


The string of balloons was already in her hand.


The scent of herbs and spices drifted closer. From a nearby window, a stream of bubbles floated out,surrounding her.


In the glow of the setting sun, the scene felt like something out of a fairy tale.


Holding the string of balloons in one hand, Millie reached out with the other to poke the colorful bubbles.



One large bubble, wrapped in several smaller ones,burst softly. A man appeared where it had been.


He wore a black suit and a half-mask. White gloves covered his hands, and he held a top hat.
He turned the hat upside down and showed her that it was empty.


Once he had her attention, he reached toward her shoulder, pulled something invisible from the air,and dropped it into the hat.


A moment later, he lifted out a white dove. Its wings flapped against the wind.


"Wow," Millie whispered. She had seen the hat was empty.


The man placed the dove gently on her shoulder.It settled there without fear and began to co0.


She moved slightly, but it didn't fly away.


Just then, a sharp snap of fingers made her turn.


The magician smiled at her.


Again, he turned the hat over and showed it was empty.


This time, he reached toward her other shoulder and repeated the motion.
He dug into the hat, moving his hand as though searching for something hidden.


A soft breeze passed through. Bubbles drifted by in its wake. From inside the hat, he pulled out a half-mask. It sparkled with colorful gems.


He tipped the hat once more. Petals spilled out and floated to the ground. Then he bowed and offered the mask to Millie.



She hesitated for a moment, but then took it.



When he straightened, another snap of fingers brought forth a folded paper. It appeared on his chest and fluttered in place. She read the words,"Would you wear it for me?"



The handwriting was familiar.


She looked at the figure before her and smiled.


"Okay," she said softly, placing the mask over her face.



The man watched her, his eyes warm.
When the mask was in place, he removed the paper.


With a flick ofhis hand, the paper caught fire. Its glow lit up Millie's face.


As the flames vanished, a red rose appeared in his hand.



He bowed again and offered it to her.



The rose glowed in the soft light. Its scent mingled perfectly with the herbs and spices. Around them,bubbles shimmered, and the dove cooed gently on her shoulder.



She stared at the rose. Something about the moment felt familiar, as though she had seen it before.



"Could you accept it?" he asked.


Millie smiled, shaking off the strange feeling.


She took the rose, still wondering how he had made it appear.



Then he extended his right hand.
"My dear lady, may I have the pleasure of showing you around the island?" It was Myron's voice.


"Certainly," she replied, ready to take his hand.


But one of her hands held the rose, and the other held the balloons.



He glanced at the balloons. She understood and released the string.


They floated upward. He took her hand.


Their eyes met, both smiling.


He led her into the crowd.



The sun had dipped below the horizon. The island shifted intonight.


Their first stop was a boutique known for its detailed designs.


As they arrived, a staff member stepped forward.


"Miss Bennett?" the woman said with a smile."Please come with us."


Millie glanced at Myron. He nodded.



She followed the staff member inside.



They dressed her in a gown covered in gemstones.It matched the half-mask perfectly. The woman in the mirror looked radiant.


When Millie stepped outside, the magician was gone,but a man stood waiting. His clothes matched hers perfectly.


"Myron?" she called out.


She already knew it was him.


"It's me," he answered.



He held out his hand again. She placed hers in his.


They walked back to the street.


In the short time Millie had changed, night had fully arrived.



Now the island shimmered with unusual lights.Lamps glowed beside trails of floating smoke. They flickered like stars.


If viewed from the sky, the lights would spell out one name.Millie.
###Chapter 200 | Want To Be The Imperial Consort

Energy surged across the little island as people flowed in from every direction, drawn by the excitement in the air.


Tonight's event welcomed all, but there was a dress code, so guests arrived in their finest, eager to join the festivities.


Glowing lights shimmered across the water, and more than a few guests speculated about the significance behind the dazzling display.


Someone even managed to catch Myron's impromptu magic show for Millie on video and posted it online, where it instantly began making the rounds. Viewers everywhere were transfixed,swept up by the impossible wonder of it all.


"Wait, is the island this lively just because Myron wanted to put a smile on Millie's face? That's actually adorable."



"Seriously, am I the only one dying to know how he pulled off those tricks? I need to learn them-I've got to impress my girlfriend somehow!"


"I'm in,too!"


As chatter buzzed through the crowd, Egbert caught sight of the video.


He was halfway through dinner and nearly choked on his food.



"That bastard Myron-he really played me!" Egbert slammed his fork onto the table, cursing under his breath. "He's got that whole bookish act going,but underneath he's as slippery as they come. One minute he seems to know nothing about romance,the next he's pulling stunts just to impress Millie!"


Steam practically billowed from Egbert's ears.


He'd been plotting his own big gesture, especially since Flesta had a reputation as the country of romance. But now Myron had stolen the spotlight right out from under him.


His jaw clenched at the memory of Myron shoving that wooden fox sculpture he was offering Millie as a gift right back into his hands, making himn look like a fool.



"No way I'm letting this slide." Without another thought, Egbert yanked on a fresh shirt and thundered down the stairs.



At the same time, Brandon caught the video too.


He'd only just gotten back after dropping Vivian off.


It was Vivian who pulled up the video and handed it to him.



"Looks like Myron's got his eye on Millie," Vivian remarked,voice lilting with mischief.


Brandon's jaw clenched, but he refused to give her the satisfaction of a response.


Vivian's eyes danced with amusement. "First he made blue rain falling just for her, then a cozy fishing trip, and now he's got her grinning on that island with his little magic show. Honestly, Millie doesn't look like she's resisting. Maybe she's finally ready to say yes to him?"



Her words stung, each syllable twisting the knife.


Brandon felt something tight and bitter coil in his chest.



When did Myron start putting on a show like that?







On the island, Myron was already weaving Millie through the bustling streets, his hand clasped lightly around hers.



He led her from one breathtaking spot to the next.


He paused at a spice vendor, flashing Millie a playful grin. "Check these out. I acquired them from a small village in Gliphis."


With a flick of his wrist, Myron scattered a pinch of  the spices onto an open flame.


The fire caught instantly, swirling up a strange, wild aroma that drifted on the breeze.



Millie breathed it in, the scent so earthy and sharp it conjured the image of a deer bolting through the morning mist.


"Wait," Myron murmured, moving closer. He tied a delicate sachet at her belt, letting his fingers linger.


The scent was unmistakable-exactly the same as the one he'd just lit moments ago.


This made the fifth sachet he'd fastened to her belt that night.


Millie broke into laughter, shaking her head."Honestly, you're making me feel like I'm in one of those palace dramas, where the emperor ends up with a whole collection of sachets dangling from his waist-each one from a different concubine."



Myron flashed a mischievous grin. "In that case, I guess you'll have to think of me as one of your pampered wives, Your Majesty."


She stared at him, speechless for a second, untif he lifted a single finger, eyes twinkling.


"But I'm putting in a special request," he added."want to be the imperial consort."



Millie rolled her eyes with theatrical exasperation but couldn't hide her smile. Myron burst out laughing,the easy camaraderie between them lighting up the street.



They both understood it was nothing more than playful banter.


As they wandered on, Myron steered her toward a small stall tucked between busier vendors.


The tabletop overflowed with polished stones, each one smooth and cool to the touch.



"Check this out," Myron said, his tone low and conspiratorial. He grabbed an object and carefully set it atop a nearby stone.

In an instant, the stone ignited, flames twisting upward in a swirl of blue and gold, casting strange shadows over their faces.



"Wow!" Millie took a startled step back, her lips parting in awe.


"Doesn't it look like a heart set on fire?" Myron asked, a mischievous grin flashing across his face.


Excitement danced in Millie's eyes, her whole expression alight with wonder.


It was almost uncanny how much it resembled a heart.



The flame quickly flickered out, but Myron's attention never wavered-he watched Millie with an intensity that sent a thrill down her spine, as if he could see the same wild spark kindling in her eyes.


He laced his fingers through hers, steady and certain, and led her onward, weaving through the bustling crowd until they reached the heart of the island-a sprawling square ablaze with life.
At its center, a towering bonfire roared, its flames illuminating a swirling sea of dancers dressed in vibrant, unfamiliar costumes. Laughter and music rose into the night.



Without a word, Myron took Millie's hand and swept her into the rhythm of the dancers.


They stood inches apart, Millie's eyes fixed on Myron's masked face, flickering in the firelight.


Millie gazed up at him, her pulse racing. For a moment, she had the disorienting sense that she'd seen him like this before.







A motorboat tore across the waves toward the island,churning up a frothy wake behind it.


At the helm, Egbert muttered a steady stream of curses, his eyes narrowed with impatience.


He gripped something in his hand, but the object stayed hidden in shadow.

"Myron, you slippery bastard, just wait tilf i get my hands on you!" Egbert bellowed over the roar of the engine.


The moment the bow scraped the shore,he leapt off without waiting for the boat to stop, landing hard on the sand.



Egbert barely broke stride, yanking out his phone to check the latest intel from his network.


A new message flashed on his screen-"They're caught in a dance, right in the middle of the bustling central square."


With a muttered curse, Egbert broke into a sprint,racing for the central square.







In the center of the bustling square, Millie gazed at Myron, her mind drifting to a distant winter night.


Christmas-the air heavy with the scent of mulled wine and fresh snow, music spilling into the streets as revelers whirled across the icy square.
Amid the chaos, a masked man with a faint trace of blood on his sleeve had pulled her close, winding his thick Christmas scarf around her shoulders, shielding her from the biting cold. That warmth, so vivid, came rushing back to her now.


She felt as if a buried memory was stirring awake.


A slow, secretive smile played behind Myron's mask as he lingered before her. With their faces hidden,only their eyes met-each searching the other and finding an unspoken spark reflected back.


Though not a drop of wine had touched her lips that night, Millie felt an odd, heady dizziness, as if the world around them had tilted slightly out of focus.


A sudden craving for mulled wine crept up on her-rich and comforting.


Before she could voice it, Myron steered her through the bustling crowd, pausing at a small stall where steam curled over pots of mulled wine.


He pressed a warm cup into her hands, anticipation glimmering in his gaze.


Even with the heat of the day, Millie welcomed the drink, lifting it to her lips without hesitation.


The wine was gentle-more soothing than strong layered with flavors-and she let it linger on her tongue.


"ls it to your taste?" Myron's voice drifted over her shoulder, low and coaxing.


Millie nodded, her eyes lingering on the red liquid swirling in her cup. She murmured, "Yeah. I like it."


Myron glanced at his watch, the movement almost secretive, and then shot a quick look across the street.



A knowing grin tugged at his lips. "Come on. There's something I want to show you."


Setting her cup aside, Millie fell into step beside him,curiosity prickling at her skin.


He led her around the corner-where an enormous air balloon, vibrant and otherworldly, hovered at the ready.


Myron turned to her, his eyes dancing. "How about a ride?"



"Of course," Millie replied, slipping into the basket alongside him.


They were alone, enclosed by the curved wicker and the faint tang of propane. Myron deftly worked the controls, and the balloon surged upward, rising above the patchwork streets and distant rooftops.


The higher it rose, the smaller the world became-yet Millie noticed a figure below on the ground, jumping furiously, their identity lost in the distance.


She turned toward Myron, catching the glimmer of mischief in his eyes.


"Who was that down there?" she asked, her voice light.


"Egbert," Myron answered, his lips curving into a crooked grin. "He tried to cut us off, but I had omeone tip me off the moment he set foot on the island."


The memory of Egbert's wild thrashing made Millie break into helpless laughter, the sound bubbling up and carried off by the wind.
###Chapter 201 The Moments When I Loved You


Egbert stood on the ground below, glaring up as the hot air balloon drifted higher. Frustration burned in his chest.

He could do nothing but watch it rise beyond his reach.

Inside the balloon, Millie looked out over the island, watching it slowly unfold beneath her.

Then, she saw what Myron had prepared.

The entire island shimmered with lights, arranged to form one glowing word-"Millie."

"Wow," she whispered, staring as the island grew smaller below.

She turned toward Myron, who stood beside her,his hands now off the controls.

He still wore a half-face mask. His gaze stayed fixed on her.

"Why go to such lengths?" she asked quietly. "Am I really worth it?"

He understood her doubts. He knew her fears.

Being with her might even mean a future without their own children.

He could have chosen someone else. Someone healthier and stronger. Someone with a simpler background.

But instead of answering her questions, he opened a nearby box and took out a necklace

with a heart-shaped blue diamond pendant.

"Because of this," he said.

Milie stared at the pendant. Memories rushed in.

"Do you remember?" he asked, meeting her eyes.
Slowly,he removed his mask. There was a trace of sadness in his gaze.

"Millie," he said, his voice low. "I've waited for you. It feels like forever. After all these years, I can finally return this to you."

Memories came flooding back. She remembered it all, the events from years past.

She had been a child when her father, James, took her to Mirough. He showed her the empire he had built.They traveled together, and she saw his influence everywhere.

At the time, James stood at the peak of his power. Millie, his only daughter, was welcomed wherever she went.

The moment they arrived in Mirough, people flooded in with gifts, seeking favors. But she had already grown tired of that kind of attention.

She didn't know then that, within a year, her father would fall from a tall building and leave her forever.

She did know something though-people only valued her because of who her father was. One word from him could change a person's life.

With her father's permission, Millie visited the port, guarded by bodyguards.

"was just a teenager thenMyron said. "My family had sent me out to the sea to handle shipping. We met at the port." He paused.

"My father had failed in a family power struggle. He was supposed to fixit, but he died. My mother had to raise my younger siblings, and I took over. The sea is chaotic. Once you're out in uncharted waters, people vanish without explanation. Men disappear, thrown overboard. I was too young. My crew barely respected me. Just staying alive was hard. I couldn't even think about exploring new territory."

Then,he smiled. "And then I met you."

He looked at Millie.

"You gave me this. You told me to seek help from the Bennett family's men."
He turned the pendant, showing her the name "Bennett" etched in an ancient, totem-like script.

"With this, I found the Bennett family. I actually met your father that same day. I received help from both of you. Within a year,I managed to gather my crew and take control. I was on the sea pretty much all year around, and I only heard the news of your father's death almost a year later. I wanted to do something but there wasn't much I could do. And then I realized-I still wasn't strong enough to find the truth."

The balloon floated gently in the sky.

Millie stared at the necklace. She had never imagined the boy she once met would one day stand before her like this.

Back then, she hadn't thought much of it. She only wanted to help a struggling young man from the same homeland, speaking the same language.

She reached out and held the pendant.

Myron noticed the emotion in her eyes.

They had been just kids and their meeting had been brief.

To her,it was a small gesture of kindness. To him, it was everything.

Back then, he saw her and James as his saviors.

He had been powerless. But he made himself a promise-he would become strong, and he would learn the truth behind James' death.

Later, betrayal brought them together again.

And the bullet that should have killed him led him to her instead.

"When I returned," he said,"you were already with Brandon. Married, even. I kept digging into your father's death, but the truth kept slipoping away. I noticed a hidden force behind everything, and I couldn't get past it.I had to wait for the right moment."

Many had tried to uncover James' death throughout the years. Although Myron had been one of them,he  couldn't risk exposing his link to the Bennett family. That would only bring more danger.

Even now,he confessed his love only in the stillness of the sky.

He had believed that Brandon loved Millie and treated her well, that she would be safe with him.

So Myron buried his feelings.

But now, Brandon had let her go.

Now, it was his turn.

He would love her fully. Without fear.

A single tear fell from Millie's cheek, landing on the blue diamond.

She looked at the pendant in her hand.

After her father's death and the fall of the Bennett family, she had almost nothing left from her past.

This was one of the treasures he once gifted her, which made it extremely special.

"Don't cry," Myron said. He reached out, removed her mask, and gently wiped her tears.

He cupped her face, looking into her eyes.

"Trust me, Millie," he said. "We'll find the truth. We'll bring the Bennett family back. It's only a matter of time.Just trust me."

She stared at him,overwhelmed by emotion.

Then,softly, she asked, "Will you help me put it on?"

"Of course," he said, taking the necklace from her and fastening it around her neck.

The gemstone settled against her skin, steady and warm. It felt like another heartbeat.

"Where are we going now?" she asked. "To relive the moments when I loved you," Myron said. "I want you to know-my love for you isn't gratitude.t isn't a way to prove anything. I love you, Millie. Truly. Simply because I love you."
###Chapter 202 Nothing But A Single Stolen Moment With Her


A magnificent hot air balloon drifted through the navy blue sky, while far below, a sleek luxury car carved its path along winding roads.

Brandon had delivered Vivian safely to her doorstep, yet he refused to cross the threshold into her home.

Her voice had grown more insistent with each invitation, but he remained steadfast in his decision to leave.

He understood exactly what desires burned in Vivian's eyes, though he coudn't bring himself to fulfill them.

The digital world buzzed with fervent discussions about Millie and Myron's blossoming romance.

Witness after witness emerged, each painting vivid pictures of Myron's unwavering devotion to her.

"Seriously, does Myron still insist he's pursuing her? Has Millie actually accepted his advances yet?"

"Nobody's heard anything about Millie giving him the green light."

"Does anyone have insight into Brandon's thoughts about this situation? His former wife, barely divorced,now finds herself at the center of Myron's spectacular courtship!"

"Haven't Brandon and Vivian become an item long before Myron did anything? They ought to make it official and move forward."

"Perhaps,but Vivian will be gone in barely four months-what path will Brandon choose then?"

"Nobody can predict that outcome."

Each comment Brandon consumed deepened the turmoil churning within his chest.

He couldn't decipher Myron's true motives.

Was this elaborate display designed to torment him personally, or did it serve to weaken the Watson family's standing? Then there was Millie's role in this theater.

She possessed enough intelligence to recognize that accepting Myron's public invitations would ignite media firestorms and fuel gossip mills. Yet she continued to say yes.

Brandon's mind raced with possibilities-did fragmets of love for Him still linger in her heart? Had she finally abandoned her vigil of waiting for his return?

That rain-soaked evening haunted his memory, when he'd-summoned the courage to ask whether love stil lived within her.

He still vividly remembered her response had been a simple, devastating

The traffic light blazed red ahead, forcing Brandon to slam his brakes with sudden violence.

His gaze lifted instinctively upward, and through the car's sunroof, he imagined glimpsing that distant hot air balloon suspended against the evening sky.

He remained transfixed by this phantom vision until the light shifted to green and angry horns shattered his trance, demanding his attention return to the present moment.

Denial surged through every fiber of his being; he refused to surrender her to Myron's embrace.

He would never permit such a betrayal of his heart.


·.·

High above the earth, Myron expertly maneuvered the hot air balloon's controls, guiding their gradual descent toward a predetermined destination.

Millie remained motionless beside him, her emotions wreaking havoc within her soul.

The revelation of buried truths and the unexpected return of a treasured artifact from years past had left her reeling in emotional chaos.

Now that the storm within her had finally quieted, numbness had settled over her like a heavy blanket. She pressed the blue diamond against her chest, its cool surface grounding her as she studied Myron's profile. Eventually, their aerial journey concluded as the balloon made contact with solid ground, prompting a small army of crew members to rush forward and secure their vessel.

Myron extended his hand, helping her navigate the portable steps the staff had positioned beside their basket.

Millie surveyed their surroundings with growing recognition-they had landed within walking distance of Elliott Mansion.

Their sky-bound voyage had consumed far more time than she'd initially realized.

"Come with me," Myron murmured, his fingers intertwining with hers as he led her toward a waiting shuttle vehicle.

The evening breeze whispered against their skin, and he noticed the telltale signs of her earlier tears-swollen eyelids still tinged with red from weeping. An emotion he couldn't quite name stirred within his chest.

She would never comprehend the truth that had shaped his existence-that she had always represented his most impossible dream.

Her self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy had never diminished her worth in his eyes.

His memory transported him back to that pivotal day at the harbor, when failure in family power struggle had stripped him of everything while she commanded attention from countless admirers, radiating elegance and grace.

Her lustrous hair had cascaded in gentle waves past her shoulders, and her smooth skin had gleamed beneath expensive jewelry that spoke of privilege and refinement.

Despite her queenly bearing and the crowd of suitors surrounding her, she had pushed through their ranks with determined purpose, seeking him out among the masses and extending a delicate pendant toward him.

"Take this-it will guide you toward better days," she had whispered, her voice carrying across the years to reach him in this present moment. Without that fateful encounter and the precious gift she had bestowed upon him, the unforgiving ocean would have claimed his life in some forgotten corner of its depths.

In her radiant presence, he had always remained the perpetual underdog, forever reaching toward something beyond his grasp.

Millie absorbed the nocturnal landscape unfolding around them, her emotions remaining an enigma even to herself,unwilling to excavate memories from the past, following Myron with passive resignation.

Their vehicle glided through the imposing gates of Elliott Mansion, navigating the serpentine pathways that wound through manicured gardens before drawing to a halt directly in front of the grand main residence.

"Welcome back, sir!"

"Good evening, Mr.Elliott!"

A chorus of respectful greetings erupted from the assembled staff, though Myron acknowledged them with only brief nods, his hand guiding Millie past ornate rockeries and tranquil ponds toward the house's entrance.

The timeless elegance of Elliott Mansion's classical interior design seemed to mirror Myron's sophisticated character perfectly.

Millie had wandered these very halls before, accompanying Ari during playful visits centered around the mansion's beloved feline resident-Kiki.

"Meow!"

The moment they crossed the threshold, an exquisitely fluffy ragdoll cat materialized to welcome them,weaving elegant figure-eights around their ankles while its luxurious tail swayed like a ceremonial banner.

"Behave yourself properly," Myron addressed the mischievous feline with gentle authority.

Millie's face brightened with genuine warmth as she crouched down to stroke the cat's silky fur.

Truthfully, she harbored deep affection for this charming creature. "Jayceon relocated to his own residence recently," Myron mentioned casually as they began their ascent up the mansion's sweeping staircase.

Millie nodded in acknowledgment, puzzled by his decision to share this information, though she recognized that this moment hardly provided the appropriaté time to analyze his motivations.

She maintained her position just behind him as they approached a particular room's elaborately carved entrance.

"What you're about to witness might overwhelm you." Myron paused at the threshold, his hand hesitating on the ornate door handle. "I wrestled with this decision for a considerable amount of time before concluding that you deserve to see what lies beyond this threshold."

Millie braced herself mentally, drawing upon her inner reserves of strength as she nodded her consent.

The door swung open to reveal rows upon rows of carefully arranged shelving units stretching into the dimly lit space beyond.

With the room shrouded in darkness, she found herself unable to distinguish the specific contents of each carefully arranged display.

Fortunately, no terrifying totems or disturbing artifacts greeted her initial inspection.

Myron's hand found the light switch, instantly flooding the room with brilliant illumination that revealed the shelves' extraordinary contents.

Paintings filled every available surface, and every single canvas bore her likeness captured in exquisite detail.

The discovery genuinely stole her breath and left her reeling with disbelief.

"Sorry," Myron murmured quietly, his voice heavy with remorse. "Now you might properly think I'm a creep."④

Millie steadied herself, glanced questioningly at Myron, and blinked repeatedly in complete bewilderment.

What strange circumstances had led to this moment? Why did every artwork feature her as the subject? The sheer scope of his obsession felt both flattering and deeply unsettling.

"Please, come with me," Myron requested, extending his hand once again to guide her deeper into the cavernous space.

They ventured deeper into what she now reallżed was an expansive gallery rather than merely a single room.He led her directly to one specific shelf, where he activated a small spotlight and carefully unrolled a canvas that had been stored with obvious reverence.

The painting depicted her younger self dancing with joyful abandon in a snow-covered town square from years past. Her hand was clasped securely in someone else's grip, a festive Christmas scarf wrapped snugly around her neck, while she beamed with pure joy at the mysterious figure beyond the canvas's edge.

Positioned beside this painted memory sat a faded photograph and an intricately crafted mask.

The cobblestone square, magical Christmas Eve atmosphere, charming red-roofed houses, and pristine blanket of snow-everything transported her into what felt like stepping directly into an enchanted fairy tale.

There had been steaming mulled red wine available that evening as well.

Millie's lips parted slightly as recogntion dawned with startling clarity.

The mask triggered a flood of buried memories, and she slowly turned to face Myron with dawning comprehension.

"The masked dancer was mMyron confirmed, his voice carrying the weight of long-held secrets."1t marked the first occasion I summoned enough courage to approach you."

During that pivotal period, he had been fighting for his very survival, his chest bearing a potentially fatal gunshot wound that had nearly claimed his ife.

The harsh conditions aboard the ship had severely hampered his recovery process, requiring two grueling months before his body had healed sufficiently to function normally again.

Christmas Eve had arrived, presenting him with an unexpected opportunity to encounter her in that magical square.
He had made a life-altering decision in that moment-to embrace bravery for once in his cautious existence.

Even though his heart recognized that her deepest affections belonged to another man, he craved nothing more than a single stolen moment to hold her in his arms as they moved together to the music.

He hadn't fully comprehended the depth of his feelings during that time, yet witnessing her willingness to sacrifice everything for someone else had awakened something profound and transformative within his soul.

Gradually, that extraordinary sensation had blossomed into genuine, all-consuming love.

This single act of bravery had planted the seeds of his devotion, marking the first meaningful encounter between two adults who had shared a brief connection during their distant youth.

Despite the anonymity provided by his mask, this hadn't been a stolen glance or a fleeting glimpse from the shadows-it had been a face-to-face meeting, a formal introduction between equals.
###Chapter 203 You Don't Need To Answer Yet


Millie looked at Myron, her gaze steady.

"That was a long time ago," she whispered, her eyes faintly shining.

Myron nodded, a small smile on his lips. "Yes. A very long time ago."

From then until now, his feelings for her had never faded-not for a single day.

Even after she married someone else, he had watched from a distance. On her wedding day, he had seen her in a white dress, standing beside another man, smiling beneath a sky filled with fireworks.

He had felt jealousy rise in his chest.

That was why he wanted to create an even more magnificent fireworks display of his own on the day of her divorce. He wanted to outshine anything Brandon had ever done. He needed her to remember him and him alone. He wanted a place in her heart.

"Come with me," he said, noticing the tears in her eyes. He led her to a series of paintings.

"This one shows you buying spices at the port," he said, pointing to a painting and the photo beside it.

"And this.., this is from Eldoria. You and Brandon were trapped then. That was the first time I stepped in to help you escape."

Millie stopped, her eyes drawn to the image of a small boat.

She remembered that year clearly-the rushed escape, the fear of the boat sinking, the uncertainty about who or what might lie ahead.

In that cramped cabin, she and Brandon had clung to each other, the world outside reduced to waves and silence.

Only now did she learn that Myron had been part of that escape. "I took care of the problems you left behind in Eldoria," he said. "I arranged for my men to escort your boat.I wanted to make sure you got out safely."

He had stood on the deck of his own boat back then, watching theirs disappear with her aboard.

"I discovered Blue Rain while I was there," he added.

Millie recalled their first date. The sky above them had shimmered with soft blue rain.

She remembered him saying he had watched it alone that night from the deck back in Eldoria.

Myron gently took her hand as they walked from one painting to the next. Each was paired with a photograph or a keepsake from the past.①

He spoke in a low voice, recounting stories from across the years-from faraway countries and from the time after his return.

One painting stood out. It showed her in a wedding dress, the moment she married Brandon.

They walked on until they reached the final painting.

They stopped in front of it, standing quietly, side by side.

Only then did Millie realize just how many moments Myron had witnessed in silence. He had seen her life unfold with Brandon. He had watched their love grow.

He had spoken only of when and where the paintings had come together. But the depth of his feelings came through without a word.

She felt a heaviness in her chest. She had never imagined he had loved her like this.

A tear slipped from her eye and landed on the hand that still held hers.

He felt it.Without letting go, he reached up and gently wiped her cheek.

"Don't cry," he whispered. "I didn't bring you here to make you cry. I don't want you to feel sad. I hate seeing you cry." Millie tried to speak, but her voice faltéred. Her emotions tangled togethor, and wordt tefused to come.

The room stayed silont. Only the sound of then breaths filled the space.

After a pause, Myron gently wlped another tear from her cheek.

Then, hesltating for a moment, he putled her into à quiet embrace,resting her forehead against hls chest.

She didn't resist. The tension in his shoulders eased.

He patted her back, his voice low and steady.my fault. I shouldn't have brought you here. But I only wanted to show you that my feelings aren't just words.I meant it. Every word. You can frust me."

Millie looked up at hlm.

His eyes were rimmed with red, softening his expression.

For years, she had seen him as distant. A powerful man who returned from the sea and led the Elliott Group with his siblings. He had always seemed composed, mysterious.

Rumors said he had nearly died at sea. Somne said betrayal had broken him.

She thought he had someone he loved all along.

But she never imagined that person was her.

She didn't know how to carry that kind of love.

Since losing her father, she had given up hope of unconditional care. Everything felt like a struggle.Everything had to be earned.

What happened between Brandon and Vivian had shattered her even more.

The day she lost her child when she fell nearly ended her. If Alexia hadn't arranged the blood donation, she might not have survived.

Since then, she kept her hopes quiet. She didn't let herself want more.

But Myron had now shown her so much love. "Myron,"she said softly.

"Yes?" he replied.

She lowered her eyes, nearly voicing what was on her heart. "l..

"You don't need to answer yet," he said gently."Take your time. I want you to think it over. No decislons made in a moment. Only what you won't regret when your feelings settle."

She looked at him in the warm light.

He always understood her. He always gave her space and respected her boundaries.

Her heart pounded.

"Okay," she said with a small, tearful smile.

He smiled back, still a little red around the eyes.

"You were thinking of spending time with the cat, weren't you?" he asked. "Shall we go find it? I thinkit really likes you. It usually doesn't cling to me like that."

Millie nodded."Let's go." They left the room together.

She glanced back as he turned off the lights and closed the door.

"Meow."

The chubby ragdoll cat appeared, circling her feet, tail raised high, rubbing against her legs

"Kiki,there you arshe said, crouching down to stroke its fluffy head.

Myron joined her, pulling out a few treats and handing them to her.

Millie fed the cat, smiling as she remembered how Jayceon had almost named it Fatty. The thought made her laugh a little.

After a while, Millie changed back into her earlier casual clothes, and Myron prepared to take her home. But as soon as they reached the entrance of Elliott Mansion, their path was blocked.

###Chapter 204 Kissing Myron In Front Of Brandon


It was Brandon.

The moment Millie saw him, her mood soured. She remembered the last time he had shown up at her doorstep without warning.

Hadn't he already chosen Vivian? Why did he keep showing up, interfering in her life?

And now, he had come to Myron's home.

Myron led her out just as Brandon stepped forward.

Millie didn't want to engage. She intended to walk past him and head straight for Myron's Bentley.

"You two went out again," Brandon said, his eyes red as they lingered on herface.

"Obviously," Millie answered, not slowing her pace.

Brandon noticed the slight redness around her eyes. She looked like she had been crying.

His chest tightened. He wanted to ask what had happened. He wanted to reach out. But she pushed his hand away.

"Did he upset you?" Brandon asked, glancing toward Myron with suspicion.

"No," Millie replied. She stepped closer to Myron. "Brandon, we're divorced. Don't touch me."

That instinctive move toward Myron, her calm words, and the ease with which she pushed Brandon aside-it all struck him at once.

His heart twisted. "Don't forget,"Brandon said, his voice hoarse."You're still in a contest with Vivian. The assets from the Bennett family are stiIl with the Watson Group."

Millie paused, looking up at him.

"I know," she said. "And if you've been paying attention, you should have noticed I've been working hard to win."

Brandon bit his lip, the pain etched deep in his features. He glanced at Myron again.

"So this is your strategy?" he asked. "You go out with him so he'lf help you? Is that what this is?"

"Watch your mouth, Brandon," Myron said sharply, stepping in front of her.

Millie raised her hand, signaling she could handle it.

She had ignored Brandon for weeks. She had been patient and waited for the necessary legal procedures to be done, and then finalized their divorce.

She thought she had been clear.

But Brandon never seemed to understand.

If that was the case, it was time to be clearer.

"Don't insult me," Millie said. "I'm going to win the contest on my own."

They had been together for years, sharing countless days and nights. And now he stood before her,accusing her like this. Was this really the same man she had once loved?

Before Brandon could speak, she continued, "We're already divorced. There's nothing left between us."

His breath caught. The pain on his face deepened. His eyes blurred with emotion.

"What are you saying?" he asked quietly.

"I'm saying I don't love you anymore, Brandon," she said.

Brandon froze.

He had clung so tightly to the idea that their love was unbreakable, that it would survive anything, that one day,she would return to him.

But her words now shattered that belief.

"You're just saying this to hurt me," he said. "You don't mean it."

He tried to find an explanation.

Was she trying to win the contest? Was this her revenge? Was it anger?

But when he looked into her eyes, he saw no cruelty. Just clarity.

"I'm not trying to hurt you," she said. "I really don't love you anymore."

"You..."

"I don't look back," she said. "When you chose Vivian, whatever we had, it ended there. The divorce was just a formality."

She didn't deny what they once had, nor that she had once loved him deeply. But that love was long gone.

"Brandon," she said, meeting his eyes one final time. "We can't go back."

She looked away, her voice quiet. "I think l've said enough. Please don't bother me again. It would only make things harder."

She turned to Myron and gave him a small nod, ready to leave with him.

But Brandon caught her wrist.

His grip was tight. His eyes were red. She could see the tears welling up.

"Millie," he whispered. "Are you lying to me? We've been through so much. We've survived so much."

His voice trembled. "We've faced death together. You can't just-"

Millie tried to pull away, but he held on. His fingers tightened. She stared at him, genuinely confused.

HHe had been the one to break their vows. He had been the one to stray first.

"What do I have to say for you to believe me?" she asked.

He said nothing. He just stood there, clutching her wrist.

Fine," she said.

She gave á small nod and closed her eyes for a moment.

Brandon thought she might soften. He thought her heart might sway. But she turned toward Myron instead.

"In the art room earlier,"she said,"you asked me to take time to think. You said Í shouldn't decide anything in a moment of emotion."

Myron's eyes sharpened. He listened carefully.

She said his name."Myron."

He responded gently, "Yes?"

"I've thought it through," she said. "And I've decided. Let's be together."

Something cracked in the air.

Her wrist ached under Brandon's grip. But she didn't look back.

She looked only at Myron.

There was no joy in his face. Only concern.

He feared she was speaking out of anger towards Brandon. But Millie knew her own heart, and she'd prove it to him.

She had taken her time and calmed her thoughts. And now she knew exactly what she truly wanted.

"I mean it," she said. "My heart is racing for you."

Before Myron could say anything, she stepped closer.

She raised her free hand and placed it gently around his neck. She stood on her toes and kissed him.

It was soft. It was brief. But it was enough. She pulled away quickly, her cheeks flushed.

Myron trembled.. Then he pulled her into his arms, holding her tightly, as if he never wanted to let go. His warmth surrounded her,steady and strong.

Yet her other wrist still hurt from Brandon's grip.

###Chapter 205 Would You Let Me Kiss You


Resting in Myron's embrace, Milie caught the faint, wavering sound of her own name leaving Brandon's lips.

Shifting slightly, she glimpsed him-standing alone, mouth drawn in a tight, silent line.

An endless void seemed to stretch behind him, sorrow clouding his gaze.

No trace of anger crossed his face-just the hollow ache of loss.

A solitary tear found its way down his cheek, quiet and unbidden.

He squeezed his eyes shut in a futile attempt to rein in his feelings, but the grief was too strong.

With his brow knitted in pain, Brandon dropped his eyes and drew in a shaky breath, studying the ground at his feet.

It wasn't until he sensed her attention that he finally forced himself to meet her stare.

"Is this really how it ends?" His words faltered, voice raw with hurt.

Millie gave no answer, only shifted her hand,still pinned within his grasp.

"Let me go," she said, the request soft but unwavering.

Brandon's fingers stayed locked around hers, unwilling to release her.

While she tried to pull away, a warm tear struck the back of her hand.

"You're hurting me." Millie turned her face away from him, her eyes settling instead on Myron.

Her resolve wouldn't waver-not for a single tear on Brandon's cheek.

In fact, this decision had been settled in her heart long before today.

One by one, Myron pried Brandon's fingers loose, breaking his grip until Millie's hand slipped free. Brandon's gaze never faltered; he watched her intently.

Millie kept her back to him, refusing to look ovér her shoulder.

The final finger fell away, and she quietly reclaimed her hand.

A desperate urge flickered in Brandon's eyes, but Myron blocked his path, motioning to his men nearby.

Elliott Mansion loomed behind them, its entrance ringed with Myron's security team.

With a subtle gesture, Myron gave the order, and his people closed in, restraining Brandon with practiced efficiency.

"We should go," Millie murmured, her voice barely above a whisper, never glancing in Brandon's direction.

"Of course." Myron nodded, offering a gentle touch to her wrist, soothing the angry marks Brandon had left behind. Together,they headed for the waiting Bentley.

It wasn't far to the car. Myron circled to the passenger side, opened the door, and braced his hand against the frame, making sure she entered safely.

"Millie."

Just as she reached for the passenger door, Brandon's voice rose up behind her once more.

Her reflexes took over, and she lifted her eyes to meet his.

That gentle tone-soft,weighted with longing-echoed memories from better days.

She remembered telling him, once, how much she cherished that way her parents used to speak so lovingly to each other, and how she wanted that tenderness between them,too.

But after setting her heart on this new path, Millie hadn't let herself soften for him again.

"It's not what you think with Vivian." Brandon's words drifted over the space between them. "I only need a little more time. There's still four months-"

Millie broke eye contact, slid into the car, and left his words behind.
Myron stepped up and shut her door with care before moving around to the driver's side.

Pausing for a heartbeat, he turned toward her with a gentle smile. "Just wait here. Fl be right back."

"Alright," she replied quietly, nodding her assent.

Myron gently eased the door closed before making his way back toward Brandon.

Silence stretched as their stares collided.

Drawing out the pocket square from his jacket, Myron carefully wiped Brandon's tears away before slipping the fabric into Brandon's coat pocket.

"She belongs with me now," Myron declared coolly, each syllable distinct and unwavering. "If you have tears to shed, Vivian's the one you should go to. Don't disgrace yourself by breaking down in front of the woman who's mine."

"Myron!" Brandon's voice cracked with desperation, eyes raw and inflamed. He lunged forward, but Myron's men gripped him tightly, pinning him firmly in place.

"You've spent forever telling me you needed time, claimning you had your reasons," Myron said softly, eyes steady and voice controlled. He then leaned closer, voice turning hard as stone. "But none of your reasons justify causing her this kind of pain."

Brandon struggled furiously, pulling uselessly against their hold.

Myron merely observed, indifferent to Brandon's desperation.

"You seem blind to your own actions, so let me refresh your memories. Competing with her viciously over the tanzanite, standing idly by as Vivian tormented herrelentlessly on Heavenly Melody, refusing to give her the peace she deserved-those actions only scratch the surface of what you've done. You still have no idea how much you've thrown away. But the day will come when you understand exactly what you've lost, and on that day, resentment won't haunt you-only the bitter truth that you deserved every bit of this."

With those final words, Myron didn't spare another glance at Brandon. He turned sharply and climbed into the waiting car.
Facing Millie, his expression softened into a comforting smile. "Come on. Let's get you home."

Myron fired up the Bentley, swiftly guiding the car away until its lights vanished into the dark horizon.

Several long moments passed before Myron's men finally released theif grip on Brandon.

Instantly, Brandon lunged toward his own vehicle to pursue them, only to be met again by an immovable blockade of Myron's men.

"Don't waste your time, Mr. Watson," one man said firmly. "Mr. Elliott already anticipated your move.Anywhere Miss Bennett might go, he's made sure you're not welcome. My suggestion is to take a moment to collect yourself."

The words barely registered with Brandon, blending into a haze of noise as he stormed into his car and sped off.


...

Meanwhile, the Bentley sliced through the night air, smoothly cutting along empty streets.

Millie and Myron sat in silence.

An awkward stillness filled the space between them.

Only when the traffic light ahead flashed red did Myron gently bring the car to a stop.

In the soft glow from the dashboard, he glanced over at MMillie, opening his mouth briefly but finding himself unable to speak.

He could still feel the lingering heat from Millie's kiss, a warmth that refused to fade, his heartbeat echoing the memory.

His gaze drifted downward, settling on the faint bruising at her wrist where Brandon had grabbed her.

A wave of remorse washed over him.

Earlier she'd assured him she could handle Brandon herself, prompting Myron to stay out of it. He'd trusted that Brandon would at least be gentle with Millie, never anticipating such roughness.

Moved by guilt, he gently took hold of her hand and began soothing her wrist with tender fingers.

Millie met his eyes and exhaled softly.

Just as she opened her mouth to speak, the traffic signaI turned green. Myron gently touched her cheek and murmured, "I can see there's something on your mind. Let's wait until we're back at your apartment,alright?"

Behind them, a horn impatiently blared.

Millie quietly nodded.

The remainder of the drive was silent until the car pulled up outside Millie's apartment building, coming smoothly to rest.

For a moment, neither made a move to leave.

Drawing a steadying breath, Myron finally broke the silence."Listen, about what just happened, if you prefer,we can pretend-"

"I'm completely serious," Millie interjected, halting his words immediately.

Myron turned, startled by the intensity of her gaze.

Millie gave him a faint, resigned smile, silently wondering why no one ever seemed to take her sincerity at face value.

"I didn't do it to spite Brandon or anything," Millie explained softly. "If I did, your lips wouldn't have been involved.You should understand that I made up my mind back in your art studio, but you insisted I consider carefully before giving you my answer. And my answer won't change-even if you asked me again tomorrow morning."

Millie's brows drew together slightly as she searched Myron's gaze.

"Unless," she said tentatively, her eyes probing his expresson, "you've reconsidered?"
"Absolutely not," Myron answered without hesitation. "Millie, I'm crazy about you. Pve been counting the seconds until you'd finally agree."

The words tumbled from him swiftly, as though pausing might invite her doubt.

It all seemed impossibly perfect, and he somehow feared it might simply be a dream he didn't wanf to wake up from.

A laugh bubbled softly from Millie's lips.

He realized at once she'd been teasing him deliberately.

A grin spread across Myron's face as he playfully reached out, pinching her gently on the cheek.

Millie cast him a mock glare.

Yet Myron's hand remained, shifting to cradle her face tenderly instead.

The quiet click of his seatbelt releasing filled thebrief silence.

Slowly,Myron leaned toward her,closing the gap inch by inch.

Her lips hovered tantalizingly close, her gentle breath mingling with his own, the soft sweep of her eyelashes clearly visible.

This proximity set his pulse racing wildly, and with a slight rasp betraying his anticipation, he whispered,"Would you let me kiss you?"
###Chapter 206 The Wedding Ring He'd Placed On Her Finger


"Can I kiss you?" Myron asked again.

Millie's heart pounded.

His hand still rested on her face. She could feel the warmth of his palm and the soft brush of his breath against her cheek.

She lifted her eyes to his.

"Yes," she whispered.

Before the word had fully left her lips, his mouth found hers.

His breath mingled with hers as their hearts seemed to beat in sync.

That was the moment Brandon arrived.

From where he stood, he saw Millie in the passenger seat. Myron leaned over her, lost in a kiss.

Her hand rested lightly on Myron's shoulder. Her slender arm stood in sharp contrast to his broad frame.

Brandon's eyes widened. Rage surged in him.

He stepped out of the car but was stopped at once. Myron's security team held him back and quickly pulled him away.

They also took his Maybach.

Back in the Bentley, Myron had already let Millie go.

She leaned into him, catching her breath, her hand still on his shoulder and her forehead resting against his chest.

Myron let out a soft chuckle. The sound vibrated through his chest, making her cheeks burn hotter.
He noticed the change in her and gently stroked her häir, and then patted her back.

"Millie,I really like you like this," he murmured. His voice was low and rough.

The kiss earlier outside his house had been a briëf touch. This one was their first real kiss.

He had held back, unsure if she wás ready.

Now he felt sure. She meant it. She wasn't doing this just to spite Brandon

The thought filled him with excitement.

1f he couuld skip to their wedding day, he would. But he knew he had to hold back and be patient.

At least now,they were truly together.

After a moment, Millie gave him a playful shove. Myron smiled and leaned back, releasing her.

"I need to go home," she said softly.

"Okay," he replied.

Before she could say anything more, he added, "Sorry I can't walk you up today."

She paused, confused for a second. Then her cheeks flushed with understanding.

She pushed him back into his seat and gave a small, teasing snort.

Without another word, she unbuckled her seatbelt, picked up her bag, and stepped out.

Just before heading into the building, she leaned back toward him.、"Drive safe,"she said.

He nodded, smiling. "Goodnight."

"Goodnight," she replied, then turned and walked away.

He stayed parked until he saw the lights in her apartment turn on. She stepped out onto the balcony and waved. Only then did he flash the car lights in reply and drive off.

As the Bentley passed Brandon and his Maybach, Myron glanced toward him coldly. He didn't say a word as he sped away.

Brandon stood motionless. His rágë burned, but beneath it was something worse-helplessness.

Everything was falling apart.

He could convince himself that the kiss outside the Elliott Mansion might have beert Millie's way to spite him. But the one she shared with Myron in the car just now had been real.

She had truly let go of him.

She had truly started over.

Brandon couldn't lie to himself anymore.

His chest ached. The world around him seemed to collapse.

"Let me go," Brandon said.

Myron's men still held him.

"I won't go to her," he said.

He had seen them. Myron had guards posted at the entrance of the apartment building.

Only then did they release him.

Brandon got back into his car: A strong urge rose in him to tell Millie everything. But the memory of that day came rushing back, and he bit it back.

He turned the car around and drove.

The Maybach sped down empty streets, Brandon had no idea where he was headed.

All he felt was the sharp pain in his chest, as if something inside him was cracking, piece by piece.

Tears ran down his face. He had never cried like this before.
One thought echoed in his mind-"She really left me."

She truly left him.

The truth had never hit so hard.

He felt like he was losing his mind.

When he finally looked up, he realized he had arrived at Serenity Villa. It was the house they moved into after getting married.

Images of their wedding day filled his head. Her white dress. Her smile. The way her eyes had seen only him.

He stepped out and walked into the villa.

The light switch clicked under his fingers.

But the house was empty.

Everything she had picked out was gone. Only his things remained.

Brandon closed his eyes, as if doing so could stop the pain.

Memories of their wedding night returned. They had come back here while the others stayed behind. He had carried her inside and then set her on the kitchen counter.

"Want a drink?" he had asked with a grin.

"Sure," she had said, smiling at him.

He had opened the fridge, pulled out the bubbly champagne, and poured her a glass.

She had taken it, laughing, and sipped. Brandon had then kissed her, tasting the champagne from her lips.

Now,Brandon walked into the kitchen. He opened the fridge. Only his beers remained.

He closed it and made his way to the bedroom.
That night, she had teased him with playful hits, but he had carried her all the way here.

The bedroom light flicked on.

It had been empty for a long time.

He lay down on the bed. Alone now. Staring up at the blank ceiling.

Tears slipped down his face again. Then a new fear gripped him.

If she married Myron,would she do everything with him,too?

His chesttightened. His breath grew shallow. Panic surged.

1t took time to calm down, and when he did, he felt drained.

The pain had dulled into something heavy.

He wiped the tears from his eyes and leaned back against the headboard.

His gaze landed on the bedside lamp. He turned it on. Then, slowly, he opened the drawer. Inside,something caught his eye.

He frowned and reached in.

The first thing he pulled out was a small perfume bottle he had given her.

He removed the cap and sprayed a little into the air. The scent still clung to her memory.

His chest ached.

He closed his eyes and set the bottle on the nightstand.

There was more in the drawer. He reached in again and found something small and round.

He lifted it into the light. It was her wedding ring. The one he had placed on her finger.

Under the glow of the lamp, it shimmered with a cold, metallic gleam.
###Chapter 207 Brandon's Disappearance


Brandon stared at the ring in disbelief, struggling to process what had just unfolded as he rested against the headboard.

A sharp pain suddenly twisted his stomach, and he found himself coughing blood right onto the wedding band.

His thoughts scattered, and almost instinctively, he tried to clean the ring, yet the red mark refused to fade.

The pain finally caught up with him, and while his body ached, his eyes drifted from the stained ring in his palm back to the bottle of perfume on the nightstand. Defeated, he shut his eyes, weighed down by misery.


...

Millie spent the evening by herself.

Once Myron and Brandon were gone, she settled into the recliner on the balcony, wrapped in the solitude of her empty home.

The night air felt cool against her skin.

She still wore the blue heart-shaped pendant around her neck.

Her fingers closed around the pendant as she recalled everything that had unfolded that day.

She remembered how Myron had looked at her, so open and sincere, and she couldn't forget the way Brandon had treated her, either.

Whatever battles Brandon was facing, she couldn't claim to understand them, but it was clear that their relationship could never return to what it once was.

All she could do now was build a future with Myron, Ari, and perhaps someday invite her mother into that picture,too.

 Because Nicole held the legal role as Ari's adoptive mother, Millie was considered only a supporting guardian. Any official paperwork, including hospital records, would always name Nicole as Ari's mother to reflect her full legal responsibility.

From that point on, all future check-ins wvith the adoptive family would have to involve Nicole as well.

For this reason, Millie needed to make sure her mother stayed close

They didn't talk much, but with time, things between them-were starting fto get better.

Her mother...

Millie's gaze drifted to the pendant.

Did her mother ever think about her father these days?

Millie's eyes lowered, thoughtful.

Maybe it was only natural for old memories to fade; so many years had passed since her father left their lives.

It would be unfair to expect her mother to hold onto those memories forever.

Millie thought as long as she kept those moments alive in her own heart, that was enough.

And maybe, just maybe, Myron carried those memories with him as well.

That small hope brought a bit of comfort. Knowing there was someone else in the world who missed the same person made Millie feel less alone.


···

The hours crept by.

By morning, chaos had erupted at the Watson Group.

Brandon was nowhere to be found.

Word spread that he'd come down with something, and Derek was handling the company in his absence.

Gossip buzzed through the halls.

"Did you hear? Mr. Watson looked perfectly fine yesterday. What could've happened for him to get sick so suddenly? Maybe he's taken ill because he can't handle how determined Myron has been to win Millie's heart?"

"No one really knows for sure. Isn't he with Vivian these days? Millie's just his ex-wife."

"This kind of thing almost never happens. Even if Mr. Watson was sick before, he'd still manage the company from his bed or run meetings over the phone. But now? He's left everything up in the air."

"Are you serious?"

"Yeah. His grandfather has to step in to handle things for now."

"Oh wow. You don't think Mr. Watson's condition is serious, do you?"

"Let's not jump to scary conclusions."


...

High above in the Watson Group executive suite, Derek sat in his office with Norma nearby.

Eugene arrived to lend a hand with the company's affairs.

Derek looked over to Eugene, his tone quiet but urgent."Any word on how he's doing?"

Eugene answered right away, "Mr. Watson was taken to the hospital last night. After some tests, the doctors said his condition isn't life-threatening. He's just been under too much stress and has been drinking heavily,which made him cough up blood."

"With proper treatment, the doctors expect him to recover in no time," Eugene added, hoping to put Derek and Norma at ease.

Derek acknowledged the update with a small nod.

"Did he mention.what triggered it?" Derek pressed, unable to hide his concern.

Eugene let out a heavy sigh and shook his head.

He'd been trying to get answers ever since the incident, but Brandon stayed silent, only insisting that he wanted to leave the hospital.

Eugene continued, "Mr. Watson wás adamant about being discharged. Right now, he's at Serenity Villa,and I've already arranged for a doctor to monitor his recovery there."

Serenity Villa?

That was the house Brandon once shared with Millie.

Derek and Norma traded a look, each silently acknowledging what the other was thinking.

They chose not to push Eugene any further.

"You can get back to your work now," Derek told him.

"Understood," Eugene said before quietly heading out and closing the office door behind him.

The room was silent, with just Derek and Norma left behind.

Norma finally broke the silence. "Derek, what's your take on all this? Do you think Millie has something to do with it?"

"Humph!" Derek gave a sharp scoff. "Brandon's keeping us in the dark, so your guess is as good as mine.lf this is about Millie, then honestly, he brought it on himself."

Norma hesitated, unsure if she should speak her mind.

After a pause, she went on, "Myron isn't exactly subtle about his feelings for Millie. If she says yes to him..."

Derek's eyes met Norma's, but he found no words, and a heavy silence settled over them once more.

Time slipped by until Derek finally exhaled, sounding weary."A∥we can do now is hope Brandon wakes up to his own mistakes. If he keeps refusing to change, my hands are tied."

Norma gave a quiet nod,agreeing with him.

Within the halls of Watson Group, most employees figured Brandon would bounce back in a day or two. At the very least, they expected a quick update or a virtual meeting.

But nothing happened.

Day after day went by, four in total, without a single message from Brandon.

Derek kept reassuring everyone that Brandon was just taking time to recover, while Eugene provided the shareholders with medical records to back up their claims. Still, uneasiness crept in.

"If he's really okay, then why not check in with us, even just through a video call or a message on the company platform?"

"What if his condition is actually much worse than they're letting on?"

"Honestly, if something happens to Mr. Watson, who's going to lead us? He's the one who turned this comnpany around."


···

Watson Group's stock price began to waver, reflecting the growing uncertainty.

Even after countless statements and making Brandon's medical records public, whispers of fake documents continued to spread.

On the fifth day of Brandon's absence, Millie was at the Elliott Group's jewelry store reviewing new merchandise when a crowd of reporters suddenly surrounded her, clearly waiting for this moment.

They wasted no time, shouting questions all at once.

"Miss Bennett, do you have any idea where Mr. Watson has been these last few days?"

"Miss Bennett, is it true that Mr. Watson's illness has something to do with you?"

"Have you visited Mr. Watson at all, Miss Bennett? How's his condition now? Can you give us an update on his condition?"

Although security quickly stepped in to pull the reporters away from Millie, plenty of curious eyes still followed her every move.

Standing in the middle of the crowd, Millie could feel a dull ache building behind her tempes.

She'd heard about Brandon's heálth scare the very day it happened, but stepping in was never on her agenda.

She had spelled things out for Brandon long before, and that night, she'd only made her feelings more clearer.

Despite her efforts to stay out of sight these past few days, even going so far as to disguise herself, she stilf couldn't avoid the reporters who seemed to be everywhere.

Millie realized that staying silent would only invite more chaos and attention.

The pendant rested coolly against her chest beneath her blouse, its touch somehow soothing her nerves.

She knew it was time to face the press and make her position clear.
###Chapter 208 | Saw Them Kissing


The thought struck Millie as she watched the sea of reporters surge against the bodyguards' protective barrier.

Some thrust their phones forward, capturing every moment in.réal-time streams, while others worked their cameras with relentless precision.

The metallic symphony of shutters created an endless percussion that filled the air.

"Everyone." Millie's voice cut through the mayhem, and silence descended instantly as every face turned toward her with hungry anticipation.

She acknowledged their presence with a graceful bow, her movements deliberate and respectful, and then lifted her chin with quiet dignity. "I recognize your interest in this matter, but I must clarify something important-Brandon and I have legally ended our marriage."

Her eyes swept across the sea of expectant faces, each word delivered with crystalline clarity that left no room for misinterpretation.

A measured pauseallowed her statement to settle before she pressed forward. "This represents a complete legal dissolution-we possess the official divorce documentation, and I harbor absolutely no intentions of rekindling our relationship."

The crowd exploded into animated chatter, voices weaving together in a tapestry of speculation.

As Millie prepared to speak again, someone's call for silence rippled through the gathering, restoring order.

"While Brandon and I shared a matrimonial bond previously, we nowexist as two strangers," Millie declared,her enunciation crisp and uncompromising. "Consequently, his current circumstances neither concern me nor reach my awareness."

"Should you seek information about his well-being, I suggest approaching those who maintain connections with him rather than pursuing me. First, I possess no knowledge to share with you; second, your presence has disrupted the peace of my daily existence; and third, I request that his future troubles never again lead you to my doorstep. That concludes my statement-thank you for your attention." Millie completed her declaration with another deep, respectful bow.

Despite her petite stature, her determination radiated with the force of tempered steel.

Her penetrating gaze made one final sweep across the reporters' éager faces before she pivoted sharply and strode away, her bodyguards forming a protective cocoon aróund her retreating figure.

The moment Millie vanished from sight, pandemonium erupted across the scene.

Reporters juggled multiple devices-some broadcasting live while others captured video footage, and still others snapped rapid-fire photographs, all racing to upload their exclusive content to eager audiences.

"We possess the official divorce documentation, and I harbor absolutely no intentions of rekindling our relationship," and "His personal affairs neither concern me nor reach my awareness"-these powerful declarations transmitted clearly through every live feed.

Millie's unwavering resolve and steel-edged tone resonated with viewers everywhere, creating ripples of sensation across social media.

The persistent rumors suggesting Millie was simply biding her time, waiting for death to claim Vivian before reuniting with Brandon, crumbled into dust with this public declaration.

"This represents her official stance-she has clearly committed to this path without looking back."


···

Meanwhile, public discourse reached a fever pitch across social platforms.

Inside the tranquil walls of Serenity Villa, Brandon absorbed every word of the breaking news coverage.

After enduring days of intensive medical treatment and enforced rest, his physical condition had stabilized considerably, though a profound weariness had settled deep into his bones-one that seemed to emanate from his very soul-prompting him to transfer many responsibilities to Eugene's capable hands.

Brandon gripped his phone tightly, studying the unwavering determination etched across her features as 
she faced the camera's unblinking eye.

She possessed full knowledge of his deteriorating health, yet her eyes held not even a flicker of concern for his well-being.

His gaze dropped toward the floor, uncertainty clouding his ability to interpret his own emotional landscape.

Days of emotional numbness had left him unable to navigate the maze of his inner thoughts with any clarity.

"Buzz." The phone trembled against his palm, announcing another incoming message.

Brandon's eyes flicked toward the screen-Vivian's name appeared once again.

She had launched a relentless campaign of communication attempts throughout the past several days.

However, he felt no inclination to discuss these complicated matters with her, nor did he wish for her to discover the devastating events that had unfolded that fateful night.

Somewhere in the depths of his consciousness, he nurtured a fragile hope that this entire situation resembled an enormous, shimmering soap bubble-one that might preserve the possibility of redemption as long as he refrained from piercing its gossamer surface.

But Millie's public declaration obliterated every fragile hope he had carefully constructed, leaving nothing but scattered fragments of impossible dreams.

"Millie,you have truly eliminated every possible escape route for me,"he whispered into the suffocating silence of his room.

While Brandon remained transfixed by his phone screen, the thunderous sound of approaching footsteps shattered his contemplation.

His brow creased with irritation as he lifted his gaze to witness Egbert bursting through the doorway.

"Egbert?" Brandon's voice carried genuine bewilderment. "How did you manage to breach the security?"

Egbert crossed the room with predatory purpose, his hands seizing Brandon's shoulders before slamming him backward against the ornate headboard with brutal force.

"How I infiltrated this place should be the least of your worries!" Egbert's voice dripped with icy contempt.

He had orchestrated his entry by accompanying the regular delivery staff, slipping past the guards while they focused on their routine tasks.

His rage burned white-hot within him.

That fateful day, when Millie and Myron had soared through the clouds in their hot air balloon, Egbert had arrived mere moments too late and harbored his own resentment toward Myron's persistent pursuit, yet Egbert had never descended into the desperate madness that now consumed Brandon completely.

"Do you possess even a shred of concern for your company's welfare or not?" Egbert launched his accusation with devastating directness.

"What exactly are you implying?" Brandon's confusion deepened as he struggled to comprehend the sudden attack.

Egbert's rage intensified as he processed Brandon's apparent ignorance.

He thrust an accusing finger toward Brandon's face and delivered his words like poisoned arrows."While you've been wallowing in self-pity within these walls, your company has become a breeding ground for malicious gossip, and hordes of journalists have been tormenting Millie relentlessly!"

Brandon remained largely oblivious to the external chaos his absence had created.

He had delegated all responsibilities to Eugene's capable hands and submitted his medical documentation to appease the shareholders' concerns.

His attention had deliberately avoided broader news coverage, instead focusing exclusively on any mentions of Millie's name while systematically ignoring everything else that might disturb his fragile equilibrium.

"I will address the situation immediately," Brandon responded with measured calm,already formulating plans to provide the necessary public explanations.

Egbert's fury intensified exponentially at Brandon's dismissive and detached response to the mounting crisis.

"What exactly have you been accomplishing during this pathetic retreat from reality?!" Egbert roared with unbridled fury.

Brandon simply maintained his steady gaze upon Egbert's enraged features.

His mind drifted back to those pivotal moments that had unfolded in Flesta, and he found himself wondering whether having conceived a child with Millie might have fundamentally altered the trajectory of their current catastrophe.

"Answer me this instant!" Egbert's fist trembled with barely restrained violence, poised to strike.

At that precise moment, the villa's staff members rushed toward the confrontation, ready to inform Brandon about the security breach that had occurred.

Brandon dismissed their concerns with a casual wave of his hand, signaling his complete awareness of the situation.

Then Brandon's attention returned to Egbert with calculated deliberation.

"She has chosen to be with Myron now." The words emerged after an extended silence, each syllable weighted with resignation.

"What did you just say?" Egbert questioned his hearing capacity. Weren't they simply enjoying a recreational hot air balloon excursion together?

Wasn't Myron still locked in the pursuit phase of their courtship?

Observing the momentary shock that flickered across Egbert's expression, Brandon experienced a twisted sense of vindictive pleasure.

"I'm sharing the unvarnished truth with you,"Brandon continued, savoring every nuance of Egbert's bewildered expression. "She made her declaration directly in front of me, and furthermore..."

Brandon allowed the suspense to build deliberately before delivering the final blow. "She pressed her lips against Myron's right before my very eyes."

"That's absolutely impossible!" Egbert's eyes expanded to their physical limits, disbelief written across every line of his face.

In the next heartbeat, he clamped his hands around Brandon's shoulders with crushing intensity, boring into his eyes as though searching for any microscopic traces of deception or fabrication.

But Brandon's eyes contained nothing except the

raw honesty of profound anguish.

"I saw it with my own two eyes," Brandon continued his torturous narrative. "She appeared to be completely enamored with his presence."

Egbert fixed Brandon with a murderous glare.

"Smack!" Egbert's palm connected with Brandon's cheek in a resounding slap that echoed through the room.

"You orchestrated this revelation deliberately! There was absolutely no necessity to torture me with such excruciating detail!" Egbert's eyes had transformed into pools of crimson rage.

Brandon released a laugh devoid of any genuine mirth, his fingers dabbing away the crimson trail that Egbert's violence had drawn from the corner of his mouth."If I had omitted any specific detail, how could I have possibly convinced you of the reality?"

He gazed directly into Egbert's blazing eyes, recognizing a perfect reflection of his tormented state from that nightmarish evening, and discovered a perverse sense of vindication in sharing his torment.

"Enough!" Egbert shoved Brandon aside with disgus and began pacing frantically around the room's perimeter, his mind racing to process this devastating information.

"Egbert." Brandon's voice suddenly pierced the tension-filled atmosphere.

"What now?" Egbert snapped with barely contained hostility.

"That day in Flesta." Brandon's question emerged laden with overwhelming sorrow. "What transpired during those crucial ten minutes when I was absent from the scene?"
Egbert studied Brandon's battered form slumped against the headboard, blood still trickling from his wounded mouth, and allowed himself a moment of contemplation. He concluded that the time had finally arrived for Brandon to confront certain uncomfortable truths.
###Chapter 209 Wasn't She Experiencing Even The Faintest Tremor Of Fear


Egbert's eyes tracked Brandon's labored movements as he struggled to rise, melancholy flooding through him like a cold tide.

"Do you happen to have any wine?" Egbert's voice carried a quiet desperation.

Brandon chose silence over words, his hand reaching instead for the ornate bedside bell that gleamed in the afternoon light.

Within moments, soft footsteps announced the arrival of a uniformed maid. "Yes, Mr. Watson?"

"Please retrieve several bottles from our wine collection," Brandon commanded, his hand still dabbing at the crimson streak that continued to seep from his split lip. "You'll find them stored within the wine cellar's depths."

Egbert's gaze shifted to the maid as he rattled off specific vintages, each name rolling off his tongue with practiced precision.

She nodded respectfully toward Brandon before disappearing to fulfill the request.

Egbert studied Brandon's repetitive motions as he continued blotting his wounded mouth with the back of his hand, and with undisguised contempt, he launched a tissue packet from the nearby table in Brandon's direction.

Heavy silence enveloped them both as they waited for the wine's arrival.

Egbert's gaze drifted toward the expansive floor-to-ceiling windows, where he found himself captivated by the garden's breathtaking panorama stretching beyond the glass.

The scenery proved quite breathtaking in its serene beauty.

His mind inevitably wandered to the knowledge that this magnificent residence had been Millie and Brandon's new home to celebrate their marriage, and bitter resentment began gnawing at his consciousness.

Why did fate decree that both Brandon and Myron could claim positions beside her, while denying him the same privilege?

The weight of that injustice settled heavily upon his splrit, crushing him beneath its unbearable burden.

The maid reappeared bearing the requested wine bottles before quietly withdrawing from their presence.

Egbert seized his glass and took a substantial gulp of the rich red wine before finally speaking again."Following your return from Flesta that year, how much time elapsed before she achieved recovery?"

Brandon's eyelids drooped slightly as his mind conjured the harrowing events from that period-vivid images of Millie drenched in her blood, her anguished screams echoing through his mind. The recollection stabbed through his chest with renewed agony.

"More than a month elapsed," Brandon finally managed to whisper. "From that moment forward, her physical condition never truly recovered its former strength."

Egbert acknowledged this revelation with a solemn nod and lifted his glass for another substantial drink.

The chamber remained cloaked in oppressive quiet until Egbert shattered the stillness once more. "You should understand that originally, that crucial contract was never intended to receive my signature."

Brandon's eyebrows drew together in a fierce scowl, his penetrating stare boring into Egbert with unmistakable menace radiating from his expression.

Egbert deliberately dismissed Brandon's intimidating glare and poured himself another generous glass of wine.

"You've undoubtedly heard stories about my previous disposition and business practices," he continued."Even if Watson Group managed to overcome every technical obstacle, what genuine impact could that achievement have made? Even if you had discovered alternative partnership opportunities, globally recognized innovation flows exclusively from my organization. Every other company operates as nothing more than amateur competition. What logical reason existed for my thriving empire to surrender valuable profits to Watson Group, which functioned as little more than an ambitious startup venture at that time?"

Egbert's lips curved into a contemptuous smile as he swirled the burgundy wine wíthin his glass, the liquid's crimson hue evoking memories of her bloodstained form from that devastating day.

"Countless people fail to grasp this fundamental business principle, desperately attempting to extract valuable concessions from me through collaboration, elaborate deception, or various other manipulative methods. Brandon, you proved no different from the rest. Your Vision focused on achieving mutually beneficial cooperation, but I, along with the formidable Perez family empire supporting my decisions,pursued complete monopolistic control. Why would I willingly share profits when I possessed the capability to claim everything for myself? Therefore, when you departed with my assistant to print and finalize the contractual documents, 1 told Millie the truth directly."

Egbert lifted his gaze to study Brandon, whose features had twisted into an expression of profound inner chaos. "Nevertheless, she appeared to have predicted my eleventh-hour sabotage with remarkable accuracy. Yet, despite her foresight, her final decision materialized almost instantaneously."

Egbert consumed another measured portion of wine, his focus dissolving into distant memories as his mind transported him back to that frigid late autumn afternoon in Flesta, years buried in the past.

On that particular day, beside the frozen pool's edge, only Millie and he remained present, accompanied by a substantial gathering of his armed men.

The legal frameworks governing the two nations differed dramatically, and during that era, his personnel carried an impressive arsenal of weapons, their clothing still bearing the dark stains of recent violence.

Brandon and Millie had positioned their own bodyguards fifty meters away to demonstrate their absolute commitment to good faith negotiations, leaving her exposed in a position of complete vulnerability.

Under these deliberately intimidating circumstances, he unveiled his true intentions to her and commanded his armed men to apply psychological pressure.

This represented his customary perverted entertainment-manipulating vulnerable individuals while savoring the expressions of rage and terror that would inevitably cross their faces.

Indeed,he had always been such a fundamentally warped individual.

But she responded with nothing more than a gentle smile, and against the backdrop of that harsh autumn wind, her exporession radiated extraordinary beauty-resembling the single splash of vivid color amid an otherwise colorless landscape.

"Mr. Perez, you've prepared two separate contracts for this meeting, haven't you?" she inquired with perfect composure

He couldn't decipher the meaning behind her words and gestured with his hand for her to élaborate further.

"One contract represents the finalized agreement we've spént hours negotiating and réfining together. The second contract embodies the document you crafted specifically to manipulate and deceive us." Millie allowed her gaze to drop slightly, her lengthy eyelashes creating delicate upward curves that enhanced her refined features. "I suspect you wouldn't want to miss witnessing Brandon's reaction when your elaborate deception achieved its intended effect, so you would have instructed your assistant to print both versions of the contract and bring them to this meeting."

During that tense moment, she smiled directly at him while articulating his elaborate scheme with perfect accuracy and insight.

He craved the satisfaction of observing their faces when the victims realized they'd been thoroughly manipulated. Without witnessing their devastation personally, where would the pleasure reside?

"Therefore..." Her expression maintained that perfectly calibrated smile, betraying not the slightest hint of panic or distress. She continued with maddening composure, "Mr. Perez, let's establish a wager between us."

This unexpected turn caught him completely off guard, since he had always been the one to initiate such dangerous propositions.

His standard procedure followed a predictable pattern-the opposing party would engage in lengthy negotiations with him, and then depart with jubilant expressions to finalze the contract printing, only to return and discover they had been thoroughly deceived, their faces contorting with raw fury. At that precise moment, Egbert would extend what appeared to be a lifeline through a high-stakes wager, rekindling their desperate hope, and they would inevitably accept his gambling challenge.

Subsequently, when they inevitably lost the wager, he would cast them out like mangy dogs without ceremony.

However, if they somehow managed to win, the entertainment reached even more exquisite heights--Egbert would tear the contract to shreds directly before their eyes,declaring with mock surprise,"What a delightful twist, wouldn't you agree?"

Witnessing their expressions during that crushing moment of revelation brought him pure, intoxicating pleasure.

The aftermath proved equally satisfying-after banishing them from his presence and later hearing others recount tales of his "legendary exploits," Egbert discovered even deeper gratification in hís reputation.

But this encounter had shattered his carefully orchestrated routine entirely.

He studied her with renewed interest before asking, "Indeed? What manner of wager captures your imagination?"

Her smile remained unwavering as she responded, "This represents your territory, Mr. Perez. Since I've initiated this proposal, you possess the authority to establish the terms. I can only express that should I emerge victorious, I hope you would honor the cooperation agreement we've just completed."

His eyebrow arched upward as a malevolent grin spread across his features, and he declared, "Then let's wager our very lives. Do you possess such courage?"

He elevated his right hand with deliberate menace, raising the weapon clutched within his grip, its obsidian barrel aimed directly at her chest.

Around him, a dozen of his most ruthless enforcers-seasoned criminals every one-simultaneously raised their firearms and targeted her vulnerable form.

This location was Flesta, a region notorious for its permissive weapon regulations, so these represented genuine military-grade firearms, their metal surfaces carrying the acrid tang of fresh gunpowder.

If he or any of his subordinates applied pressure to their triggers, her skull would detonate like a ripe melon.

"Consider your options with extreme care. Should you stop right here, the worst outcome involves an unsigned contract. But should you go on and lose this gamble, you forfeit your existence. Precisely like this..."

"Bang!" He pantomimed the sound of a gunshot with his free hand, his grin widening as he performed the explosive sound effect with theatrical flair.

Yet she displayed not the slightest trace of terror-her eyes never wávered from the dozen weapon muzzles trained upon her position.

She simply inclined her head in calm acceptance and stated, "Very well, let's stake our lives on this outcome."

Her demeanor suggested complete indifference to the presence of those lethal weapons, as though she faced nothing more threatening than an ordinary business discussion.

Only at that moment did he begin to scrutinize the woman standing before him with genuine attention.

Although her maneuvering during their earlier negotiations had demonstrated remarkable brilliance, he had never intended to honor the contract regardless, so her tactical prowess hadn't concerned him particularly.

But now, with her very existence balanced precariously in his hands, a troubling question emerged.

Wasn't she experiencing even the faintest tremor of fear?
###Chapter 210 | Bet On My Win


Egbert was stil 1ost in thought when her voice cut through the silence.

"Wagering lives alone feels too dul," Millie said lightly, almost playfully. "Mr. Perez, F'm sure you've played this game more times than you can count. Let's make it more intéresting."

Just when he thought she was no different from the rest, she added something unexpected."Let's gamble on something real. Let's see if anyone in this room is willing to die for someone else-completely selflessly."

Her words hung in the air, defining the purity of what was at stake.

At the time, Egbert didn't fully grasp what she meant. To him, it seemed like a challenge he could easily win.His men had been by his side for years. They had proven their loyalty time and again. Surely, any one of them would be willing to lay down his life for him.

So he agreed. "Alright," he said confidently.

Then he saw her smile-a knowing expression that sent an unexpected chill through him. Her eyes slowly scanned the faces of his assembled men, studying each one with careful attention.

"That's good," she continued, her tone growing more serious. "But once this person takes action, Mr. Perez,you cannot offer him any compensation whatsoever. Not money for his family, not promises to take care of his loved ones, not even a word of gratitude afterward. Nothing at all."

Before he could fully grasp her intent, she moved to the heart of the matter.

"Mr. Perez, I'm willing to give up my life for Brandon,"she said, her voice clear and calm. "Now, who among your people is willing to give up their life for you?"

Her gaze shifted back to him, penetrating and direct."Tell me-who among your men would die for you without expecting anything in return?"

Egbert turned slowly to look at his men. But this time, he didn't see the loyalty he'd always assumed was there. He saw fear. Uncertainty. Silent hesitation.

When he faced Millie again, that same infuriating smile was still on her face, sweet and calm, as if she already knew the answer.

Rage rose in his chest. He sprang to his feet, marched toward her, and shoved the barref of his gun against her forehead. "Don't play games with me,"he growled. "Didn't you'say you'd die for Brandon? Want me to help you fulfill that promise right now?"

He wasn't bluffing. He hadn't planned to keep his word anyway. Killing her now or later made no difference to him. He'd ended many lives before. One more wouldn't matter.

But she simply laughed-a sound filled with something that cut deeper than mockery.

It was pity. Pure, undisguised pity directed at him.

"Oh, Egbert Perez," she said quietly. "People spoke of you long before you ever set foot in Flesta. Ruthless.Wild.Unpredictable. But do you know what I see when I look at you?" She held his gaze."I see a man drowning in tragedy."

Egbert's rage intensified, the cold metal of his weapon digging mercilessly into her temple.

Yet she remained as serene as still water, untouched by the storm of his fury.

"I believe you've been orchestrating elaborate charades," she said with gentle laughter rippling through her voice. "Though these performances are stained crimson with horror and dread. I cannot fathom what treasures you've sacrificed or what demons torment your spirit within. However, I perceive that your celebrated mastery over fate and your reputation for wild unpredictability mask nothing more than a desperate hunt for something-or someone-to heal the gaping wound in your essence. I name this affliction helplessness."

Her voice grew softer, more knowing. "You yearn to shield certain people yet find yourseIf inadequate;you chase dreams that slip through your fingers like smoke, crave another's complete devotion while they merely exploit your vulnerabilities for their own advancement. Thus, you've crafted these elaborate spectacles as outlets for the tempest raging in your chest."
Egbert's memory burned with the white-hot fury that had consumed him in that moment.

His finger had trembled against the trigger, a heartbeat away from releasing the buflet that would scatter her thoughts across the floor.

She had stripped bare his most guarded secrets, laid his wounded soul open to the light, and then dared to regard him with compassion. The truth was unbearable.

Refusing to acknowledge her insight, he twisted his features into a contemptuous sneer, his words dripping with venomous mockery. "And what's the point of all this? Huh? You think you've figured me out? And you-what can you do now? You do realize that even if I shoot you right here, that contract still might not be signed. So what does that make you? Powerless too, right?"

"Hahaha!" Savage laughter erupted from his throat as he gazed down at her with cruel satisfaction."A∥your eloquent speeches, yet they ultimately spring from terror of the grave, don't they? Grovel before me,Millie.Plead for me to preserve your miserable existence so you can flee back to your little Brandon!"

But no entreaties fell from her lips.

She offered no defense, no desperate arguments. Instead, she embraced the truth with startling grace.

"Indeed, I am without strength," she simply acknowledged. "It is precisely because I have walked through that wilderness of helplessness myself that | recognize the landscape of your current torment. I comprehend it entirely."

Millie looked at him, her eyes slightly reddened, yet a faint smile still rested on her lips.

In that single glance, he felt the profound weight of genuine understanding wash over him.

Never before in his existence had anothersoul truly seen through the labyrinth of his inner torment.

Something cracked within his chest-a wall he'd built over decades, crumbling the instant he recognized her complete comprehension of his pain.

"However, Egbert, fortune has smiled upon me in ways it has denied you," she said with quiet grace. "I have someone who loves me. Someone completely devoted to me."
"You mean him?" Egbert's voice carried a note of disbelief as he referenced Brandon.

"Absolutely." Her response rang with unwavering conviction, reflected both in the depths of her gaze and the steady rhythm of her pulse.

"He became my salvation," she continued, her voice soft with reverence. "When death's shadow fell across my path, he pulled me back into the light. When weakness consumed my spirit, he breathed courage into my bones. The most exquisite words he ever spoke weren't declarations of affection, but rather 'You're part of my life plan.!' Egbert, if today you pressed that weapon against his temple and demanded he sacrifice himself for my sake, I know without question he would accept that fate gladly."

She paused, her smile deepening with profound wisdom. "What I wish to share with you is this-if there exists someone you cherish above all else, then pour every fiber of your being into shielding them from harm. Even when success seems impossible, exhaust every avenue available. If there burns within you a dream worth pursuing, then chase it with relentless determination.Drowning in helpless rage bears no fruit whatsoever."

A moment of contemplative silence stretched between them before she added, "That's something I learned...the hard way."

Without thinking, the words slipped from him. "What if I still can't do it?"

Her smile transformed into something luminous and encouraging."Success will find you-provided you drive yourself beyond every perceived limitation."

Her declaration struck him like lightning through his veins-a sudden, electrifying moment of crystal-clear revelation.

They carried the power of profound suggestion, whispering to his wounded soul that victory lay within his grasp.

Before he could formulate another word, she graced him with that radiant smile once more."Don't forget our bet, Egbert. We were betting lives," she said."And I'm betting on my win."

He didn't even have time to respond. In the next second, Millie stepped forward and jumped into the freezing pool beside them.
Egbert stood frozen, completely stunned. His mind stopped working.

He could barely process what had just happened.

"Success will find you-provided you drive yourself beyond every perceived limitation."

Through her audacious leap, she demonstrated the true meaning behind those words.

The pool water was like ice. It was late autumn. Prolonged exposure would invite hypothermia's deadly embrace, and before long, it would claim her life entirely.

Even survival would guarantee severe illness and lasting damage.

But that wasn't the worst part. As she floated there, shivering, her lips turning blue, something else happened. Blood. Red bloomed in the water around her, dark and shocking.

In that moment,bewilderment consumed him entirely. Why was there blood?

No visible wounds marred her skin; no bullets had found their mark.

Perhaps the ice had torn her flesh with razor-sharp edges?

Her expression mirrored his confusion-until sudden understanding dawned across her features, and she seemed to grasp a terrible truth he could not yet fathom.
###Chapter 211 That's Your Goodnight Kiss


All at once, chaos broke the silence.

"Millie!" called out someone in distress.

Brandon strode in at that very moment. Egbert's assistant followed close behind, the newly-printed contract in hand.

Without giving himself a second thought, Brandon plunged straight into the cold depths of the pool.

With quick hands, he pulled Millie from the freezing water.

Crimson swirled through the pool, her blood staining Brandon as he struggled to hold her steady.

Everyone in the room stood frozen. The shock and fear were plain on every face.

Upstairs, the calm of Serenity Villa's bedroom offered a sharp contrast.

Egbert looked at Brandon and said, "You want to know what went down after you left? Now you know."

A row of empty bottles hinted at how much Egbert had been drinking, and there was a glazed look in his eyes.

Raising his head, Egbert fixed his gaze on Brandon, who seemed close to breaking down, his eyes rimmed with red.

A bitter laugh escaped Egbert.

"Believe me, it's not a complicated storsaid Egbert, furrowing his brow. The sunlight pouring through the window set his eyes aglow with a strange,red light.

"She put her trust in you, loved you more than you know, and risked everything for your sake. Does any of that mean anything to you?" asked Egbert. The wind lifted his hair as he continued,"After you saved her from the water that day, the first thing she did was to remind me to sign the contract. She truly cared about you."

A sudden crash shattered the air.

The next instant, Brandon launched himself from the bed, grabbed Egbert by the collar, and drove him hard into the white wall.

Glasses and bottles went tumbling, red wine pooling across the floor like spilled blood.

That dark stain brought back the memory of Millie's endless bleeding.

Echoes of her laughter and the sound of her broken sobs lingered in their thoughts.

Brandon's face twisted with pain, and tears threatened to spill from his eyes.

However, Egbert's only response was a sharp, mocking laugh.

Egbert leaned forward and said, "She got that clever edge from her father. Maybe she learned it, or maybe it's just in her blood. She's sharp and strong-willed. When it comes to herself, she doesn't hold back. You should know that by now." He shook his head. "She planned everything, except for the baby. That surprised us all. From the very start, she decided her own safety didn't matter. She knew I'd likely rip up the contract,so she didn't wait. She proposed a wager first. I set the rules, but she never let go of control. Deep down,she knew even if she won, I would not keep my promise, so she kept pushing until I could not think straight.We risked everything that day. I bet she noticed the pool the moment I pressed my gun against her head.She made that choice. For her, a chance in the water was better than a bullet from me."⑤

Since Brandon had been there for everything, he understood exactly what Egbert meant.

Millie had begun weaving her plan the instant Egbert started making threats.

With every word she spoke, she'd already decided she'd put everything on the table.

"Still, nobody knew she was carrying your child then. Not you. Not her."

"Shut up!" Brandon could not hold back anymore. He swung and hit Egbert hard on the jaw.

Egbert didn't back down. He swung right back, his fist connecting with Brandon's face.

The two men crashed into each other, trading blows with raw fury.

All the commotion brought people running, and soon, hands were grabbing at their arms, pulling them apart.

Egbert wiped the blood from his mouth and spat on the floor. "Youhave no right to be mad here! While you stand there, remember this-she would've died for you without a second thought. She might plan every move, but my gun was loaded and pointed straight at her head. And what do you do now? Treat her like she's nothing, all because of another woman? You're the one who failed her!"

Brandon's face twisted in pain, words dying on his lips. Instead, he shut his eyes and let the guilt wash over him.

"Myron has her now," Brandon said, his tone heavy with sorrow."She walked away from me."

"You got what was coming to you." Egbert rolled his eyes and then stalked out of the room.

Left alone, Brandon watched in silence as the maid hurried to pick up the shattered glass and mop up the mess.

That dark puddle of red wine clung to the floor, so much like blood that Brandon had to turn away, stung by the memory.


..·

Later that day, Brandon made his entrance at the Watson Group headquarters.

Looking refreshed and healthy, he brushed off concern, telling colleagues that a simple illness had kept him away,but he was already back on his feet.①

Whispers and speculation faded soon after.

When pressed by eager journalists about Millie's recent statement to the public, Brandon simply shut down,giving them nothing to work with.

Days slipped by.

Within the city's elite circles, Vivian stayed in the spotlight, hyping up her debut luxury floral showcase through a livestream event at an elegant villa.

For maximum impact, she timed her livestream to clash with the launch of Elliott Group's newest series-turning the day into a silent rivalry.

Darden had lent his villa to Vivian for her project as Brandon asked. However, Vivian frowned at the option. It just didn't have the wow factor she wanted.

The opening needed to dazzle, so finding the perfect venue became her obsession.

A glint of mischief flickered in her gaze.

At the same time, Millie threw herself into final preparations for the Elliott Group's upcoming event.

This latest collection focused on brilliant yellow gemstones, aptly named the Golden series.

In recent weeks, Millie had juggled between work and Ari's care, grateful for Myron's unwavering support.

With so much time spent together, a quiet bond formed between them.

Once they dropped Ari off that evening, Millie and Myron wandered through familiar streets side by side.

Night after night, they'd found comfort in this samewalk, letting routine knit them closer.

Their fingers intertwined, the two watched their shadows stretch and merge beneath the moon's soft glow.

Conversation flowed easily, and soon talk circled back to the product launch and everything that could go wrong.

When the walk ended, Myron made sure Millie reached her door safely.

Standing at her doorstep, he remarked gently, "The launch is almost here, Millie. Vivian's not the type to back down.Just promise you'll stay alert."

Without hesitation, Millie gave a nod of agreement.

She had barely stepped inside when Myron interjected with a soft laugh, "Hold on, Millie. Don't go in just yet."
"What?" Confusion flashed across Millie's face as she glanced up.

Before she could say another word, Myron swept in, wrapped an arm around her, gently held her cheek,and pressed a kiss to her lips.

Myron grinned and said, "That's your goodnight kiss."

Millie's cheeks turned pink as she playfully tapped his shoulder. She laughed, unable to help herself.

He smiled even wider. "Now I can wish you a real good night."

"You too, Myron." She slipped inside, the smile still on her face as she closed the door.

Myron smiled as he stood there, charmed by her bashful look.

Inside, Millie leaned against the cool wood, fingers brushing her lips. Her heart hammered, and her blush deepened as she replayed that kiss in her mind.

Not far away, the darkness of a neighboring building concealed a silent observer.O

Hidden in shadow, Brandon caught a glimpse of their kiss before he looked away, unable to bear another second.

He realized his hands were shaking as he walked back to his room.

Resting in his drawer, the wedding ring he once put on Millie's finger himself now waited in the dark.

A faint vibration disrupted the silence as his phone lit up with a new message.

After checking the screen, Brandon let out a slow sigh and responded, "Fine. I'll head out to Proidan in a few days."

When dawn broke on the morning of the launch of Elliott Group's Golden series, Brandon boarded a plane.His flight took him straight to Proidan.

Standing at a window, Vivian watched his departure with satisfaction.

"Even fate's on my side," Vivian muttered to herself, a sly glint sparking in her eyes.

###Chapter 212 Rivalry


Minutes dragged on in a slow parade.

By the morning, Millie was already setting the stage for Elliott Group's newest launch event, the Golden series.

Bright sunflowers transformed the street, filling the space with energy and joy as sunlight poured over their bright yellow petals.

Nestled among these blossoms, a delicate pathway curved around a stream of shimmering gold that never stopped flowing.

Designers had outdone themselves with that thoughtful detail.

Cameras clicked as Millie stepped forward, her smile as radiant as the display itself. She greeted the crowd."This river represents time. Some says time slips away like a river, always moving and always changing. But this one flows differently."

Confused expressions rippled through the audience as her words hung in the air.

Eager to clear things up, she continued, "Let's invite some of you to join us, and you'll see what I mean."

Millie waved to the staff, who began.selecting volunteers from the crowd.

Excitement quickly bubbled up as someone cried out, "Vivian's just gone live!"

Another voice called, "Where is she right now?"

Someone else chimed in, "Look at that place! That villa is stunning!"

A slight frown crossed Millie's face as she glanced toward the uproar.

Vivian was supposed to be lying low, claiming she needed time to rest before her big broadcast debut.

Despite that, Charles had mentioned to Millie that Vivian's first stream would take place at Darden's villa.

Millie had come to know Darden fairly well over the years since he was one of Brandon's close fríends. Also,there was a shop assistant at Elliott Group's store named Alyssa Hammond, who people said used to date him.

That was right-Alyssa and Darden had broken up.

Not long ago, Millie had watched Alyssa stand her ground against Darden during a heated exchange.

She still admired how Alyssa handled the situation.

"But hang on, wasn't Vivian supposed to stream from Darden's villa? This doesn't look like it. Isn't this Brandon's place?" someone wondered aloud.

Millie's thoughts scattered as a different voice piped up., this isn't Darden's. That looks exactly like the house Millie and Brandon moved into after they tied the knot!"

"Are you serious?"

The shock was clear.

A hush fell as everyone turned their attention to Millie,who was at the heart of the launch event and the mind behind the new product.

The surprise wasn't limited to the people present. Online viewers began buzzing too, flooding the chat with questions and comments.

Social media platforms erupted with gossip.

Instead of the expected venue, Vivian had chosen an extravagant mansion tucked away in the hills for her live broadcast.

Luxury was everywhere in that villa-a sprawling courtyard, high on the hillside, offering a breathtaking view of the city's twinkling lghts at night.

It did not take long for eagle-eyed viewers to figure out exactly where she was.

As soon as Vivian stepped inside, cameras caught a glimpse of Millie and Brandon's wedding portrait displayed proudly on the far wall.

That alone settled any doubts.

"Unbelievable, she's really there!"

"How did Vivian manage to get into that house?"

"Picture this: while Millie leads another Elliott Group's major product launch event, Vivian's over here streaming her first luxury flower showcase inside Millie and Brandon's home!"

"Who let her through the door? Was it Brandon himself?"

"If Brandon truly cared about Millie, why would he let Vivian do this and even leave their wedding photo up for the world to see?"

"This drama is too good, I have to see Millie's reaction."

Word spread like wildfire, and Eugene was alerted almost immediately.

Within moments, Derek called Eugene into the office.

"Eugene, what's going on over there?!" Derek's words came out sharp with anger.

Caught off guard, Eugene replied, "Mr. Watson, I'm stilI looking into it. Miss Simpson was supposed to be streaming from Darden's place. Somehow, it's ended up at Serenity Villa."

"I want answers now! And get Vivian out of that house,right away!"

Derek's rage was written all over his face, cheeks turning crimson.

Calls to Brandon went unanswered.

Eugene did his best to explain,"Mr. Watson left for Proidan at the crack of dawn to handle a work emergency. I think he's still dealing with that mess, so he probably doesn't have cell service."

Maybe the poor signal out there was why Brandon hadn't picked up.

Derek snapped,∵Gt Darden on the phone, right now!"
"Right away!"

Several rings later,Darden finally picked up.

Hangover still lingering, he shuffled groggily toward the bathroom, completely oblivious to the chaos that had erupted.

"Huh? What's going on?" He swayed with each step, fumbling his way toward the bathroom as if the floor shifted beneath him. "Yeah, Brandon told me Vivian would use my place for her stream. She didn't show up?Where did she end up? Wait, she's at Brandon and Millie's house? This is a disaster!"

Sudden panic wiped away Darden's drowsiness. He splashed water on his face, threw on his clothes, and dashed outside in a rush.

Phone pressed to his ear, he called his villa staff while running to his car.

"Somebody tell me what's going on over there!" Darden yelled.

One of his employees answered right away,"Mr. Harris, we had a busted pipe. Water flooded the whole villa.
Miss Simpson's crew said the broadcast couldn't go forward, so everyoneleft."

Relief gave way to exasperation.

"Unbelievable!" Darden murmured.

Ending the call, Darden jumped behind the wheel and tore off in the direction of Serenity Villa.


···

On the Internet, the story only gained momnentum. Back at the Elliott Group event, crowds swelled, and the noise was overwhelming.

Curiosity focused on Millie, who stood right in the thick of the excitement while people crowded closer and snapped photos.

A crowd had their cameras raised, snapping pictures and recording Millie, their eyes fixed on her, waiting to catch every flicker of her reaction. All eyes were locked on Millie, with everyone holding back their laughter, just waiting for the moment she would give them a reason to let it loose.

Rivalry between Millie and Vivian was now the hottest headline, both online and in person.

Comment sections exploded with wild opinions.

Heated debates broke out at the venue as well.

The whole thing was impossible to ignore.

Even as the commotion grew, more and more people converged on the spot, drawn by the drama swirling around Millie.

Just then, a staff member from Elliott Group hurried over as Millie's walkie-talkie crackled with Myron's voice.

"Millie..."

She cut him off."Let me go first, Myron. I already know what's going on with Vivian. I'll take care of the fallout, but before that, I need to ask you something. Is it alright if I bring up that other matter?"

Quietly, she shared her plan with Myron and waited for his answer.

"Of course. Go ahead," Myron replied without hesitation.

"Perfect."

After placing the walkie-talkie aside, Millie turned her full attention to the gathered crowd, a warm smile spreading across her face with not a hint of worry.

A level-headed person knew every story had two sides.

Vivian no doubt believed she had set Millie up for a public fiasco.

What Vivian considered sabotage, Millie recognized as a golden opportunity.

With so many people drawn in by the drama, Millie saw a room full of potential supporters, handed to her on a silver platter by Vivian herself.

"Ladies and gentlemen, since we've gathered such an incredible audience foday,Fdlike fo take this chance to launch a full live broadcast for everyone's enjoyment."

Her words carried easily through the microphone, capturing the crowd's attention.

A giant screen nearby flickered to life, and a staff member quickly passed Millie the livestream gear.

Thinking on her feet was second nature to her.

Vivian might have tried to turn the spotlight on herself, but Millie was ready to shine right alongside her.

"Come with me-let's take a walk through this river of time together."

With a genuine grin, Millie invited everyone to join her, leading them into the shimmering path of the golden river.

Meanwhile,Vivian watched from her own setup, masking her jealousy with a mocking smile.

"Keep playing mysterious, Millie. Your downfall is coming soon!"

A second later, Vivian's own confident smile was projected onto her live stream for all her viewers to see.

"Ladies and gentlemen, our first luxury floral design livestream officially starts now."

Onlookers wasted no time, splitting their screens to watch both broadcasts unfold side by side, eager to compare every moment.
###Chapter 213 Live Stream Showdown


On the left side of the screen was Millie's stream. On the right, Vivian's.

At that moment, Millie walked confidently ahead, leading a select group of visitors into the golden river of time surrounded by sunflowers.

There were about twenty of them, all handpicked by the Elliott Group-some were journalists, some potential buyers, and a few just curious onlookers.

As they stepped into the field, Millie addressed them with a warm smile. "This is where it begins. It's quite the walk, so you can leave anything you don't need in the baskets beside you." She gestured toward the baskets tucked among the flowers.

There were plenty of baskets, enough for everyone to set down their things.

Once they were done, the group followed Millie deeper into the sunflower sea.

The tour began outdoors. Sunlight poured down, making the sunflowers glow with life.

Beneath their feet, the river of petals shimmered with every step, as if it had a pulse of its own.

Every now and then, golden flashes caught the eye-reflections from the sun hitting hidden picture frames

"Wait... What's that?" someone asked, pointing.

Millie looked to her assistant, who quickly stepped forward.

"Ma'am, I'Il show you."

The two walked toward the glint. The sunflowers parted like curtains, revealing a gilded frame. Inside were vintage black-and-white photos, each marked with a year.

"Look-street scenes from 1935."

"It's not just street scenes!"
"These are real-life moments from back then!"

"Look at this one-people actually wore wedding gowns like this in 1935!"

The photos had captured everything-weddings, laughter, daily life. Framed by the golden field and bathed in sunlight, the past didn't feel so far away.

In one wedding photo, the bride held a bouquet of sunflowers.

As a woman admired the images, she didn't notice something hidden in the frames.

Tiny gemstones-sparkling in soft yellow tones-were woven into the design.

Just as she reached the final photo, a hand appeared beside her. It held a sunflower made entirely of gems.

It was Millie.

Smiling, she offered the immortal bloom. Behind her, the old photo of the bride beamed from 1935.

Meanwhile, on Vivian's stream, her assistant focused the camera on her.

For a moment, the screen seemed to freeze.

As Millie's smiling face appeared on one side, Vivian's camera caught the wedding portrait of Millie and Brandon.

The timing couldn't have been more awkward. The frame paused-but then cut to Vivian.

The irony didn't go unnoticed.

Vivian spoke softly, "Today's floral design is part of the artist series." She picked out a few Teddy Bear Sunflowers.

With quick, graceful hands, she arranged them into a small bouquet-simple and elegant.

"Van Gogh's Sunflowers," she said into the lens.

She picked up the vase and nodded at her assistant. The camera panned slowly across the room,catching glimpses of the mansion's decor but always returning to Vivian and her flowers.

They moved from the kitchen to the dining area, and then into the living room.

Vivian stopped beneath a massive wedding portrait-Millie and Brandon's.

She set the sunflower bouquet right below it.

"I think it fits perfectly here. Don't you agree?"

Her voice was soft, almost fragile, but her words carried a sharp sting.

The Internet lit up.

"She's bold! Vivian's going straight for Millie!"

"Where's Millie? Does she know what's happening? Someone on-site, quickly connect with Millie!"

"Vivian, Millie's going live too. Dare to link up with her?"

Vivian's assistant began reading some of the comments out loud.

Viewers urged her to go live with Millie.

Vivian gave a pale smile to the camera.

"If that's what everyone wants... I'll doit. Though I worry it might be a bit much for Millie."

Then she turned to her assistant and nodded. They opened MAillie's live feed and sent a connection request.

"Is this really okay?" she asked quietly, her tone uncertain.

Back on Millie's stream, she was mid-introduction.

Millie explained, "There is a printer here. You can print your favorite photo and leave your address. The Elliott Group will keep it for five years, and then send it back to you."

She pointed to the frames-some hidden in flowers, others stored in a capsule labeled "time mailbox."

Just then, Vivian's connection request popped up. Viewers flooded the screen with comments.

"Accept it! What are you scared of? Vivian's ready-don't back down, Milfie!"

"Come on! We want fireworks!"

Millie stood in the middle of the street. People on nearby balconies shouted down.

"Pick it up, Millie! Don't be a coward!"

With a soft chuckle, Millie reached out and accepted the request.

The screen split-and Millie came face to face with Vivian, who stood beneath her old wedding photo.

"MAillie," Vivian said, her voice dripping with sweetness and spite. "What do you think of my flowers? Van Gogh's Sunflowers. Do they suit the photo? Do you like them?"

Everyone held their breath, waiting for Millie to snap.

She only smiled. "I think they're lovely. A perfect match."

Then she looked past the camera and gave a nod.

"I have a surprise too," Millie said, smiling

Her assistant walked over with a large frame, covered in cloth. Curious eyes followed as the camera zoomed in.Millie pulled the cloth away.

Inside was a perfect replica of her wedding photo with Brandon.

She smiled sweetly. "Miss Simpson, I heard you're quite fond of this wedding photo of mine. So, I had a special copy printed just for you."

"Woah! Didn't see that coming!" The crowd on the balconies roared.

Cheers and laughter rang out.

The moment was electric.
Sunlight caught Millie's face just right.

"I know everyone's been dying to hear about me and my ex-husband. You keep pushing, so fine-l'll give you a story," she said.

She lifted the frame and carried it into the sunflowers.

There, she picked up a flower planter and slammed the photo into it.

Golden light danced across her face as the wedding photo stood among the blooms.

Millie turned to the camera, her eyes bright. "Do you like it?" she asked, echoing Vivian's question with a smile.
###Chapter 214 Rummage Through The Trash I Tossed All You Want


"Wow! That's incredible!"

The crowd inside the venue wasn't the only one left speechless. The online audience exploded with excitement.

Millie hadnever spoken up in public about Brandon and Vivian's affair before, but this marked her first bold response.

It was a face-off, clear and unmistakable.

A showdown playing out live!

"I always thought Millie was someone who'd just stay quiet and take the hit, but now she's standing up with some serious courage!"

"Honestly, I live for this drama. Watching them go head-to-head on camera is pure gold!"

"Millie's fearless! Right here at Elliott Group's event, with Myron chasing after her, she still puts up her wedding photo for all to see. That's bold!"

Social media feeds buzzed with nonstop chatter.

Millie read the comments flying by and listened to live updates throug her earpiece, her eyes sparkling with quiet satisfaction.

If Vivian wanted to stir trouble by live-streaming from Millie and Brandon's old place, Millie was more than ready to turn the tables.

So Vivian loved that wedding photo? Perfect. Millie made sure it was front and center for the world to see.

Facing the camera, Millie flashed a knowing smile and asked, "Vivian, you never answered me. Do you like the display?"

Suddenly,all eyes were on Vivian.

Vivian hesitated and then forced a grin, but it didn't have the same confidence as Millie's.

"It's lovely," Vivian replied, her tone laced with false sweetness. Her eyes shone with a practiced vulnerability as she added, "I just didn't realze you'd held onto that,photo. Maybe Brandon's still onyour mind?"

Millie gave a gentle nod and then replied, "Some people are simply unforgettable."

Seven years together, two children, and every wound he left behind. None of that ever truly faded.

Vivian's confident smile began to crack. She glanced awkwardly at the flowers, leting out a small cough as if to play the part of the innocent, wounded party, hoping viewers would see her as the one being wronged.

After a pause, Vivian changed tactics.where should I go next?"

She let out another delicate cough, milking her role as the "wronged beauty."

"The bathroom? The study?" she mused, dragging out the suspense. Then Vivian tossed out a bolder suggestion, eyes wide and seemingly sincere. "Or should I take everyone on a tour of your bedroom?"

On the surface, Vivian's face stayed sweet, but a flash of defiance glinted in her eyes, like someone fighting to protect what she believed was hers.①

The comment section exploded once more.

Viewers couldn't get enough of the tension between the two as they eagerly waited for Millie's comeback.

But MAillie just answered with a dazzling, unbothered smile.

"Vivian, you've got it all wrong. That used to be our home and our bedroom,but not anymore."

Millie's tone was light, steady, and completely fearless.

"Brandon is my ex-husband. Everything on display today belongs to the past. I'm no longer married to Brandon. That ###Chapter's closed."

Millie took a breath, her smile shining even brighter in the sun's glow.

She followed up with, "He's not mine anymore. Where you go from here, that's all on you."

The message was clear. "Rummage through the trash I tossed all you want-because I don't even care."

Energy crackled through the crowdas they caught what she meant.

Right then, an online challenge swept through the chat.

"Join in!"

With both streams having disabled tipping, viewers decided to create their own contest.

Millie's side exploded with cheers and encouragement.

"Go for it, Millie! If you keep holding yyour ground, we'll buy the new collection!"

Vivian's audience wasn't far behind, spamming their own support.

"Stay strong, Vivian! We promised, if you keep it up, we'Il check out Love of Vivian when it hits the cinema!"

Tensions were hitting their peak as the showdown intensified.

As word of the showdown spread, even more people jumped in.

"Don't leave me out! This is wvild!"

"Turn up the drama! Things aren't nearly spicy enough!"

"Vivian, see if you can sneak a peek at their old bedroom!"

"Millie, don't let Vivian off easy! I can't stand how shameless she's being about wrecking someone's marriage!"

The two livestreams surged with loyal fans, each side determined to back their favorite until the end.

The comment sections erupted into a virtual brawl, fans on both sides firing shots.
News of the escalating drama quickly reached both Millie and Vivian.

A sly smile played on Millie's lips. What began as a bid for a little extra publicity had suddenly become serious.The outcome here could make or break the new product launch.

With fresh determination, Millie walked back to the golden river of sunflowers on display.

The framed photograph nestled among the blooms shimmered in the sunlight, though the joy once captured on those faces had vanished.

All that remained was resolve.

A firm promise to come out on top.

Millie's smile stayed flawless, every inch the poised host.

"Let's keep going, everyone," Millie announced, ushering the crowd deeper into the venue.

Meanwhile,excitement flickered in Vivian's eyes.

What could possibly be so special about Millie's endless rows of sunflowers?

Surely her own stream promised far more excitement.

Here she was, a notorious"home-wrecker" broadcasting live from the very place Millie once shared with Brandon, right in front of their old wedding photo.

Vivian believed nothing Millie put forward could ever compare to the surge of adrenaline she made the audience feel right now!

Riding that adrenaline, Vivian made her way into the kitchen. She arranged flowers in a basin, lifting them for her viewers.

"Monet's Water Lilies," Vivian announced brightly. With a playful tilt of her head, she asked, "Where do you think these belong?"

Vivian acted like she was genuinely interested in what her viewers thought.
Suggestions poured in at lightning speed.

Most fans were pushing for her to place the flowers in what used to be Millie and Brandon's bedroom.

"Actually, I've decided they'l look best in the bathroom," Vivian said as she shook her head. Vivian feigned surprise at the chat's suggestions, pausing dramatically as if she didn't want to step on Millie's toes.

She gave a decisive nod before she continued,"Let's take a look at what the bathroom has to offer."

Just then, her assistant's voice slipped through the live stream mic.

"Pretty soon, this will be Vivian and Brandon's bathroom."

Vivian's assistant probably thought his comment went unnoticed, but eagle-eyed viewers picked up on it instantly, clipped the audio, and made it viral.

The reaction was instant, with some viewers cheering while others recoiled in disgust.

A flurry of debate broke out.

"That was from the assistant, not Vivian!"

"But isn't Vivian the shameless one for streaming here in the first place?"

"It's just a regular broadcast, and it seems like Brandon approved. He and Millie are divorced, after all."

"This whole thing is gross, especially when they link it to Millie's stream! Seriously, I'm about to throw up."

Comments flooded in as viewers eagerly joined the conversation.

Meanwhile, the camera followed Vivian as she stood up and made her way toward the bathroom, tension building with every step.

Meanwhile, Millie guided her guests into the second showcase.

What looked like an ordinary sunflower field from the outside transformed into something magical once you stepped inside.

"Wow!"

A collective gasp swept through the crowd.

Overhead, the ceiling had been painted a mesmerizing shade of deep blue, casting the sunflowers in a new light and making their golden petals seem to glow even brighter.

The blooms appeared to dance in slow motion, as if drifting along a river of gold.

Unlike the simple outdoor display, this golden river shimmered with every step. Puffs of golden mist puffed out beneath their feet, giving the illusion of walking on sand-spun from pure gold.

Curious guests knelt down to touch the glittering mist.

"This feels unreal...Is this actual gold dust?"

"No way! Did they really pour so much into this setup?"

As everyone marveled at the spectacle, music began to fill the space.

Eva's latest single floated through the air, perfectly matched to the enchanting scene.

The romantic melody, paired with the shimmering sea of flowers, created an atmosphere that felt almost dreamlike.

Guests soon noticed something new. The sunflowers, carried by the golden current, were now interspersed with vibrant yellow gemstone blossoms.

Against the dazzling river, they sparkled like scattered jewels.

Back in Proidan.

Brandon had just wrapped up his business and finally able to breathe.

The moment Brandon's phone reconnected, he was hit with a barrage of urgent notifications.

His brow furrowed as he scrolled through the messages, quickly tapping the live stream link Eugene had sent. On the screen, both chaos and brilliance awaited him.
###Chapter 215 Create Your Own Story


Brandon instantly recognized the backdrop of Vivian's live stream.

Without another moment wasted, he stopped watching.

Instead of lingering, he immediately turned to the person-next to him and gave off instructions while dialing Eugene's number.

On the other end, Eugene picked up right away.

By that point, Brandon was already sliding into his car, arranging for the quickest helicopter route back to Crobert.

"Eugene, are you there?" Brandon's tone was sharp and urgent. "What's happening with Vivian?" asked Brandon.

He had been rushing through Proidan all morning, barely wrapping up his tasks, and was completely exhausted.

Trying to ease the pounding in his head, Brandon pressed his fingers to his temples. "I thought her first livestream was supposed to happen at Darden's place? So why is she at Serenity Villa now? Who gave her the door code·to get in?" His eyes flashed with icy suspicion.

"Wait, what?" Eugene sounded genuinely lost."Mr. Watson, weren't you the one who gave her the code and let her in?"


The reality was, nobody else had that information.

Access for the cleaning staff was granted only with temporary codes that would time out after twenty minutes.

Anyone needing access to the villa had to request approval first, with the butler double-checking their plans before sharing a temporary entry code.

After Brandon's recovery, he chose to move into an apartment across from the place Millie had currently lived,leaving the villa mostly unattended except for occasional maintenance.

With no hesitation, Brandon's voice was ice-cold as he snapped, "Find out who's behind this. Now."

Once Brandon ended the call, he dialed Vivian's number immediately.

No response.

He tried reaching Vivian's assistant next, only to be met with silence.

"Damn," he muttered, annoyance briefly crossing his features.

Brandon's right hand balled into a fist, slamming against the inside of the car with a solid, echoing thump.

Though his knuckles stung, Brandon barely flinched, forcing his eyes closed as he tried to steady his nerves.

A second later, something clicked in his mind, and he quickly called Darden.

Darden,meanwhile, was already fighting his way through heavy traffic en route to Serenity Villa.

As soon as Vivian's live broadcast started and some people recognized the background as Millie and Brandon's old place, soon crowds flocked to the address for the latest scoop.

Darden, sounding frazzled, updated Brandon about a broken water pipe and added, "I have no clue what she's up to. She hasn't checked in with me at all and just went straight there to your place."

"I'm heading over now," Brandon said, determination hardening his voice.

"You have my word, Brandon. I'll make sure she leaves," Darden assured him.

With that settled, Brandon wasted no time as he changed the villa's password right then.

Turning his attention to the live stream, he watched closely.

Millie was front and center on the screen, giving viewers a tour of the gemstone flower arrangements inside.

A new line of products had been unveiled in the middle of that sparkling display.
They were branded as the Golden collection.

Gleaming gold mist intertwined with the base of the gemstone flowers, creating the illusion of golden waves washing through a radiant river.

The glow from the overhead lights only emphasized its shimmering beauty.

Right there, customers could purchase items from the Golden collection, nestled among the dazzling flowers.

The entire setup looked less like a store and more like a luxurious mini gallery.

Everything sparkled, as if encased in a world of golden glass.

A dreamy atmosphere filled the air, thanks to Eva's enchanted song playing throughout the hall.

With every new piece, there was a delicate golden card, each one inscribed with its own message.

Millie exchanged a glance and nodded at someone off-camera.

Right away, a staff member stepped forward and began the story. "Once upon a time, a brave knight set out for a distant castle, determined to slay a dragon and save a princess. His bravery, gentle spirit, and sharp mind won her heart. Together, they stood before the king and pledged their love, living out their own happy ending..."

This felt straight out of a storybook.

Between the staff member's captivating narration, the golden glow, and Eva's enchanting melody, the entire space felt magical, like stepping into a real-life fairy tale.

Millie stood quietly, taking it all in.

Countless variations of this tale were told.

Back when she shared it with Brandon, she'd mentioned another twist, a tale where the brave knight vanquished the dragon to rescue a maiden, just to become a dragon himself among the rewards of triumph.

Timeless, yet always open to interpretation.
As the story wrapped up, the staff member added, "For the Golden collection, Elliott Group collaborated with acclaimed writers to craft short stories that celebrate friendship, family, romance, and all things bright.Many of these products come with their own tales, but for others, you're invited to create your own."

Moments after the announcement, several famous authors stepped forward and greeted the crowd.

With a small, satisfied smile, Millie watched visitors gather to read these tales, nodding her approval to the team.

The staff member soon returned, reminding everyone that only a handful of products came prepackaged with stories. Most awaited new narratives, written either by buyers or the crowd.

The online audience was already buzzing.

People wasted no time sharing their own stories, eager to see if anyone would be interested.

Before long, the Internet was buzzing with a brand-new trend.

A challenge named "Create Stories for the Latest Golden Collection" began spreading across the Internet.

One post sparked another, encouraging many to showcase their writing talents, and before long, Elliott Group's newest collection was the center of attention.

As the excitement kept building, Elliott Group jumped in, announcing plans to reach out to standout storytellers, offering contracts and payment for the best submissions.

Suddenly, everyone wanted to write the next great story.

Cheers in her earpiece signaled to Millie that everything backstage was running smoothly. She shifted her attention to the live stream, satisfied.

Meanwhile, Vivian spotted the growing excitement, but she played it cool and led her viewers toward the bathroom instead.

Her audience urged her to keep things interesting. The top comment flashed on screen read,"Millie's already made a move, Vivian! Your turn, do something exciting!"

At that exact moment, Brandon arrived at the helipad and climbed aboard.

He tried to send a comment through Vivian's stream since she wouldn't pick up his calls, hoping she'd see his warning, but his words got lost among thousands.

"Whoosh..."

With the engine roaring, the helicopter blades whipped through the air as Brandon took flight.

With the signal dropping, he could no longer followthe broadcast, so he fired off a message to Eugene as a backup plan.

"Reach out to the platform and pull the plug on Vivian's live stream."




Vivian's live stream continued as she strolled intothe bathroom.

"Hmm, where should I put this?" Vivian mused aloud, pacing around for her viewers.

She wanted everyone watching to get a full look at the batroom's layout.

It was a spacious bathroom, and Vivian wandered back and forth, narrating her thoughts as she explored.
Everything appeared ordinary until her gaze landed on a small door tucked off to one side.

"Hey, what's this?" she asked, curiosity sparked.

The chat exploded with guesses as she reached for the handle. Though she'd been given a password, it turned out the door was already unlocked. Someone must have opened it before her.

Stepping through, Vivian revealed a second, smaller bathroom that was nothing like the first.

A large floor mirror caught her eye, along with a sturdy metal handle installed nearby.
###Chapter 216 What's Wrong With A Married Couple Sharing A Bathroom


Vivian hesitated the moment she stepped into the unfamiliar space.

Confusion creased her face as she turned to Millie. "What is this place?" she asked, trying to piece together its purpose. "Millie, why is this here?"

Beneath her steady voice, anger made her hands tremble.

Just earlier, her assistant had warned her that Brandon had already tried to get in touch, but they'd ignored all his calls and acted as if nothing had happened.

Every door they might need was unlocked ahead of time, a precaution in case Brandon decided to reset any of the codes.

At the same time, the chats on both Vivian's and Millie's live streams were exploding, messages flooding in faster than anyone could read.

Myron's reaction was instant as he shot to his feet as soon as he saw what happened.

Gone was his usual polished composure.

A standard bathroom outside meant this inner room was clearly intended for the couple's private use.

After all, this was once supposed to be Millie and Brandon's home.

No furniture filled the space now, but the intimate design left plenty for people's imaginations to run wild.

It didn't take much to ruin a woman's reputation. Just the suggestion of slut-shaming alone could do lasting damage.

This small,secluded bathroom was more than enough fuel for rumors to start flying.

Even though Millie stood there fully dressed and her marriage to Brandon long over, there would always be those eager to twist the truth.

Myron's frustration boiled over.

He wasted no time, grabbing his phone to contact the streaming platform and demand Vivian's broadcast be shut down immediately.

"Just checking, my live stream won't get shut down, right?" Vivian asked, forcing a shaky smile. "I mean,there's really nothing to see here. If they cut the stream over this..."

"This is my very first luxury villa flower arrangement-stream," she added, trying to sound sweet and harmless, hinting that she could be treated unjustly simply because she was up against Millie. "Wouldn't it be a shame if it ended now?"

Vivian turned her gaze to Millie's side of the live stream and called out, "Millie,any thoughts on this?"

Meanwhile, chats exploded on both live streaming rooms, their comments blending into a frenzy. "Looks like the couple's getting cozy." "Vivian, what are youdoing in their private bathroom?"

Millie's expression turned cold.

"I don't run the live stream platform, Vivian, so that's not my call," Millie replied coolly. "As for this room, it's just an extra space off the main bathroom. For all anyone knows, it could be a closet."

Millie immediately saw through Vivian's real angle-Vivian was baiting her, hoping Millie-or maybe someone else-would jump in and end her stream.

If Vivian's broadcast suddenly ended, people would immediately blame Millie for it. Speculation would spread that Millie sabotaged Vivian's stream just to avoid losing. People would start believing she couldn't take defeat.

That sort of label would stick, and from then on, every future victory for Millie would be dismissed as a hollow victory.

People would be quick to judge. "She flaunts her wins, but when things go south, she just bends the rules. If that's allowed, then why shouldn't everyone else cheat, too?"

Meanwhile, Myron watched the drama unfold and paused, deciding not to force the livestream offline after all.

His frustration deepened as he tried to call Brandon, only to be met with a dead line

Brandon, at that moment, was still airborne in the helicopter.

"Let her do whatever she wants," Millie said to her walkie-talkie as she stepped away from the camera. "Al that's special about this place is the design. When I moved out, I took everything with me."

The furniture and keepsakes were gone, but the layout still echoed memories.

Luckily, aside from the bathroom's suspicious decor, there wasn't anything else remotely scandalous left behind.

For a while, neither said a word.

With the live stream still running, the private conversation had to be brief.

The camera captured only Millie's back, showing she hadn't left, but her quiet voice was lost to the audience.

Eventually, Myron's concern crackled through the line. "Hey Millie, is everything okay with you?"

What he really wanted to ask was whether she wanted to continue or not.

But Myron already knew that Millie wasn't one to quit that easily.

"I'm good," Millie replied, her eyes hard with resolve.

"Good" was an understatement-she was set on coming out on top.

Vivian had dragged her name through the mud for everyone to see. Letting that slide wasn't an option.

Yet...

A moment of hesitation flickered in Millie's eyes as she looked down.

Vivian's attempts at public humiliation were one thing, but nowN the gossip had shifted. Everyone was talking about Myron's relationship with her.
After people saw the bathroom, the narrative had changed, and they were whispering nasty things.

One comment, in particular, cut deep. "Seven years with Brandon. Millie's got nothing left to give. Myron must be regretting it all now!"

The thought of how Myron might feel gnawed at her.

"Hey, don't overthink it." Myron's gentle voice broke through the device, warmth woven through every word.Almost as if he could sense her worries.

Footsteps echoed in the background before he spoke again, softer this time. "Millie, look up here."

Raising her head, Millie caught sight of Myron standing by the upstairs glass, watching over her.

"Millie, I 'love you-no matter the circumstance, no matter what's happening. Out of everything in my life,being your boyfriend is what I cherish most. I'm right here for you, and that will never change."

Tears threatened to well up in her eyes.

He really had never left her side, not for a second.

All those years, he'd always been there.

A wave of emotion nearly broke her composure, tears prickling at the corners of her eyes.

Steadying herself, she finally whispered,"| know."

"You've got this, Millie," he said gently."Stick to your own plan. Losing just isn't in your nature."

A small,genuine smile touched Millie's lips.

She'd never once doubted her own strength.

Still,knowing there was someone in her corner-someone who believed in her, no matter what-brought a warmth she hadn't felt in ages.

Setting aside the walkie-talkie, Millie stepped back into the camera's framne.

Vivian appeared on the live stream as well, her smile brittle, eyes betraying a hínt of triumph.

"Millie, where'd you disappear to just now?" Vivian asked, her tone a mix of feigned confusion and sly amusement. "Was my live stream in this tiny bathroom too much for you to handle?"

Millie turned her attention to Vivian from live stream feed.

A clear, radiant light gleamed in her eyes. "I know what people are thinking right now. I'm well aware of what crosses everyone's minds the second they see this bathroom, no matter what words they use in public eventually."

There was a calm strength in the way she held herself, unshaken by judgment.

"There's no need for whispers or gossip. Let's keep it honest," she said, her tone firm but open. "Yes, this place once belonged to me and Brandon. That's the truth."

A bright, confident smile lit up her face.

The comment section went wild, but she held her head high. "And what's so wrong with a married couple sharing a bathroom?"

Vivian's composure faltered, surprise flickering in her eyes.

Before Vivian could say anything else, Millie lifted her hand in a graceful wave.

A staff member immediately stepped forward with a small tray.

"I asked someone to bring over a couple of things," Millie announced, fixing Vivian with a steady look. She knew these were the very items Vivian had always been curious about.

Confusion crossed Vivian's face. "What are you up to?"

Millie chose not to respond. With everyone watching, she moved toward a display platform set up nearby.

While the outer area showcased vintage street photos from 1935, this corner was reserved for more recent memories.

illie paused beside the platform, where a display frame was waiting.
With deliberate care, she pulled out two documents.

She slid them into place for everyone to see.

One was her marriage certificate. The other was her finalized divorce papers.
###Chapter 217 Exposing Vivian's Hypocrisy


Calm and unruffled, Millie stood her ground.

Fixing her eyes on Vivian, she spoke without hesitation. "If your big idea for this live stream was to parade my old house and dredge up pieces of my past just to rattle me, you've got it all wrong. Honestly, I find it pretty sad. I regret nothing I've done, and I'm not ashamed of loving someone who turned out to be the wrong choice."

With a deliberate gesture, she indicated the two new photo frames beside her.

She continued, "My marriage to Brandon and our divorce-they're both public knowledge. Everyone in Crobert knows my story. I don't have anything to cover up or pretend about."

Vivian went pale, her eyes filling with tears.

"I never meant it like that," Vivian protested, her voice wavering. "You've got it all wrong, Millie. I'm just here to live stream, that's all."

A slight smile crossed Millie's lips.

"Oh, have l?" she replied quietly, her eyes driftingto the stream's chat."YOUu picked the day, you picked the spot, you chose exactly what to show, didn't you?"

Vivian jumped in. "It just happened like this. All of it. Pure chance."

Millie echoed the word with disbelief. "Pure chance?"

Her smile sharpened, tinged with irony.

Millie didn't need to spell it out any further. The comments flying across the live stream spoke volumes.

Nobody watching the livestream was buying the coincidence excuse.

Millie had already spelled out that Vivian called every shot.
The Elliott Group's product launch had been planned and announced far in advance.

Suppose the timing lined up by accident, but what about the location?

Everyone remembered Vivian's live stream wasn't supposed to take place here at all.

Still,Vivian insisted it was all a fluke.

Even if the original venue fell through, there was no explaining why Vivian went to Millie and Brandon's old home and kept the camera focused on their wedding photo still hanging on the wall.④

Vivian was also the one who started the live link right then.

One or two lucky breaks might slip by, but after a while, the setup was too obvious. Vivian's choices were obviously intentional.

Coincidence didn't cut it anymore.

Besides, whether it was the wedding portrait left untouched or the suspicious decor of the bathroom,the message behind was clear-Millie and Brandon had genuinely loved eachother once.

There had been no betrayal. No outsider.

Their marriage had been real-recognized by the law, embraced by their families, and celebrated for what it was.

Seville's team stepped in1, bringing up what Millie herself would never say out loud.

"Any real product comparison should actually spotlight the product-like how Millie's streams always focus on the Golden collection. Even if there's a marketing stunt involved, it all boils down to what's being sold."

"Vivian tried to pitch her stream as an exploration of luxury floral design, yet the camera lingered on Millie and Brandon's wedding photo, and she couldn't resist taking a peek into their bathroom. The flowers barely got a mention."

ef've caught Vivian's other home tours and floral arrangement vlogs before. She never behaved this way in those videos."
"It's obvious. She's clinging to Millie's name just to pull her down."

All of this comeback had been planned through a quick phone call from Millie.

Vivian had been given more chances than she deserved.

Messages flooded the chat, each one zipping past faster than the last.

Fans who'd once felt betrayed by Vivian on Heavenly Melody finally found their voices.

Chaos erupted in the livestreamn room.

Millie didn't bother reacting to the disorder on Vivian's end.

A serene smile on her face, she turned her attention to the people gathered in person.

"Thank you for waiting. Let's keep going. Our final stop is just ahead," she announced, her tone warm and inviting.

No one needed to be asked twice. The group, satisfied with what they'd seen, eagerly followed her lead.

A light breeze flicked through the air, causing the prop documents to flutter open and expose the pages inside.

There weren't any specific details printed on them, just two unmistakable names.

Millie Bennett. Brandon Watson.

Stamped boldly across the marriage certificate prop-"CANCELLED."

The divorce certificate, meanwhile, stood as a symbol of Millie's fresh start.




Millie was already leading the group onward.

Meanwhile, Vivian was floundering, struggling to regain her composure.

Desperate for attention,she faked a bout of weakness, coughing in front of the camera.
But the ploy only made things worse for her this time.

"If you're feeling that unwell, there's really no reason to push yourself in a contest like this."

"Exactly. We keep cutting her slack because she claims to be sick. Millie never uses health as an excuse for sympathy."

These remarks were quickly lost in the sea of comments.

Tears brimmed in Vivian's eyes.

She gazed into the camera, a single tear slipping down and landing right inside the vase she clutched.

She quickly turned away, brushing the tear off her cheek before anyone could see.

Lowering her gaze, Vivian looked as fragile as ever. "I know nothing I say will change a thing. Simply by showing up here, I become the villain. It feels like even my existing is a mistake at this point."①

Meanwhile,Millie guided the group onward, bringing them into the next exhibit.

This space symbolized everything about the present moment.

A Polaroid camera sat nearby, waiting to snap new memories.

A sweeping golden river cut through the center, echoing the gemstone motif from the previous hall. Now,golden grains formed little beaches and jagged rock islands.

Scattered across the sand and stone, golden picture frames peeked out through wisps of river mist, lending the whole scene an air of wonder.

Each frame, unique in design and shape, stood ready with wide open space. Arranged before every frame,the latest pieces from the Golden series sparkled in the light.

Right as Millie was explaining the collection, Vivian's voice broke through."Millie!"

She turned toward the streaming device.

Vivian had fashioned a fresh bouquet, ready for the camera.

"These are Renoir's Roses," she said, her face still stained with tears.

Millie fixed Vivian with a steady look, saying nothing as she waited for her to go on.

Determined, Vivian swept away her tears with the back of her hand.

"Your opinion doesn't matter to me," she insisted. "None of what you accused me of was ever on my mind.I really never meant to hurt you. People kept urging me to check out the master bedroom, but I wouldn't do it.That was my way of showing you respect," Vivian added,her lips pushed out in a small pout.

Not so much as a flicker crossed Millie's face. "And then?"

Vivian's tears started to flow again. "Then I see that being kind is pointless with you. People are still convinced I'm here to attack you." Sniffling, Vivian dabbed at her eyes. "Fine, then. I'll just go anyway!"

Hurt pride and defiance warred in her tone, as though Millie had pushed her to this point.

A short, amused laugh escaped Millie at the display.

"If I asked you not to go, would that actually stop you? Drop the act, Vivian. If you want to wander in, then just do it."

Vivian didn't know how to respond after Millie's blunt words.

"You..." she stuttered, at a loss for anything else to say.

Choosing not to acknowledge Vivian, Millie pressed on, talking about the new collection to her group with barely a pause.

Viewers watching the stream couldn't help but burst into laughter.

"Millie's got some serious backbone," someone commented.

Keeping her gaze fixed on the floor, Vivian masked the bitterness brewing inside her.

Just then, a message came through-Eugene and Darden had arrived outside the villa. Her security team still held the entrance, but they were running out of time.
She needed to act fast.

Refusing to back down, Vivian muttered, "You can't keep me out of the master bedroom just by telling me to stay away.

Millie, you've set upo surprises for the launch. What's next? I can't wait tofind out."

Receiving no answer, she watched as Millie finished her product presentation, unbothered.

Soon after, Vivian picked up her bouquet and headed straight for the master bedroom, determined to see the place Millie and Brandon once shared.

Off to the side, Millie placed a call. "It's time, Myron," she said, a satisfied smile lighting her eyes.

Somewhere beyond the villa, the distant whir of helicopter blades drifted closer, growing louder by the second.

###Chapter 218 Myron's Bold Declaration Of Love


At Serenity Villa, Vivian gently placed the vase on the table. The live camera followed her every move.

The master bedroom appeared on screen.

Sunlight poured in through large windows, bathing the room in a soft glow.

Open wardrobes lined the wall, filled only with cool-toned men's suits. Not a single item of women's clothing could be seen.

Still, the empty space beside the suits hinted that someone else's clothes had once been there-now gone without a trace.

A double bed stood against the wall, plush and inviting. Everyone watching knew this was where Millie and Brandon used to sleep.

Beside the bed sat a nightstand, and on it, a bottle of perfume.

Vivian walked over, vase in hand.

"Maybe I'll put it here," she said quietly, as though she truly cared where the flowers should go.

Her assistant quickly stepped forward, camera ready, and began snapping photos of the nightstand.

"Chanel No. 5," Vivian said softly, lifting the bottle and spraying it on herself.

She had taken Millie's husband. Now she wore Millie's perfume. And soon-she would lie in Millie's bed with Brandon.

As these thoughts crossed her mind, something caught her eye. The top drawer of the nightstand was slightly ajar, like someone had opened it in a hurry and left it.

This visit was unannounced. Her team had unlocked the door beforehand so Brandon couldn't change the passcode, but no one had checked the nightstand.
"What's this?" she muttered, catching her assistant's attention. He pointed the camera at the drawer.

Urged on by the flood of live comments, Vivian pulled the drawer open.

The camera zoomed in, showing everything inside.

There was only a single sheet of paper.

On it, a handwritten message read, "The wedding ring is here, and goodbye."

Millie's name was signed below, along with a date-almost two months from now.

It was the note Brandon had never seen, the one waiting quietly in the drawer the day he coughed up blood.

A faint ring mark still lingered on the paper.

The livestream exploded with comments.

The note made it clear-Millie had left with a clean break. No drama. No second thoughts.

One comment floated to the top. "I don't know why, but this room and that note make me feel a little sad.It's like watching love fade away right before my eyes."

Vivian didn't check the comments. Her focus had shifted.

"Her wedding ring?" she muttered under her breath. She placed the note and the perfume on the table and leaned in. "Where's the ring?"

A wicked idea sparked-what if she wore Millie's ring just to provoke her?

But the drawer was empty. Only the note remained.

Vivian shut it and reached for the next drawer.

Suddenly, a loud bang echoed.

The door flew open, crashing into the wall.

Vivian spun around. The camera followed.

Eugene and Darden stormed in with a group behind them.

Eugene acted fast. He spotted the camera and yanked the broadcasting gear. The live feed then cut off.

The audience saw a final shaky glimpse-Eugene's face, a blurry screen, and then a freeze-frame of the note and perfume on the nightstand before everything went dark.

At that same moment, over at Elliott Group, Millie was already leaving the scene as Vivian entered the master bedroom.

She had reached out to Myron.

He was waiting not far off.

The live camera followed her steps, the frame trembling slightly.

Behind Myron stretched a golden river and a sea of sunflowers that swayed in the breeze.

He stood there, smiling.

At last, Millie reached the platform.

The third venue turned out to be a cleverly disguised counter.

Right where the photo booth stood, Myron waited.

It was an open space. A crowd had gathered.

"You're here," Myron said, extending his hand.

Millie placed hers gently into his.

she replied softly, stepping up with his support.

Beside them, the Polaraid was ready. At that same second, the echo of a door slamming at Serenity Villa rippled through theair.

Then Myron leaned in and kissed Millie-right there in front of the live audience and the crowd.

The camera captured it perfectly.

At the exact moment, Vivian's frozen livestream stilI showed Millie's note from months ago. "The wedding ring is here, and goodbye."

The two scenes side by side hit like thunder.

Some people in the crowd were watching thelive feed too.

One of them even screamed in excitement. But their scream was swallowed by a louder sound.

A helicopter.

The roar of spinning blades shook the air. Sunflowers bent in waves.

A massive wedding photo frame shimmered under the golden light.

Heads turned.

A helicopter was landing on the rooftop across from the field.

Comments exploded.

"Oh my God, it's Brandon!"

"He came by helicopter!"

The crowd went wild.

Wind tousled Brandon's hair as he stepped off the aircraft. He looked across the field.

Millie and Myron had just broken their kiss.

Now, Brandon stared at.them from afar. He locked eyes with Myron. For a moment, they simply looked at each other.

Then Brandon turned and disappeared from the rooftop. He appeared seconds later in the glass elevator,descending quickly.

His gaze never left Millie. But Millie never turned.

She faced the camera, photo in hand, and calmly walked to the empty frame.

The lens followed her.

She slipped the photo into place and turned to the camera.

"This is what I brought to the third venue. The first two were the past. This one is the present," she said.

On screen, people were moving aside for her naturally.

She smiled and tightened her grip on Myron's hand. "I've stepped out of the shadows. And I have something to share," she said.

Millie looked up at Myron. He smiled back.

"We're together. Millie is now my girlfriend," he said.

Vivian's stream was still frozen on Millie's note.

Behind Millie's live camera, Brandon stood in the space the crowd had cleared.

This was their official announcement-not just words, but a public declaration. The same way she had once announced her divorce with Brandon.

Sunlight washed over everything. Both Millie's and Myron's smiles glowed with happiness.

But it wasn't the end. Something more was coming.

A strange feeling crept over Brandon. He suddenly felt afraid-and terribly so.
###Chapter 219 Set Their Wedding Photo On Fire


Brandon had a gut feeling-something big was about to happen.

The moment Myron's eyes met his, cold and unreadable, Brandon was certain Myron had planned something.

Vivian's livestream had finally ended. Now, only Millie's was still running across all platforms.

The votes were counted, and Millie had clearly won.

Instead of keeping the stream going, she turned it off.

But the tangled story between her, Myron, and Brandon was already out in the open for the world to see.

Outside, a crowd of reporters was buzzing-snapping photos, filming, streaming live.

Brandon had flown in by helicopter, only to find Myron and Millie announcing their relationship to everyone.The moment was now a storm of emotions, played out in public.

Brandon stepped forward, wanting to say something. But Myron raised a hand, and Elliott Group's security quickly blocked Brandon's path.

"Millie,"Brandon called softly, his eyes locked on her.

But Myron stood in front of her, shielding her with a sharp, cold glare.

Nearby, the golden river flowed quietly.

Millie stepped forward-not toward Brandon, but toward the watching crowd.

"The three venues I visited today connected the past and present. Now, this river branches," she said,standing on the symbolic river of choices.

She took a step forward. "One path leads to the future. The other leads back into the same old cycle."
Alone, she walked forward as all eyes followed her.

She made her way into a wide sunflower field-golden, hopeful, alive.

A drone flew overhead, capturing it all.

At the heart of the field stood a tilted photo frame stuck in a flowerpot.

It held a wedding picture of Millie and Brandon, glowing under the sun.

Millie walked slowly toward it.

Everyone watched in silence. Would she throw the photo away? Tear it up? Something else?

She stopped in front of it and reached out, gently touching her own smiling face in the photo. Her hand moved downward,resting on the place where their hands, with their wedding rings on, were joined.

Just when people thought she might break down or say something emotional, she took a lighter from her pocket.

Without a word, she lit it. The flame kissed the very spot she'd just touched-their joined hands.

Gasps erupted.

"Gosh! She set it on fire!" someone shouted.

"She's burning her wedding photo with Brandon!"

Millie stood still, watching calmly as the fire spread.

She had applied a fire-enhancing agent to the photo earlier.

Once lit, it burned fast and bright.

Brandon,standing at the edge of the field, tried to rush forward, but the security team held him down.

The flames danced across the photo.

Ash floated into the air, some strands catching in her hair.

The drone continued to hover, capturing and broadcasting this moment live.

The flames devoured their clasped hands, her wedding dress, and the happy smile she wore when she looked at him.

She was burning the past.

Soon, only a piece of Brandon's face remained.

Millie had disappeared from the photo entirely.

Then the crowd noticedsomething. The frame had two layers.

As the first layer burned down to just Brandon's face, a second photo slowly came into view beneath it-a blue-toned image.

Millie looked at it.

She had already made up her mind to leave Brandon behind. That was why she never planned to leave their wedding photo there. So from the start, she had told Elliott Group to prepare a double-layered frame.

The reason she'd touched the photo earlier was to confirm where the fire enhancer had been applied.

Because it was summer and they were outdoors, only a little was used to avoid accidental burning.

Vivian's livestream had been a surprise, so much of this had been arranged last-minute by Millie,with Elliott Group handling the details.

Myron had chosen the second-layer photo.

Millie hadn't seen it before.

Now, as the fire receded, the new photo came into full view.

It was taken by the sea.

Millie, in a flowing blue dress, stood barefoot in shallow water, splashing the waves with her hands. Her face was full of pure, unguarded joy.

Beside her, Myron held her heels and looked at her with soft eyes overflowing with love.

They were gazing at each other-Millie unaware of her blooming feelings, Myron quietly hiding hís.

It must've been taken on their first date. Though the magnificent blue rain had stopped by the time the photo was taken, remaining traces were still there.

Drops of blue rain lingered in the sand, making it seem like a scene straight out of a fairytale

Millie paused.

She stared at the photo, her fingers gently brushing her smiling face, and then settling on Myron's eyes-those deep, tender eyes.

She had never seen this photo before.

She hadn't realized how happy she looked beside Myron.

He must have loved her deeply.

The flames had consumed her past with Brandon. Now, only the present remained.

Her eyes shifted to a smaller photo tucked inside the edge of the frame-another shot by the sea, in winter,on a wooden deck.

It was the very moment Myron had once described-standing under the night sky, watching the blue rain falling on the ocean all night long.

Her eyes welled up. Her heart fluttered.

She smiled softly.

Myron always knew how to surprise her, how to love her in ways that brought peace.

The final bit of Brandon's photo burned away.

The drone hovered overhead, still capturing it all.

This was no longer Millie and Brandon's story. It was now Millie and Myron's.O
Two pairs of people. One lost to time, the other glowing with love.

Millie touched the frame. It wasn't too hot.

She unfastened the clasp and pulled the burned top photo frame away.

As she did, something fellout.

It was a ring-strung on a thin metal wire.

It now dangled gently over the second photo, catching the sun and sparkling above the sea, above her and Myron.

###Chapter 220 Millie, Let's Get Engaged


Millie stared at the ring, her expression vacant.

She hadn't realized Myron had come up behind her.

"Is it to your liking?" he asked from over her shoulder.

Millie glanced up at him, catching her reflection in his eyes.

Reaching for the ring, Myron held out his other hand, open and steady,waiting for her to place hers in it.

"Will you allow me to be the one who stands by your side?" he asked, his voice carried clearly by the nearby drone.

Then he sank to one knee, gazing at her.

"Millie, let's get engaged," he said simply.

Myron had thought about proposing outright, but he felt a real proposal should have a bigger, more special moment.

Traditionally,engagement followed a proposal. But this wasn't a traditional situation.

They both knew this step didn't guarantee marriage.

It was something they had already discussed and accepted.

Regardless,it marked progress, an evolution beyond just calling each other boyfriend and girlfriend.

And...

MAyron noticed the slight redness around her eyes.

All he wanted was to make life easier for her, to be the steady hand she could hold on to when things got hard.

He couldn't stand the thought of her hurting.

"Millie!" Brandon's voice rang out from a distance.

Millie didn't flinch, didn't even glance toward the sound. Her eyes stayed on Myron.

"Are you certain?" she asked softly, her chest tightening, warmth rising in her throat.

"I've been certain for years," Myron answered.

Their eyes locked, and Millie was suddenly taken back to that moment in the hot air balloon-the quiet studio, his voice, his promises, the little things he'd shown her that had stayed with her ever since.

That day, just before they left his place, he had watched her cradle the cat in her arms, gently stroking its fur,and said in a quiet voice, "Millie, don't ever worry about being a burden or making things hard for me.You can be exactly who you are when you're with me."

Millie looked at Myron now. He had meant every word.

He'd once told her he could clearly tell the difference between love and gratitude. His feelings hadn't grown from obligation; they came later,when he matured and truly saw her.

Still, he never downplayed the help she'd given him back then. He always acknowledged that he wouldn't be who he was without her.

All his actions had been meant to reassure her.

Meanwhile, Brandon was still resisting, and the backup he'd called had shown up, sparking a clash between the two sides.

Onlookers crowded around, phones raised, voices rising in excitement as they snapped photos and gossiped.

The sunlight beamed down, but Myron, still on one knee,saw only Millie.

She was all that mattered to him.

"Millie." Noticing she'd gone quiet, Myron spoke softly."Let me take care of you-please?"

Millie blinked, snapping back to reality. She smiled and nodded.

"Alright," she said, her eyes welling with tears.

She placed her palm on his.

The drone continued broadcasting, and the crowd broke into cheers

Myron held her hand firmly and slid the ring onto her finger.

It was a brilliant blue diamond that sparkled under the sun, matching the pendant resting at her collarbone.

He knew her completely.

He knew there were many things that mattered to her-her father's death, Ari, and the Bennett family.

He knew he wouldn't always come first in her life. But he didn't mind and still stood by her.

Myron rose to his feet, still gripping her left hand tightly.

That was when Brandon finally got to them.

He glanced at their hands, locked tightly together, and at the ring resting on her finger.

The sun was warm, yet no warmth touched his skin.

Only cold.

"Millie," Brandon called,his eyes red.

But Millie didn't respond. Her only answer was the way she clutched Myron's hand even tighter.

Brandon opened his mouth to speak, but she didn't look at him. Her eyes remained on Myron.

She'd already said everything that needed saying.

"Just go," Millie finally said. "Brandon, we each have someone we care for now. Look ahead. Hold on to the people by your side. Stop hurting those who love you like you did to me."

It was the last thing she had to tell him. After that, there was nothing left for them to say.

Brandon started to speak again, but the Elliott Group security guards stepped in and restrained him.

Millie smiled, glancing up at Myron beside her, and together, hand in hand, they took another path.

From a distance, Brandon stood frozen, watching them disappear.

The sun caught the diamond on Miilie's finger, casting sharp reflections that made him flinch.

And in that moment, it hit him...

He'd never actually proposed to her.

No ring chosen with care. No flowers. No heartfelt ceremony. Not even a simple question on bended knee.

He never even asked whether she was willing to be his partner.

All he had done was walk into a jewelry store on their way to see his grandfather, pick out the first set of rings they saw, and slip one onto her finger casually.

Millie and Myron had vanished beyond the sunflower field. The security team no longer blocked Brandon's way.

He stood alone, staring at the oversized photo frame nearby.

He raised his hand to touch Millie's smiling face on the photo.

She looked radiant and happy.

Brandon couldn't remember the last time he'd seen her smile like that.

Then his eyes dropped to another smaller photograph tucked in the edge.

He recognized it. That was years ago, in Eldoria.

"So... you'd already noticed her back then," Brandon thought.

A hollow laugh slipped from his lips. "Myron, you planned this from the start."

Brandon could still hear Millie's voice in his head. "Look ahead. Hold on to the people by your side. Stop hurting those who love you like you did to me."

The sun was bright, yet Brandon felt like his heart was drenched in rain.

He had only ever loved Millie.How was he supposed to just "look ahead" when she was walking away?

"Brandon!" Darden's voice came from beyond the sunflower field.

"I've got back-up!" he called out. "Do we go after them?"

Brandon pulled his eyes away, walked straight to the vehicle, opened the door, and got in.

"Drive," he said. "Let's go after them."


···

Meanwhile, on Elliott Group's end, the key players had already left, but the aftermath stirred nonstop chatter.

"Myron pulled it off; he proposed!"

"Millie and Myron are officially engaged!"

The news spread like wildfire.

Whatever talk there had been about Myron losing interest in Millie was silenced.

He loved her fiercely and had proven it openly.

Since the experience hall was set up like an interactive showcase, it drew a lot of attention.

Visitors who came were deeply moved and ended up making purchases, not just because the new designs were outstanding and Elliott Group's quality was reliable, but also because the venue and storytelling created a powerful emotional pull that sparked a surge in sales.

For those arriving later, a particular highlight drew attention: the pair of prop documents Millie had once placed inside the exhibit.


But they had been replaced. In their place now stood a gemstone sculpture, crystal-clear and flawless.

The sculpture featured a dragon, carved in striking detail, shielding something beneath its massive wings.

Visitors leaned in, trying to see what the dragon was protecting.

It was a single teardrop.

While the meaning was left open to interpretation, rumors continued swirling.

"I heard Brandon's assistant, Eugene, stormed into Serenity Villa and cut Vivian's livestream."

A bunch of people saw it; there was a full crowd at the gate!"

"So Vivian went in to livestream without Brandon's permission?"

###Chapter 221 How About You Move In With Me





Online chatter exploded, each commenter tossing in their own tidbits as if piecing together a scandal.


"That adds up. I mean, if Brandon really invited Vivian in, why are his wedding photos with Millie still up?"


"Exactly. Brandon might be a shameless player, but |bet he'll never tolerate strangers digging into his personal life."


"And look at that master bedroom-definitely not set up for guests."


"So, did Vivian just let herself in? And purposely use Millie and Brandon's old newlywed home as her livestream backdrop? That's beyond disgusting."







The buzz only grew louder when a clip surfaced-
grainy footage of Eugene forcing his way inside.


The moment it hit the web, every suspicion flared into certainty.


Eugene probably had the villa's code-if not before,then certainly now-and no one doubted he'd acted under Brandon's orders.


Still, the fact that he'd needed to break in suggested someone inside had locked him out on purpose.


"What the hell is happening? Can anyone explain?"


The question hung in the air, but no one had answers. The whole place was a storm of confusion.






Far from the chaos, two cars cut through the evening streets.


Up front, a sleek Bentley carried Millie and Myron;behind, a Porsche kept a steady distance, Darden at the wheel.


In the Bentley's backseat, Millie idly rolled the ring on
her middle finger, and then brushed her fingertips over the heart-shaped pendant at her chest, a faint,private smile tugging at her lips.


"Feeling tired?" Myron asked warmly, threading his fingers through hers. He lingered there, pressing each finger gently before locking their hands together as if he had no intention of letting go.


The past few days had left Millie exhausted-handling Ari's matters, overseeing the second product launch, and now enduring the unexpected mess of today had sapped her strength.


"Yeah, a little," Millie admitted in a low murmur.


Before she could say more, his broad palm eased her head down until it found a resting place against his shoulder.


At first, her spine stiffened with a flicker of nerves,but the steady, unhurried rhythm of his touch smoothed them away, lulling her like a quiet melody.


A sudden laugh bubbled out of her.
"Is this how you used to get your younger siblings to sleep?" she teased, tilting her head to glance up at him.


"Huh?" Myron blinked, caught off guard.


Her soft chuckle turned into bright laughter, the sound warm enough to draw a grin from him. Once he caught her meaning, he reached over and gave her cheek a playful tap.


"Mom and the nanny handled Adriana and Jayceon when they were little. I never had to put them to bed," he remarked, lips curving.


Then, with a faintly mischievous glint, he went on,"But... I have done it plenty of times for Kiki."


Kiki was his ridiculously spoiled, round-bellied ragdoll cat.


"To be exact, it loves it when I give it pats and chin scratches," he explained, reaching over to mimic the motion on Millie.


Millie batted his hand away with a light smack,
narrowing her eyes at him in mock outrage. "Oh, so now I'm your cat?"


Myron broke into unrestrained laughter, leaning in to tap her cheek with a teasing touch. "You really do look like Kiki right now-especially since Jayceon's been teaching it to put on a dramatic act all day. It pulls the exact same face you make when you glare at me now."


His eyes sparkled with amusement as he studied her,and truth be told, the resemblance was uncanny.


Millie had only been playing around,but his comment made her laugh despite herself.


Up front, the driver glanced at them in the rearview mirror,a smaIl, contented smile tugging at his lips.


Moments like this-lighthearted, full of warmth-were rare treasures.



After a stretch of playful back-and-forth, Myron eased her head onto his shoulder again, his touch gentle.
"Once Ari's adoption paperwork is finalized, how about you and your mother-and Ari, of course-move in with me?" he suggested, his tone casual but his eyes holding intent. "There are a few independent villas within the same estate, so both you and your mother can have your own place but still be close enough for easy visits."



He knew the history between Millie and Nicole, the tangled feelings that weren't easily unraveled.


His arm tightened around her shoulders, voice dripping with quiet resolve. "Millie... let me take care of you,alright?"


She tilted her head up to meet his gaze.


He'd said something like this before, but this time,the words carried weight.


Moving in together marked a shift-one that hinted at a deeper commitment.


She trusted Myron not to push her into sharing a room, yet she couldn't ignore how different life would
feel compared to living on her own.


Myron's voice softened, careful as if he were stepping on eggshells. "Do you need more time to think? Or... is it something you'd rather not do?"


Millie's focus shifted back to him, her eyes catching on the blur of scenery rushing past the window.


She'd already accepted his proposal to get engaged.


Now, all he wanted was for them to live together.


The words she'd spoken to Brandon earlier still echoed in her own heart-what was gone was gone,and the present was worth holding onto.


"No," she responded with a soft smile. "I was just thinking about packing my things."


"I'll have Maggie bring a few people to help you later," he noted, his palms cradling her face before pressing a warm kiss to her forehead.


"There's no hurry," Myron added, though beneath his calm tone, he was itching to fast-forward the days
until she was his completely. "Close your eyes for a bit. Charles and the others want to have dinner with us tonight."


He eased her into his arms, pulling her snug against his side.



"Alright," Millie murmured, a faint smile on her lips.Before long, her breathing slowed, and she drifted off, her head resting warmly on his shoulder.







In the Porsche trailing behind, Darden kept one hand on the wheel and flicked quick glances at Brandon.



Brandon sat rigid, eyes locked on the recording of Vivian's live stream that he'd missed earlier thanks to the choppy helicopter signal.


With each passing second, his grip on the phone grew harder, his knuckles whitening-especially when the footage panned over the bathroom and the master bedroom.


His fingers clenched until the leather case creaked,
his expression black as a gathering storm.


From the driver's seat, Darden shot him a careful glance before informing Brandon, "Eugene saw your message. But when Vivian mentioned her stream might be cut, and he couldn't reach you, so he called me.We figured if the broadcast really ended just then, everyone would pin the blame on Millie. That's why we decided to break in instead of simply cutting her livestream off. Eugene made sure to get caught on camera himself, so no one could accuse Millie for it. Once the feed was cut, he confronted Vivian while I brought in backup."


Brandon gave a single, curt nod, the shadow on his face deepening.


It had been the right move-maybe the only one.


Neither spoke again. The car sped on, headlights slicing through the fading light as the scenery blurred into a smear of color outside the windows.


When the red light held them in place, Darden broke the silence. "So, Brandòn... Vivian really showed up
on her own? You didn't give her permission?"


Brandon's eyes slid toward him, sharp and unreadable.




Flustered, Darden stumbled over his words. "I just meant-how did she even get in? When I got there,Eugene was still interrogating her."


Brandon's gaze drifted forward again, head tipped slightly, eyes shadowed. Truth was, he wanted the same answer.


The light shifted green. As the car rolled forward,Darden muttered under his breath, "Myron actually proposed, and Millie said yes. Are they really going to get married?"


Brandon kept his eyes on the road, the question hanging heavy between them.


Would they...really get married someday?
###Chapter 222 Please Give Her Back To Me





Brandon's mind reeled at the very notion, threatening to shatter his composure entirely.


He refused to accept it-absolutely refused.


His hand, draped carelessly at his side, betrayed him with its subtle tremor.



When he had first returned from Proidan, shock had numbed him completely, leaving him drowning in a turbulent sea of confusion and rage. But now terror gripped.him with icy fingers.


Real, bone-deep fear consumed every rational thought.





Millie had accepted Myron's proposal and they were now engaged.


Despite her crystal-cleàr rejection of him, despite
watching her choose Myron right before his eyes,Brandon still clung to the desperate belief that she belonged to him.


He had secretly secured an apartment in her neighborhood, positioning himself like a phantom observer, confirming that she remained alone-that she hadn't moved in with Myron yet.


He'd whispered reassurances to himself that they were merely dating, that relationships crumbled al the time.



But an engagement? That changed everything.


Seven years they'd shared together. And those secrets he'd never dared confess to her.


The image of her sleeping peacefully beside another man nearly destroyed what remained of Brandon's sanity.


He squeezed his eyes shut, desperately fighting to banish the torturous vision.


The vehicle glided into the parking structure of a
towering building.


"Brandon, we just received word that Myron's vehicle is stationed here, but they haven't emerged yet."Darden's voice dwindled to barely a whisper.


The engine had died, and their driver had already departed. So why hadn't they stepped out?


Were they having some intimate conversation in the parking garage?


Darden couldn't bring himself to meet Brandon's gaze.


Brandon's expression remained perfectly blank, but a soft crack echoed through the silence as his phone screen spider-webbed under the crushing force of his grip. Darden witnessed the destruction and inhaled sharply.


Brandon's fury had crushed the device in his bare hands.



Darden bit back any further words and gunned the engine toward the coordinates his surveillance team
had provided.


The solitary vehicle waited in the shadows, and Brandon launched himself from the car the instant they stopped, striding directly toward his target.


Brandon's hand hovered at the car door, uncertainty paralyzing him before he could knock. But fate intervened-the door swung open and Myron stepped out.


Brandon seized the moment to peer inside,discovering Millie fast asleep, her body curled against the opposite window.


As Myron carefully eased the door shut, Brandon spotted the telltale creases on Myron's shoulder.


In that devastating instant, understanding crashed over him like a tidal wave.



They'd remained in the parking structure because Millie had drifted off while resting against Myron's shoulder.


Millie had always struggled with sleep, her traumatic
past transforming her into the lightest of sleepers.Throughout their years together, Brandon had witnessed her nightmares tear through the darkness on countless occasions.



During those dark hours, he would stroke her back with infinite tenderness, whispering reassurances that the past could no longer hurt her, that he stood sentinel over her dreams.



But now... she trusted Myron with such complete abandon!



Wasn't she terrified of what Myron might attempt while she lay defenseless in slumber?


The realization sent agony ripping through his chest like shattered glass.


As Myron secured the door, Brandon opened his mouth to speak, but Myron gestured for them to move their conversation elsewhere.



Brandon's glare burned into Myron before shifting to the car where she slept. He gave a curt nod.
Brandon observed Myron lock the vehicle with meticulous care, safeguarding her sanctuary, before trailing him into the distance.


Myron measured the distance between them and the car with calculating precision, confirming their voices wouldn't carry back to disturb her rest, and then pivoted to confront Brandon.


Brandon met his gaze with arctic coldness, hatred crystallizing in the space between them.


They faced each other in suffocating silence,with Darden maintaining his watchful distance.


Without warning, Myron's fist exploded across Brandon's face with brutal precision.



"Brandon!" Darden's shocked cry shattered the stillness as he sprinted forward.


Myron refused to relent, seizing Brandon's collar and slamming him against the concrete wall. His fists hammered down in relentless succession, each blow carrying accumulated rage.
Yet Brandon absorbed each strike without fightíng back, his body accepting the punishment as if he welcomed the pain.


"Myron, stop!" Darden lunged between them, his arms wrapping around Myron's torso as he struggled to pull him away.


"What's gotten into you? Why are you beating him senseless?" Darden's chest heaved with exertion as he struggled to restrain Myron's muscular frame.


"Release me!" Myron's command sliced through the air.



But Darden's grip remained ironclad.


Brandon's head drooped forward, crimson streams painting his lips where Myron's knuckles had found their mark.



Myron's laughter rang hollow/and cruel as it echoed off the walls.



His gaze pierced Brandon with arctic coldness as the words poured forth. "Brandon, I used to believe that
even after falling for Vivian, you'd still harbor some shred of compassion for Millie. How spectacularly wrong I was!" His voice dripped with contempt."You actually allowed Vivian to broadcast her live stream from the very house you once shared with Millie. You couldn't even be bothered to remove your wedding photograph or alter a single piece of decor. Now she's drowning in public ridicule while malicious gossips weave their poisonous theories about you two. Is this the outcome you craved?"


Myron's eyes transformed into dangerous slits as he delivered each word with calculated precision. "If that's your truth, then you've proven yourself to be absolutely..." He paused, savoring each syllable. "A truly despicable excuse for a man!"


His fist cocked back for another devastating blow.


Darden's reflexes kicked in, intercepting the attack.


"Hold on..." His voice trembled with urgency."Brandon had no knowledge of how Vivian infiltrated that house. I'll stake my reputation on that fact.Originally, Vivian was scheduled to film her broadcast
from my residence instead. If you had witnessed the live stream, you would have seen Eugene and me breaking down the door to terminate Vivian's transmission."


Myron's penetrating gaze shifted to Darden, who responded with a solemn nod of confirmation.


Myron's eyes narrowed into calculating slits as contemplation consumed him.


One hand remained trapped in Darden's grip while the other maintained itsstranglehold on Brandon's collar.



Suddenly, his fingers released their hold on the fabric.





Darden's relief lasted mere seconds before Myron's palm clamped around Brandon's jaw with renewed fury.


Brandon's skull then connected with the unforgiving wall, the impact reverberating through the parking structure.
"Stop this!" Darden surged forward again, but Myron's free hand pressed against his chest, holding him at bay.


Myron studied Brandon's battered form with clinical detachment.


"The damage has already carved its path, and Millie bears every scar." His voice turned arctic as he pressed closer. "Tell me this-if Vivian had approached you directly, requesting permission to use your villa for her broadcast, would you have granted her wish?"


Brandon met his gaze, eyes swimming with blood and anguish.


"Give me an answer!" Myron's demand cracked like a whip.


"I would have refused." Brandon's voice emerged as a tortured rasp. "I never intended for her to violate that sacred space with her presence."


The truth was, he'd never permitted Vivian to cross
that threshold-not once.


Years ago, when she'd attempted to deliver flowers to their doorstep, he'd instructed the butler to handle the exchange, barring her from entering their sanctuary.


Millie had declared it their home, and he'd honored that designation with religious devotion.


So when Brandon discovered the butler had mistakenly placed those flowers on their dining table,he immediately hurled them into the garbage,erasing every trace of Vivian's unwelcome intrusion.


"My regret runs deeper than oceans," Brandon whispered.


Tears carved silver tracks down his bloodied cheeks.



During the torturous drive here, the pieces of what had transpired in Crobert during his absence had finally assembled themselves into a devastating picture.


Now he could no longer weave lies to convince
himself that Vivian possessed even a fragment of genuine kindness.





Or perhaps he'd always recognized her true nature but had foolishly believed he could orchestrate every outcome,using self-deception as his shield.


"Don't bind yourself to her through engagement.Don't choose a future with her."


Brandon's plea carried the weight of his shattered soul.





"Myron. Please..." His voice cracked like breaking glass. "Give her back to me."
###Chapter 223 Millie Is My Fiancee





Myron's hand was smeared with tears and blood as he held on to Brandon, who stood there, looking completely broken.


Darden was shocked.


He had known Brandon since they were boys, and Brandon had always been the one who led their circle.


Brilliant and capable, Brandon had steered the Watson Group through a flawless transformation,raising it to the top of Crobert's three giants.


To Darden, Brandon was as solid as a granite wall against a raging storm. He had always carried himself with authority.


He had never seen Brandon cry before.


Darden's eyes darted around, catching sight of
Myron.


He had never imagined that the ever-smiling, gentle,seemingly refined Myron could carry such menace.


The look Myron had given him earlier had sent a genuine chill down his spine.


That gentle attitude had been nothing but an act!


Myron made his move without the slightest hesitation when he had to.


What had happened? How had it all come to this?


Instinctively, Darden glanced toward the car parked in the distance.


Was this because of Millie?


As he wrestled with the thought, Myron gave a cold mirthless laugh.


"Brandon, do you really think a few words and some tears will make me hand her back to you? You must be out of your mind." Myron's voice was cold. "Also,she's not some trinket to be claimed. You never
respected her, Brandon. You never cared about what she felt, about her sadness or her happiness."


Brandon swallowed down his grief, raising his face to look at Myron. "What if she says she loves me? That she wants to be with me? Would you let her be with me?"



The two men stared at each other, and the parking lot fell into a tense, heavy silence.


Finally, Myron spoke. "Hasn't it been that way all these years?"


Millie's heart had once belonged to Brandon, and for that reason, Myron had been content to just quietly protect her.


He remained in the background, never interfering.


He only wanted her happiness.


But over time, he saw the truth. Millie wasn't happy She was often in tears, and he could no longer bear to watch her suffer.
Brandon was speechless, lowering his face as if a memory had been awaken in his mind.


"I saw that photo, from Eldoria... years ago," he said at last.


Myron gave a small laugh. "It all began even earlier than that."



"Please," Brandon whispered. At this, Darden glared at Brandon in shock.


Myron didn't respond. He simply stared at Brandon,his eyes cold.


When Brandon looked up again, he saw the determination in Myron's eyes.


Brandon understood at once the silent response-Myron would never let go.


Brandon gave a low, bitter laugh.


He didn't know how it had come to this, how everything had spun out of his control.


And now, he could do nothing to change it.
"| won't let her go," Brandon muttered. Blood and tears streaked down his face.


"Myron, I will not let go!" he repeated himself fiercely.


Myron's eyes stayed cold as he looked at the man before him. At last, he released Brandon's hand.



He let go of Darden, drew a handkerchief from his pocket, wiped his palm, and tossed it toward Brandon.



"Whether you let go or not doesn't matter," Myron said. "You should understand that she's my girlfriend now...No-"


He paused, and then continued, "Millie is my fiancee.She's accepted my proposal. She wears my ring.We'll live together, get married, have children, and grow old side by side."


Myron's eyes swept over Brandon, his expression filled with contempt. "As for you...you can keep living with Vivian."
There was more Myron could have said.


Vivian's treatment of Millie was far from settled, and he already had plans in motion. But Brandon didn't need to know them.


With that,Myron glanced at Darden.


Darden quickly stepped aside, knowing better than to get in his way.



Myron turned and walked towards the car.



Darden rushed to steady Brandon.


They both looked up just in time to see Myron lift Millie gently from the car.


She stirred faintly at his touch.


"Where are we?" she asked, her voice drowsy.


"The parking lot," Myron replied with a gentle smile softening his face. With his free hand, he shut the car door. "It's alright. Go back to sleep. I'll carry you upstairs."
"Mm..." Millie purred, wrapping her arms around his neck and resting her head against him.


Holding her close, Myron turned to give Brandon and Darden one last look before stepping into the elevator.


Brandon's chest burned with anger, his eyes fixed on them with fury.


Darden let out a sigh.


"Brandon, let's get you cleaned up," he said gently.


But Brandon shook his head. He wasn't going anywhere; he needed to see Millie and explain things.


There was no way he could wait another moment.


Before he could move, his phone rang with a call from Eugene.


Brandon frowned.He knew Eugene was with Vivian,and he felt an instant wave of reluctance at the mere thought of her.


Still, he answered.
"Mr. Watson, something's wrong..." Eugene's voice held hesitation.


"What is it?" Brandon asked, wiping at the grime on his face.


"Miss Simpson had another depressive episode and cut her wrist again," Eugene said with a weary sigh.


"I'm at the same sanatorium as before. I know you're busy, and I didn't want to reach out. But she said..."Eugene swallowed nervously, and then said, "She said if you don't come, she'll end things and take the secret from a year ago to her grave."


Darden, listening from nearby, instantly caught the meaning.


"That's a threat!" he snapped.


The day's events had already soured his opinion of Vivian. He had let her use his villa for her streaming,and now she was repaying him with endless trouble.


He even suspected she was behind the damage to his water pipes.
"Brandon," Darden said, teeth clenched, "you can't let her keep pulling you around just because she cut her wrist. You need to figure out how she even got into your house. Besides, my place is still flooded."There was a hint of frustration in Darden's voice.



Brandon tightened his grip on the tissue in his hand.


His eyes drifted toward the elevator, as if willing them to pierce the walls and reach Myron and Millie.


"Mr. Watson?" Eugene called anxiously from the phone.


"I see," Brandon said at last.


Vivian's mess would have to be dealt with first.


Depression?


Brandon let out a humorless laugh.


After overhearing Vivian's doctor's call last time, he had looked into the man and uncovered proof of their conspiracy.


He had chosen not to expose her then, sparing her
feelings. But now, she was using the same trick again?







And there was still the question of how she had entered Serenity Villa.







With these issues in mind, Brandon climbed into the car with Darden, and they drove off toward the sanatorium.
###Chapter 224 Vivian, Are You Still Pretending





Brandon and Darden hurried to the sanatorium.


Not long after, Darden said he had some matters to attend to and left, leaving Brandon to make his way alone through the quiet corridors to the ward Eugene had told him about earlier.



Eugene was waiting outside. The moment he saw Brandon, he rose to his feet. "Mr. Watson."


Brandon nodded briefly and asked, "What's the situation?"



Eugene hesitated, and then explained from the beginning. "After Mr. Harris and I stopped Vivian's livestream, I thought it wasn't appropriate to let her stay at Serenity Villa, so I took her to a nearby apartment. While I was trying to convince her to tell the truth, she suddenly cut her hand."
At the time, Eugene had been genuinely shocked.


Vivian had pulled out a knife so suddenly that, for a moment, he thought she meant to stab him.


"I brought her here right after. The doctor treated the wound,"



Eugene continued. "The bleeding has stopped, and the caregiver is looking after her, but..."


Brandon caught Eugene's implication and nodded."Find her previous attending doctor. Also, get her medical records from the archives and bring them al here."



Eugene exhaled, relieved to have clear instructions.He stood up and hurried off.


Once Eugene was gone, Brandon pushed open the door.



Vivian was half-reclined on the bed in a single ward.Her wrist was swathed in thick bandages, with faint streaks of red blood seeping through.
Beside her, the caregiver sat peeling an apple.


Vivian looked pale. At the sound of the door, she turned her head. When she confirmed it was Brandon, she gave a strained smile.


"Brandon, you came." Her voice was fragile. "I thought you wouldn't visit me anymore."



Brandon said nothing. His eyes were cold.



He walked straight to her bedside but didn't address her. Instead he looked to the caregiver. "What medication is she on?"



"She had a sedative earlier. Right now, she's on a glucose drip," the caregiver replied respectfully,standing. "We're waiting for her attending physician to arrive and adjust her medication."



Glucose.



Brandon's eyes flicked back to Vivian, who still wore a pitiful expression.



Inside, Brandon was laughing coldly.
"You can go now," he told the caregiver.


The woman nodded, set the apple on a nearby plate,and left, shutting the door behind her.


Brandon pulled a chair closer and sat, watching Vivian in silence.



She shifted uncomfortably under his stare, and a chil ran through her. But remembering her plan made her compose herself.


"Is there something you want to tell me?" Brandon asked. "Or maybe something you need to confess?"


Vivian hesitated, guessing this was about what had happened at Serenity Villa.


She pressed herlips together as tears suddenly ran down her face.



"Brandon, I know I shouldn't have gone to Serenity Villa to livestream without your permission."



She had been winding herself into a bad mood earlier, and now that Brandon was here, she found
the perfect opportunity; the tears flowed freely.


"But Darden's place had a burst pipe. I had no choice but to go there."


She suddenly sat upright, clutching his hands and sobbing. "I didn't know what was going on there.I didn't know the wedding photo of you and her was still there... Brandon, I didn't mean to. I'm sorry."


Vivian's tears slid onto Brandon's hand, making her look all the more pitiful.


"I didn't know it would hurt her. I've been so full of regret... I've thought about it over and over, and l can't stand myself like this, so l... I'm sorry."


Her voice trembled as she put up a show of tears and emotions.



The folding knife had been prepared long before.She'd cut her hand in front of Eugene on purpose,knowing he would stop her before she went too far.


She hadn't even cut deep-just enough for a little blood, just enough for the show. All that was left later


" even dragged you into trouble by hurting myself,"she said, sobbing even harder and cautiously sneaking glances at Brandon's face.



But from the moment he walked in, his expression hadn't changed; it stayed cold.


She was trying to gauge him when Brandon suddenly laughed.


He actually laughed loudly


Vivian froze.



"Brandon?" she asked in a shaky voice,sniffling.


"Enjoying the performance?" Brandon glared at Vivian, his eyes full of disdain.


He had given her one last chance to come clean. But even now, she clung to her lies.


Her clumsy little act made him laugh.


He was angry at himself for ever believing her.
"Brandon, I don't understand what you mean," Vivian said, fear starting to seep in, though she kept up the crying.


"You don't understand?" Brandon's laughter vanished,replaced with coldness.


A knock distracted them.



The door opened, and Eugene stepped in, handing over a file folder and a stack of papers to Brandon.


"Mr. Watson, the documents you asked for. And the doctor is on his way. He'll arrive shortly," he said.


In his other hand was another file. He hesitated,unsure whether to give it to Brandon or not.


He had accidentally stumbled into it from the archive.The archive clerk had carelessly handed him two documents.



One was Vivian's record, and the other was Millie's.


He weighted his options and then decided to hand the document to Brandon in private once this was
settled.



With that decision made, Eugene gave a slight bow before turning to leave, the door clicking shut behind him.



The room was quiet again, with Brandon and Vivian being alone.



Brandon flung the file onto Vivian's bed.



She wiped her tears, glancing at it.


"What's this, Brandon?" she asked, making no move to touch it.



"Your medical records," Brandon said flatly.



He threw the other stack Eugene had handed to him beside it.



"And this?"



"An analysis report," Brandon replied, his voice still cold. "Vivian, are you still pretending? You're not sick.At all."
The words caught Vivian off guard, but when she realized he meant her so-called depression, she eased a little.


"I don't know what you're talking about, Brandon,"she blurted, breaking into tears and tossing the papers and records aside.


"Did Millie say something to you?" Vivian's eyes darkened with resentment. "She's lying!"


Brandon's lips curved into a bitter sneer.


"She hasn't mentioned you once."


In truth, Millie didn't even want to see him, let alone talk to him.


"Vivian, what do you take me for?" His voice was low but burning with fury.


He glared at Vivian.


"To deceive me? To threaten me?"


He had completely overlooked the harm she caused Millie because of her act, her fake depression.
He had let it slide again and again
###Chapter 225 Medical Records Of Millie





A rush of intense hatred tore through Brandon, and his stare carried the chill of a man ready to kill.


Vivian faltered for a split second, thrown off balance.How had Brandon figured out her depression was nothing but an act? Did that mean he'd also uncovered the truth about her fake stomach cancer?


Vivian kept her eyes down, terrified that even a glance at Brandon might betray the secrets she was hiding.


"Speak up!" Brandon's voice erupted like a whip,sharp and cold, with a dangerous edge that made her flinch.



Vivian's chest tightened.


She hadn't prepared for this kind of confrontation, so she blurted out through tears, "It wasn't me."
She pulled the needle free and broke down completely, her sobs wild and unrestrained.


"It wasn't me!" She shouted, her tone spiraling into frantic hysteria. "I don't know who's after me,Brandon,but someone's trying to ruin me! Is it Millie?Eugene? Or somebody else?"


Her cries grew louder, the desperation in them believable enough to pass for real.


But Brandon's eyes stayed cold, his expression unmoved.



"Brandon, if you think I'm lying, then let me die..."


She twisted on the hospital bed, making a wild attempt to slam her head into the wall.


Still, Brandon didn't move, his gaze frozen on her like ice.



Vivian's mind raced. Should she actually go through with it? Did she really have to crash into the wall now?
She hesitated, uncertain.


"Go on," Brandon taunted, his lips curling. "Weren't you about to slam into the wall and end it all? Why aren't you doing it?"


His tone dripped with mockery.


Vivian braced herself, ready to give her head a light tap against the wall and fake a collapse, only for a sudden knock to interrupt her.


Relief flooded Vivian, and she quickly wiped at her wet cheeks before glancing toward the door.


The same attending physician from earlier stepped in.




Clutching at the chance, she blurted, "Please,doctor! You have to help me, l-"


But the doctor's face hardened. "Vivian, I'm done covering for you."


Brandon's smirk deepened as Vivian froze in place.


"You!" Vivian snapped, pointing a trembling finger at
the doctor, her eyes blazing and her words momentarily stuck in her throat.


"Stop pretending already," the doctor said, darting a wary glance at Brandon. "Mr. Watson's been aware for some time. I'm just an ordinary man, and I can't afford to take risks. Vivian, whatever's going on between you two, settle it yourselves. Leave me out of it."



Every part of him screamed a desire to cut ties completely.


Vivian's fury burned hotter.


Her gaze flicked back to Brandon.


Brandon still wore that mocking smile, his dark eyes cutting into her like blades.


"Who paid you off to frame me?" Vivian snapped,turning around to glare at the doctor with seething accusation.


The doctor, however, came prepared. Without a word, he pulled a small recorder from his pocket and
hit play, letting the sound of their earlier scheming fill the room.



Once the recording ended, he handed the device straight to Brandon. "Here's the original copy. I've given you everything. I'm out of this now."


He didn't wait for a response, slipping out and shutting the door behind him with a sharp bang.


Brandon turned the recorder over in his hand before pressing the button again. Vivian's own voice spilled out again-"Just diagnose me with depression, say l can't handle stress, especially from Millie, and that l need Brandon's care and attention..."



This time, the color drained from Vivian's face for real, stripping away the painted paleness her makeup had created.



Brandon stopped the playback and raised the recorder as evidence.



"Got anything to add?" he asked with a cutting smirk.

"Or are you going to tell me it's all fake?"
Vivian's lips parted as if to speak, but nothing came out.



"You're finally smart enough not to pile on another lie," Brandon said coldly. "This is the original recording. It can be verified by voiceprint identification."



Brandon's voice went frigid, almost daring her to answer."Vivian, what else do you have to say now?"


Vivian stared at Brandon, knowing the act was over.


There was no point hiding anymore.


"Fine," she admitted. "I made it all up. I was never depressed."


Without warning, Brandon's hand clamped down on her shoulder, pushing her back until she hit the wall.


His eyes burned red, and his jaw was locked tight.


"Why would you do something like this?" The words came out low and strained, forced through clenched teeth.
Wasn't she the one who always claimed to be gentle and sincere?



Hadn't she insisted she only had six months left to live, saying all she wanted was to spend that time with him?



He had ended his marriage to Millie and stayed by her side. So why was Vivian still lying, still going after Millie?



But Vivian only laughed.


"Why?" Vivian's lips twisted into a smirk. "Isn't it obvious? If I didn't pull all of this, Brandon, would you have given me more of your time? Even with me supposedly dying, you still kept your distance. I had to push further, to make you see me as a patient, to make you remember what you promised."


Vivian's gaze locked on Brandon's as her voice rose."You swore, Brandon. These last six months, you'd be with me, you'd love me."


"| already left her!" Brandon's voice thundered with
fury.


"But you still won't marry me!" she shot back. "You won't even touch me!"


Her breathing turned sharp and heavy with anger.


"Didn't you send Eugene to ask how I got into Serenity Villa? Fine, I'll tell you."


Vivian's glare cut straight through Brandon.


Each word landed with deliberate weight. "Simple.I guessed the password. I went through every number I could think of, yours, hers, even the ones tied to both of you. The date that signified Watson Group's complete transformation. Your wedding day. Millie's birthday. Even dates I dug up from other sources, like when you two were in Flesta."



Vivian's glare burned with pure malice toward Millie."And guess what? The front door's code is her birthday. The code to the small bathroom? The day you married her!"


Her mouth curled in contempt. "You swore you'd love
me-and this is what you call keeping that promise?"


"Vivian!" Brandon's voice explodedd like a crack of thunder.



"I did it intentionally." Vivian straightened her back and met his eyes without flinching. "I walked in there on purpose, went live on camera just to humiliate her,to show everyone that I, Vivian, have taken her place as Mrs. Watson, and she's nothing but a discarded woman."



Brandon's hand dug harder into Vivian's shoulder the pressure so fierce it felt as if he wanted to snap her in two.


So all those words before were just a performance.


Every move had been about going after Millie, about hurting her.


A discardded woman?



He'd never let Vivian degrade her like that.


Still, Vivian pressed on. Suddenly her lips trembled
her eyes glistened red, and the tears came on cue."Brandon, I know I crossed the line, but | couldn't stop myself."


Once more, she slipped into her victim act.


"I envy her for having your love, while I gave you everything and still couldn't win your heart. I know l made mistakes..." Her voice cracked as she sobbed."I won't be jealous of her anymore, Brandon. Just...don't leave me."


It was all calculated, carefully chosen emotions, a few undeniable truths twisted into a different story.


She wanted him to believe her love had blinded her,that her missteps came from passion, and that she was ready to change.


Brandon stared at Vivian, a hollow laugh escaping him.



He had wronged Millie time and time again for a woman like this.


Right then, his self-loathing deepened, cursing
himself for ever believing Vivian could be kind and gentle.


The red in his eyes deepened.


"I don't raise my hand against women," Brandon said,loosening his grip on Vivian's shoulder.


"But if pretending to be depressed is what you enjoy..." His tone dropped to ice. "Then you can live with the real thing."


Before Vivian could even process the words,Brandon's gaze had shifted, and he was already walking away.


Eugene was waiting just outside.


Brandon murmured a brief instruction to Eugene.


With a firm nod, Eugene replied, "Understood. I'll make sure Miss Simpson gets a true taste of it."



"Also..." Eugene hesitated, and then pulled out a folder and handed it over to Brandon. "Mr. Watson, I just found this in the archive. It's Mrs. W- Miss
Bennett's file."
###Chapter 226 That Was His Last Chance





"What?" Brandon blinked, momentarily thrown off.


What was Eugene talking about? Millie's medical files?


"Mr. Watson, when I went to the archive to get Miss Simpson's files earlier, I mentioned your name as her emergency contact." Eugene said. "The clerk at the desk probably made a mistake and also pulled up Miss Bennett's records."



Brandon's brow furrowed as his gaze dropped to the papers in front of him.


"So you're telling me. These are Millie's medical records from her visits here?" he asked slowly.


Eugene exhaled slowly. "I wasn't certain at first either," he said with a nod. "But after reviewing the details, there's no doubt. Miss Bennett began
..treatment here more than a year ago."


He hesitated, his eyes shifting toward Brandon with a trace of unease. "She's been seriously ill."


Brandon felt as if the world around him had tilted.


None of it seemed real.


He reached forward and took the stack of documents from Eugene.


Without another word, Eugene stepped back and went to take care of other tasks, leaving Brandon standing alone in the hushed corridor.


Brandon took a deep breath and began flipping through the recordds.


The notes weren't filled with personal accounts. They only charted the steady decline of her health, the treatments attempted, and the medications prescribed.


But the dates...


His knees felt weak, and he sank into the nearest
bench, eyes lifting to the sterile white ceiling glowing under fluorescentlight.


Every entry pointed to the same thing-her condition was getting worse each time she came in.


In the later reports, the doctor had even considered contacting her family despite her constant refusal to involve them.



One note stood out. Two months ago, her condition had taken a sharp turn for the worse.


It was the exact time when they had been stuck in the court-ordered waiting period before their divorce.


And during those days, she had a few accidents and had been in the hospital.


He had never gone to see her.


And then came...


The auction.


Brandon shut his eyes, and a sharp ache spread
through his chest.



How could he ever fight her over that tanzanite for Vivian's sake? That was the birthstone she had chosen for their future child.



The thought clawed at him until it was almost unbearable.



He kept reading the medical records, going through them again and again. His hands shook as he gripped the pages tightly.


The notes showed that she had refused the medication at first. Later, she had told the doctor she was willing to take it.


The timing lined up exactly with their first trip to the courthouse.



Now he understood.



After losing the child in Flesta, the grief had carved a wound so deep that neither of them could escape it.They had both longed for another.
She must have refused the medication because she desperately wanted to conceive a child.


His fists curled, trembling harder.


But it was that night when she had finally given up on him completely.


He couldn't even recall the exact words he had thrown at her.



What he did remember was mentioning the divorce.


She had looked straight at him and asked, "Does it have to be like this?"



"And what about me?" she had asked him.



Her voice had stayed steady when she asked again,"Are you sure this is what you want?"


And finally, she had only said, "Alright."


Four short lines. Three of them seeking an answer.

Was the last one agreement, or was it surrender?


Why hadn't he seen it then?
When he thought back to that night, all he could remember was the heat of their bodies tangled together and the irritation that surged in him when he mentioned divorce.



He hadn't realized it was her last attempt to hold on to him.



Her last chance.


The sharp smell of disinfectant clung to the corridor.His tears struck the pages, one drop after another.


Brandon's grip on the documents shook, the pages quivering in his hands.


For the first time in his life, he understood what real regret felt like.


If only he had seen it back then.


If only he had taken the last chance she had offered him.Would everything be different now?


Her voice from that day in the sunflower field still rang in his ears.
"Brandon, we each have someone we care for now.""Look ahead. Hold on to the people by your side.""Stop hurting those who love you like you did to me."


And he could still remember her words from the charity gala, when they had stood together on the terrace garden.


"Mr. Watson, you shouldn't let your concern reach past your partner, or else you'lI only end up betraying her." "That kind of thing would only break her heart."


"Some people hardly matter, Mr. Watson, but some really do. And if someone important chooses to walk away, you might never get a second chance."


It was him. He was the one who had kept wounding her, over and over, until sadness was all she had left.


She had been so broken, and so sick, yet she had told no one. She had tried to treat herself quietly,without drawing attention. Because they had both wanted a child, she had refused to take the medication that could have helped her.
Meanwhile, Vivian had pretended to be depressed just to pull his focus toward her and keep herself from being blamed.


The truth was brutal-Millie was the one who had been truly ill.


If that employee in the archive hadn't made that careless mistake, Brandon would still be in the dark.


While she was fighting her illness, what had he been doing?


A bitter laugh slipped from his lips.


He had been making it worse for her, adding to the weight she was already carrying.


In fact, it was his fault she had fallen ill in the first place.


Brandon flipped through the records, searching for the date of her first appointment.


And then he began searching his own memory, trying to pinpoint what had happened during that time.
Something that must have broken her completely driving her to seek help when the symptoms could no longer be ignored.


Brandon's thoughts wandered, pulling up memories one after another.



It felt as though time itself was moving backward.


The more he thought about it, the more he realized she had been pulling away from him little by little.


Eventually, he could pinpoint the exact moment when something in her had changed.


Her eyes, once filled entirely with him, had begun to lose their light. The warmth had faded, replaced by quiet disappointment. And eventually, she had let go for good.


It had been about a year ago. She had come to him holding her phone, saying they needed to talk.


"Brandon, she sent me a message." She had been wearing a long white dress that day, her hair smooth and flowing over her shoulders. She looked calm on
the surface, but her voice carried a faint edge.


Holding out her phone, she remarked, "Brandon,I need you to explain this. I've been hearing rumors about you and that florist, Vivian. And now she's messaged me herself. It's a direct provocation."



He had barely glanced at the screen before irritation flared.



"She didn't need to send you anything. Millie, what's going on with you lately? You're always like this. Do you know how exhausting it is?"



"This is the message she sent me. And you think I'm overreacting?" Her eyes had reddened as she pressed on. "I keep getting messages from her... with photos of you dining together, going out together,and other things."


Her voice had grown sharper. "Brandon, my husband is surrounded by gossip, and a woman like that has the nerve to provoke me directly. How am I supposed to just ignore it?"
"Millie, | told you l've been busy," he replied,struggling to keep his temper in check.


But she wouldn't let him walk away. She wanted an answer.


At the time, Brandon had been hearing about Darden's own mess-how his girlfriend was throwing fits and threatening to harm herself just to get his attention. Darden had complained to him over drinks more than once.


That was when another thought crept into Brandon's mind.


"Millie, are you having someone send you those photos and pretending they came from Vivian? Just so you can confront me?"


"What did you just say?"


Even now, he could still see the color draining from her face in his memory, and the way her eyes filled with disbelief and hurt.
###Chapter 227 Brandon's Nightmare





That day, Brandon and Millie had a vicious argument.


By the time it was over, her cheeks were wet with tears, while he felt nothing but annoyance.


Wanting to put distance between them, he turned to walk out. But before he could leave, she called out after him, "Brandon, after all these years, after everything we've shared, is that truly what you think of me? That I'd forge documents and lie just to frame someone else and get your attention?"


He stayed silent in that moment. Then, he just grabbed his jacket and headed for the door.


Yet right as he reached the entrance, the sharp crash of breaking glass echoed from behind him.


It wasn't until later that the maids told the details.


"Mrs. Watson's hands were trembling so much she
dropped the glass."


"She felt nauseous and started vomiting, but the doctor said nothing serious was wrong."


"Mr.Watson, Mrs. Watson has been in low spirits and crying. Would you like to check on her?"


Back then, he'd written it off as nothing more than a ploy to make him soften.


But now...


Brandon's gaze locked on the bold letters stamped across the medical report-"Psychosomatic Symptoms." The truth slammed into him, and he realized he'd been completely wrong.


The truth now stood exposed, knocking the wind out of him as though the room had been stripped of every last breath.


He knew all too well that after her father's death,Millie had gone from a pampered heiress to an ordinary woman. Even after her mother married Hayden, Hayden had treated Millie with relentless
cruelty.


When Hayden ended up in prison, Millie's relationship with her mother only grew colder.


Brandon had always knowvn Millie leaned on him for everything, her one source of love, her anchor, her family.


And still, he had betrayed her.


He couldn't begin to imagine what went through her heart the moment he walked away that day.


Maybe it felt like her entire world had crumbled beneath her feet.



Yet back then, he hadn't seen it.


Back then, his attention was entirely consumed by looking after Vivian.


Overhead, the corridor light buzzed and flickered,casting the space in an unsteady glow that made it feel unreal, as if he'd stepped into a scene from a nightmare.
How Brandon wished it was a nightmare, one he could wake from to find her still there, with everything unbroken and time left to make it right.


But the sharp sting from his fingernails digging into his palm made it painfully clear this was no dream.


A single image flashed in his mind.



It was the profile picture of the mysterious sender when Millie had shown him those provoking messages.


Back then, he gave it only a passing glance,dismissing it because the profile wasn't Vivian's, and deciding Millie must have been lying.


Now the truth slammed into him-he'd seen that profile before.


It had been at the charity gala. When he returned to his seat, his eyes had drifted to Vivian's phone, and there it was... Vivian's alt account.


Brandon shot to his feet.
The abrupt movement sent a wave of nausea through him, his vision dimming for a split second, yet that image in his mind only became clearer.


Clarity hit him like a man gasping for breath after nearly drowning.


He stormed into Vivian's hospital room, closing the distance between them in long, determined strides.


At that very moment, Vivian was in the middle of messaging Oakley.


Oakley was the one who had arranged her attending doctor, and now, feeling betrayed, she was furiously firing off texts demanding answers.


Thinking Brandon had already left, she didn't even glance up when he walked in.


It wasn't until Brandon, eyes blazing red with fury,pulled the phone from her hands that she reacted,lunging for it. "Brandon,give me my phone!"


She was using her alt account to talk to Oakley,and there was no way she could let Brandon see what
was on it.


Normally, she was meticulous, deleting her messages right after each exchange, but this time,the most recent ones were still sitting there since they were still in the middle of their conversation.


Vivian lunged forward and attempted to grab the phone,but Brandon pinned her in place with one firm hand.



His eyes flicked over the screen, catching her insults toward someone named "Blade Joker," and let out a cold,humorless laugh.


Without pausing, he began scrolling through her contacts.



"What are you doing, Brandon!" Vivian screamed."You can't go through my phone like that. That's an invasion of my privacy!


Brandon brushed her off.


Soon,he found the contact he was looking for, Millie and opened the chat.
The conversation thread held nothing but the automatic greeting message after the friend request was accepted.


Brandon understood instantly that the messages were gone because Vivian had erased them.


When Millie had shown him the chat logs, the timestamp on the greeting message matched this one perfectly.


And when he'd looked through Vivian's conversation with Blade Joker, the earlier exchanges were missing entirely. Still, from the tone and context of her recent messages, it was obvious this wasn't their first conversation, hinting that Vivian routinely deleted her messages.


"What are you doing, Brandon?" Vivian's voice pitched higher, her panic spilling over into a desperate shout meant to hide her unease.


Without warning, Brandon pushed her back against the wall, his gaze blazing. "Did you send messages to stir up trouble for Millie?"
"No, I didn't!" Vivian blurted automatically.


"I've already seen the proof!" Brandon shot back, his jaw tight. For the first time, he looked at her and felt nothing but disgust.


"That was all her lies-"


"Vivian!" Brandon's voice cracked like a whip. "Don't think wiping them locally makes them vanish. I can pull the cloud backups. I can recover every single file from your phone. So are you going to admit it now,or should | dig it all up myself?"


Confronted with this version of Brandon, Vivian's bravado faltered completely.


She knéw exactly how vicious her messages to Millie had been.



And if Brandon uncovers them...


Upon seeing that Vivian refused to come clean,Brandon's expression hardened as he pulled out his phone and called Eugene.
Eugene wasted no time showing up.


"You can't do this!" Vivian screamed. "It's my personal privacy!"


Brandon let out a cold sneer. So now she thought throwing around privacy rights would intimidate him?


"Mr. Watson." Eugene greeted as he arrived.


Brandon extended the phone toward Eugene.


"I'll talk!" Vivian broke down, her voice shaking through her sobs.


There was no way she could let Eugene get his hands on her phone.



Even though she usually used a different device for things like this, this one still held plenty of dangerous secrets.



She knew Watson Group had top-tier data recovery specialists.


She preferred to reveal only what she chose, rather than risk Brandon taking her phone, digging through
its data, and uncovering everything she'd been hiding.





Tears streamed down Vivian's face as she reached toward the phone.


This time, Brandon didn't block her and simply watched with a cold stare.



Vivian unlocked a hidden folder, fingers trembling as she keyed in the password.


Before she could open anything, Brandon snatched the phone right back.


His eyes flicked to the folder name-"Trophies."


The implication couldn't have been clearer.


Brandon leveled Vivian with a stare so cold it felt like it could freeze the air between them.



Vivian didn't dare meet his gaze; she kept her head bowed, her crying soft and pitiful.


Inside the folder was a collection of images, neatly arranged by date.
It was obvious she had taken screenshots before erasing the messages every time.



The first read, "You should know who l am. Do you like the flowers in your living room today? I sent them. He said they were beautiful."
###Chapter 228 That Incident FroOneYear Ago




Every message, from the first to the last, made Brandon's fingers tighten around the phone.


"Rainy nights aren't lonely for me because he's here with me. What about you?"


"He said he has feelings for me."


The final message lit the screen. "He came to see me again."


Each word cut deep, twisting like a blade in his chest.


Everything Millie had claimed was true.


Vivian had been the one sending those messages,stoking the fire again and again.


Hurting Millie had always been her game.


And he-he had been complicit.
This was the very cause of Millie's illness.


A sharp crack split the air.


The phone screen shattered in Brandon's grip.


In one swift move, he caught Vivian by the collar and slammed her against the headboard.


His eyes burned red, his face a mask of fury.


"You!" His chest rose and fell in harsh bursts, the words barely making it past his lips.


"You've been faking it all this time!" Brandon's voice thundered through the room.


Vivian flinched at the force of his yell but refused to back down.



"Why did you send those messages to her? Say it!"His words dripped with fury.


Vivian's shoulders trembled, but her lips curled into a mocking smile.


That smile only pushed him closer to the edge.
"Vivian!" Brandon shouted, his voice breaking with rage.


Still, Vivian didn't stop smiling.


"Why?" Her laughter spilled out even as tears filled her eyes. "Brandon, you've always known. I want you."


"I'm jealous of her. I can't stand the thought of you two being happy together. I don't want you hanging on to her. I want you to divorce her. That's why I sent those messages," Vivian said, her tone disturbingly casual.


Brandon's chest tightened as heat surged through his veins.



How could she speak about it like it was nothing?


Hadn't she always sworn she never wanted to hurt Millie? And yet, this was exactly what she was doing.


Rage clawed at him, and the urge to end this with his bare hands nearly consumed him.
"Don't forget, Brandon. You made me a promise,"Vivian said, a slow smile curving her lips.


"Would you really dare tell Millie what happened a year ago? Would she really survive knowing the truth?"


Vivian kept smiling, and then shifted her gaze toward Eugene.


"You can leave. You shouldn't be here for the rest,"Vivian remarked, her voice sharp and dismissive.


Eugene didn't move. His eyes flicked to Brandon,ignoring her completely.


He was Brandon's assistant, and he only took orders from him.


Brandon's bloodshot gaze stayed locked on Vivian.Hatred filled every corner of his mind.


He grabbed her collar, clenching his jaw so hard it sent pain shooting up to his temples.


"Mr. Watson?" Eugene asked quietly.
"Go," Brandon instructed, his voice cold enough to freeze the air.


"Understood." Eugene gave a small nod, turned, and shut the door behind him.


The ward had grown quiet, leaving only Vivian and Brandon inside.


Her phone lay on the floor, its screen shattered into a spiderweb of cracks.



On the table, a half-peeled apple sat forgotten.


The IV bag beside the bed swayed gently on its hook.


Vivian gripped Brandon's wrist, trying to force him to release her collar, but his hold didn't loosen.


Vivian let out a laugh through falling tears.


"Brandon, don't you remember? I suffered because of her! Millie was supposed to be there, not me.Could you really stand to watch the woman you love go through what I went through? I'm only asking for six months. No-there are four months left now. In
four months, I'll be gone. Everything will disappear,and I'll take that secret with me to the grave."


Her voice was steady, but every word carried weight.


The silence that followed pressed heavily against the walls.


Brandon's hand shook as it clutched her collar.


A year ago...


The memory of that day clawed its way back, nearly splintering his composure.


When he'd rushed over after hearing the news... And when he'd seen Vivian instead of Millie, relief had slammed into him.


Thank God it wasn't Millie. Thank God she was safe.


Vivian's sobs drew him back to the present.


"Brandon, I know l've made choices that hurt you,"she said, tears sliding down onto the back of his hand.
"I sent her those messages because my mind was twisted back then. I wasn't thinking clearly."


Her crying deepened, each sound heavy with despair.





"Brandon, if you were in my place, you'd understand.After everything I endured, all I could do was watch the man I loved stay by another woman's_side...I know sending those messages was wrong, but l couldn't stop myself."


Vivian's fingers tightened around his hand.


"Brandon, tell me-what am I supposed to do? If it were you,wouldn't you lose your mind too? I took her suffering, and I couldn't hold myself together. Then came the cancer... how could I not go mad?"


Vivian's sobs were raw, bitter. Brandon's gaze stayed fixed on her, the storm of anger and fear inside him pressing toward the breaking point.


His feelings toward Vivian were no longer clear.


At first, there had simply been relief that Millie was
fine. Later, he cared for her out of pity... and obligation.


Night after night, he'd been wrenched awake by nightmares, only to find calm when Millie lay safe beside him.



He told himself it was over, that Millie had escaped unharmed.



It had been Vivian who went that day.



Since then, Vivian had unraveled-blood on her lips,her health crumbling into cancer. He had known every detail.



The fear had been relentless.


Every time he looked at her suffering,the thought crept in-what if it had been Millie?


Later still, Vivian hovered at death's edge. She came back from treatment in Flaville clutching her medical records. Her words were steady then. She had six months left.
"Brandon, I just want six months. Divorce her and stay with me.Pretend to love me so I can leave with no regrets. Think of it as payment for me taking that secret to my grave. Treat me well, and I'll never speak of it."


The sharp tang of disinfectant hung in the air.Brandon stared at the woman sobbing before him.


He wasn't completely clueless that sometimes her choices were wrong.


Yet he'd always clung to the belief that beneath it all,Vivian was fragile-she wasn't a bad person, and she was just hurt.



He owed her for that day.


Because of that debt, he kept his promise to Vivian-six months, and she would take the secret with her to the grave. Then life would go back to how it used to be.


But now, he finally saw the cost. In these months of chaos,he had wounded Millie again and again.
He had hurt the only woman he truly loved.


And Vivian... she was far from the harmless image she wore.


"Brandon, I was wrong..."


Tears streamed down Vivian's face.


"I'm sorry. I never should have treated her that way.It only happened twice. Once today-because I panicked. The other... that was when my head wasn't right.I...I lost control."


Vivian's fingers wrapped around his, her gaze soft and trembling. "There are only four months left.That's all. When I'm gone, you can still have her."


His gaze stayed fixed on the woman crying before him.


But could there still be a future with Millie?
###Chapter 229 His Words Reassured Her





Brandon's heart ached so fiercely it felt ready to burst.



Looking at Vivian, he didn't even know who deserved the blame.



In the end, it all came back to him.


He blamed himself for thinking he could control everything.



He cursed his ownstupidity.


Brandon let go of Vivian's collar and pulled his hand away from hers.


Without another word, he turned and stumbled toward the door.


"Brandon!" Vivian's voice rang out before he could
reach it.


"You'll still stay with me, won't you? Four months.


You promised. Even if it's just pretend... Even if you only act like you love me... Stay with me, and I won't tell Millie about that incident."


Brandon couldn't help but chuckle. It was a laugh soaked in sorrow and bitterness.


For a moment, he didn't know what to do.


"Brandon, I swear I'll behave. I lost control only those two times-no more. I haven't hurt her since. Please,give me one last chance."


But Brandon said nothing. He only laughed again.


He felt like he was losing his mind.


If he truly went mad, maybe he could break the promise he made to Vivian. Maybe then he could run to Millie and beg her to come back.


Yet, cruelly, he was still painfully clear-headed.
He knew exactly what he had to do.


Eugene knocked on the door before stepping in.


Inside, the air felt strange-thick with tension.


"Is... is everything alright?" he asked.


He'd heard faint arguing outside but couldn't catch the exact words.


"Mr. Watson?" Eugene tried again.


Brandon finally stopped laughing. Drawing all his emotions inward, he looked at Eugene calmly.


Eugene felt a prickle of unease.


"She's ill. Make sure she gets proper treatment,"Brandon said flatly.


Eugene understood. Vivian would finally face the real treatment for the illness she had been faking all along.


Brandon left without another glance.


Vivian let out a quiet breath of relief. In her mind,she
had passed this hurdle.


Brandon could never stomach Millie finding out what happened. For that reason alone, Vivian believed he wouldn't do anything do her.


Without the six-month agreement, he would never have accepted her terms.


But with only four months left, he might still cling to hope that things could return to normal afterwards.That was why he would stick to the deal.


Vivian, however, knew she had to move fast. Four months was all she had to become Mrs.Watson.


She sniffled at the thought, bent down, and picked up her phone from the floor.


Eugene stood nearby.


"Miss Simpson, you're ill and need professional help,"he said.


Vivian blinked at him in confusion.


"I'll arrange the right treatment for your condition.I
hope you'll cooperate," Eugene continued.


He left before she could reply.


Vivian stood still,feeling unsettled.


After a moment, she pulled another phone from under the mattress; slipped out to the balcony, and dialed a number.



The line clicked, and a voice answered. "What's the matter?"



Vivian whispered, "Did you hide well? Was everything from before cleaned up? Brandon won't find out, wil he?"



There was a pause. "Vivian, I've risked everything for you. I set the trap for Brandon, and now I have to run for my life.Yet you still doubt me?"


"It's not like that. It's just... Brandon's been acting strange. He's discovered things. He knows I faked depression. Do you think he'll check my other records from Flaville?" she asked quickly.
She glanced around to make sure no one was watching and lowered her voice further.


"He can't find out about this. Have your friends in Flaville cover it up. After four months, whether it's a miracle or a misdiagnosis, there has to be a reason why I'm still alive."


Silence lingered on the other end.


Vivian softened her tone. "You're the love of my life.Without you, I wouldn't be where I am today.Everything I'm doing now is for our future. And you know... I've never let him touch me. Doesn't that prove it? I love you and only you."


Eventually, the voice replied, "I understand."


She hung up, checked the balcony again to make sure no one heard her, and only then allowed herself to breathe.







Millie was still asleep.
Her dreams dragged her through memories she wished she could forget-her father's death,her stepfather's abuse, Brandon saving her life twice, his betrayal, and the sharp agony of falling down the stairs.



She jolted awake, momentarily unsure of where she was.



"Millie?" a voice called. She turned to see Myron.


"What's wrong?" He hurried to her side, wiped the sweat from her forehead, and helped her sit up.


"Did you have a nightmare?" he asked gently.


Millie's chest tightened. The loss of her child still cut deep.


Tears welled as the memories crashed over her.



"Myron," she whispered.


"I'm right here," he said, voice warm with concern.


Suddenly, she buried her face in his chest and broke into sobs.
For so long, she had worn her strength like armor,pretending nothing could shake her. But she had her own wounds, and she had simply chosen not to share them.



This nightmare had torn down her walls.


Myron didn't know exactly what had happened-only that she was hurting.


He held her close, murmuring quiet reassurances.


In time, she calmed down, lifting her head with a hint of embarrassment.



Myron chuckled softly and brushed away her tears.


"I've cried all over your shirt," she said, noticing the damp patch.


"It's fine," he replied, cupping her face and wiping the last traces of tears.



"It's good to let it out. Millie, I know you've been through so much. But now you have me. Don't carry it all alone from now on. Whatever happens,
remember-I'm here with you. You can trust me completely and lean on me."



His voice was steady and sincere, his touch warm and reassuring.
###Chapter 230 Where The Two Of Them Would Go From Here





Millie's eyes rested on Myron standing before her.


He had always been gentle, respectful, and considerate toward her, never once causing her pain.


That thought eased her heart, and a soft smile appeared on her face.



"Alright," she said, keeping her hands on the ones that were gently holding her cheeks.


The ring on her finger caught the light and gave off a faint sparkle.



The past was behind her now, and now she was Myron's fiancee.



"Have some water," Myron said, pouring a glass and offering it to her.
Millie reached out to take it, letting her gaze drift to the view beyond the window.


"This is the Elliott Group, isn't it?" she asked,glancing around at the small side room connected to his office-a private spot clearly meant for his midday breaks.



"That's right." Myron gave a soft laugh and nodded before moving to the desk where an open stack of documents waited.



It was obvious he'd been in the middle of work before noticing something was wrong and coming straight over.


That awareness brought with it a feeling she wasn't used to.



With her cup in hand, Millie got to her feet and began wandering around the room.


Her past visits here had been brief, always for business, since she usually worked out of her own rented office.
Today was different-she'd fallen asleep in the car,and Myron had carried her here himself.


She stopped in front of the tall floor-to-ceiling window,taking another sip.


It surprised her torealize how long she had slept.


It reminded her of the times Alexia used to joke that she had a perfect sense for falling asleep on subway but waking up right before her stop.



But the truth was, she had never truly slept deeply-only dozed off and on.


Thinking about those days, Millie once again felt the weight of how much time had changed her life.


A knock on the door pulled her from her thoughts,and she turned to see Myron's assistant standing in the doorway with a tray of snacks in hand.


A warm smile crossed the assistant's face as he gave Millie a nod.



"Dinner's almost ready, so Mr. Elliott asked me to just
bring you some light snacks to eat," Mack Stewart,the diligent assistant, explained while setting the tray down on a nearby table.



Millie acknowledged him with a polite. "Thank you."


Returning her smile, Mack gave a small gesture toward Myron before turning to leave the room.



"Go ahead-give them a try," Myron said without looking up from the papers in front of him. "Adriana's been hunting down these treats, thinking they could be added into the package. She and Jayceon? I'm not exactly sold on their cooking, but I'll admit they know where to find good food."



The comment brought to mind the time when Jayceon had tried to make scrambled eggs for them,which turned out to be a total disaster.



A small laugh escaped her as she glanced down at the neatly arranged snacks, which looked far more appealing.


She picked up a piece of pastry and took a bite. It
was actually good.


"This is delicious," Millie said with genuine appreciation.


"Glad to hear it," Myron replied, a faint chuckle in his voice.


Not wanting to disturb him while he worked, she mentioned she might take a walk around the building.


Without looking up, he nodded in approval.


The moment she stepped outside, Mack caught sight of her. "Miss Bennett, would you like me to join you for a tour?"



She shook her head lightly, waving him off to show she was just wandering.



"In that case, I have something for you," Mack said,handing her a leash.


Millie's eyes dropped to it and quickly traced the other end-where a plump orange tabby cat sat patiently.
"Mr. Elliott said you're fond of cats. This is Orange,our company's lucky mascot. It's friendly and likes to roam around. Let it give you a tour," Mack added


Curious, Millie crouched down and gently scratched under the cat's chin.


"Meow!" The cat purred and rubbed its head against Millie's hand.



The thought crossed her mind that Ari would probably adore this cat too.


With a small nod, she accepted the basket of cat treats from Mack. "Alright, thanks."


"Come on, Orange. Show me around," she said to the cat with a faint smile.



"Meow!" it answered before munching on a freeze-dried treat from her palm, and then flicked its tail and walked ahead as if it understood her perfectly.


As they moved through the building, some employees at the Elliott Group either didn't even recognize her, some greeted her with friendly smniles,
occasionally bending down to pet the cat.


Millie let the cat guide her as she wandered about.


The Elliott Group had a warmer, more welcoming atmosphere compared to the Watson Group, which focused heavily on efficiency.


Many areas in the Watson Group had a cold, purely businesslike interior.


Here, each floor of the Elliott Group had its own personality-some leaned toward efficiency, while others felt playful and imaginative.


It was clear the style of each floor reflected the taste of its department head.


Jayceon and Adriana each had their own office and separate floors.


Jayceon rarely came by, preferring to work elsewhere, but Adriana happened to be in that day and greeted Millie.


"Meow!" The cat proudly lifted its head as it led Millie
to another floor.



Millie stepped out of the elevator and found the entire space filled with cat-themed merchandise.


"Orange!" someone called out when they spotted the cat, hurrying over to scoop it into their arms.


"Meow!" Orange purred in delight.


The person looked up at Millie with a smile. "Miss Bennett."



Millie gave a polite nod, curiosity sparking. "What is this place?"


"This little one inspired an entire jewelry collection,"the person responded, holding Orange securely."Come with me, Miss Bennett."


As they walked together, the person continued,"This is Orange's Eye, an emerald."


Her gaze landed on the piece, and the resemblance to the cat was unmistakable.



"This one's shaped like a tail."
"And that's the paw design."







"Now, this charm was modeled after cat testicles-made to look like a pair of playful bells. Of course,Orange doesn't have them anymore since he's been neutered..."


"Meow!" Orange let out a sharp, offended cry


"Alright, alright, I'm sorry," the person said quickly,trying to soothe the cat.


Millie chuckled and handed over a few treats for the employee to give Orange.


The moment Orange appeared, more employees drifted over to join them.


"Our accessories sell really well. Here, Miss Bennett,"one of them said, holding out their phone to show her.


The screen displayed countless photos of pets wearing the products around their necks.
Some people had repurposed them into keychains or bag charms, while others strung several together to create bracelets.



"The cat bell charm is especially a favorite," another employee said with an easy smile.


Millie took her time studying each design, genuinely impressed by their originality.


She lingered there, still looking over the display,when someone stepped into the view.


Lifting her gaze, she saw Myron holding the cat and gently scratching its chin. "We should head out," he said with a small smile. "Charles and the others are already waiting for dinner."


A moment later, he added, "You can take Orange along to play with Ari if you'd like."


Before they left, he clipped a cat bell charm to her bag.


Her eyes lit up as she admired the cute tiny accessory.
"Come on," Myron said. "Let's not keep them waiting."





Glancing out the window, she noticed the sky had deepened into dusk-it really was time to eat.


Over at the restaurant, Charles and Giffard were already seated, with Alexia beside them.


Alexia's eyes moved from Charles to Giffard before a long,quiet sigh escaped her.


Millie said yes to Myron, and now the question hung over them about where the two of them would go from here.
###Chapter 231| Felt Alive Again





Millie and Myron arrived with Ari just as night had fully settled.


Ari clutched the cat, pressing her forehead to its soft fur in a playful game. Her large, round eyes sparkled with affection.



Myron carried Ari as he walked beside Millie.


The moment they stepped inside, conversations briefly paused.


The three of them-with the cat in tow-looked every bit like a picture-perfect family.


A faint shadow crossed Giffard's eyes, gone almost as soon as it appeared, hidden behind his usual calm.


Charles, on the other hand, smiled lightly. "Ari, don't you like me anymore? You didn't run over to me like before."
Myron chuckled, setting Ari down and gently patting her head.


Still hugging the cat, Ari skipped over.


"Look, this is Orange!" she said, holding the cat toward Charles.


Before he could respond, the cat reached out and pressed a paw to his face, as if turning him down.


Laughter rippled around the room, breaking the earlier tension.


The mood warmed, and dinner carried on as usual.


Charles raised his glass in a toast to Millie's latest success.


"The tide's turning online. People are demanding answers from Vivian, and she's still silent. Her reputation may not survive this."


"What she did was vile!" Alexia burst out.


The others joined in condemning Vivian's recent live stream.
Millie felt a quiet warmth in her chest.


These friends stood by her through everything. She hoped they would stay this way forever.


Halfway through the meal, Millie excused herself to the restroom.



When she returned, Charles stood in the hallway,looking torn.


"What's the matter, Charles?" she asked.



He led her to the far end of the corridor.



Under the soft lights, the wind stirred the leaves outside the window. Charles' face, as striking as ever,was calm but unreadable.


"You really like Myron? And it's not just to get away from Brandon or for some other reason?" he asked quietly.


Millie's lips pressed together.


The day had come-this was a talk she knew she couldn't avoid.
"Hard to answer?" he asked when she stayed silent.



She shook her head. "No. I'm just thinking of how to put it."


Charles smiled faintly. "What's there to fear? I don't bite."



She thought about it. For all his temper, Charles wasn't really frightening. She knew that he was really a good man.



Her shoulders eased. She met his gaze and spoke firmly. "Yes, I like him."


His smile faltered for a moment, but he quickly masked it. "Really?"


Her eyes didn't waver. "Yeah, really. Charles, the old me died the night I was pushed down the stairs. I'm not that woman anymore."



Her voice held no hint of a smile. This was something that had to be said clearly, leaving no space for false hope.
"I've long let go of Brandon," she continued."Liking Myron came after-it's separate from all that."


"You fell for him just because of those few dates?"he asked with a frown.


"Yes. Because of those dates."


Charles looked like he had more to say, but the words never came.


Millie sighed. "For seven years, I was tired and numb.I thought I couldn't love anymore. Then he came along-patient, careful-and somehow, I felt alive again."


Charles no longer looked playful. His eyes were shaded with something closer to sadness.


"Charles," she said softly, but stopped there.


They simply looked at each other until Charles gave a small,resigned smile.


"Alright," he said with a nod.


She let out a breath she hadn't realized she was
holding.


Charles' gaze shifted past her.


She turned and saw Giffard standing quietly behind.


He walked over, giving Millie's shoulder a gentle pat before looking at Charles. The two men exchanged a silent glance.


"Next week, the Watson Group launches their new product. Oakley might use the chance to sell those stocks he holds. My people will boe watching.Once the funds circle back, we'll have proof," Charles changed the subject and looked at Millie.


Charles reminded himself not to think too far ahead.Working with Millie already gave him the upper hand in his family's feud. Wishing for more would be greedy.


Since she had someone she liked, he should offer his blessings.


Giffard let out a quiet sigh. "The international seminar in Flaville is coming up. I'll use it to look
deeper into Vivian."


"Thank you, Giffard. I know it's a lot to ask," Millie said.



"It's nothing. Don't mention it." Giffard smiled.


She knew it wasn't easy, and she knew he helped because he cared for her.



But to her, he was just like her big brother-and she had told him so.



If he'd overheard her conversation with Charles,there was nothing more to say.


She left them to talk and went back inside.



There, Myron was feeding Ari with the ease of a seasoned father.


Hearing her, he glanced over, his eyes saying more than his words.



"You're back?" Myron asked.


"Yeah." Millie nodded.
They exchanged a silent understanding.


Across the table, Alexia sighed.


It was clear her brother had no chance.


Dinner wrapped up soon after.


Before heading home, Myron took Millie and Ari to the rooftop garden.


Ari still held the cat tight.


Myron placed her gently on the swing chair,and then took Millie's hand.


"I've been planning this for a while. Now it's finally time," he said.



"What is it?" she asked, curious.


He turned to Ari. "Hold the cat tight-there might be some noise."


"Okay!" Ari grinned, her eyes sparkling. She already knew, as Myron had told her during dinner.


Millie glanced between them, puzzled, when
suddenly, a swarm of drones lifted into the night sky,their lights glittering above.
###Chapter 232 Please, Wait For Me




A quick glance from Millie revealed the drones shifting into position, slowly shaping themselves into a massive ring in the sky.



Beneath that glowing loop, more drones flickered to life, sketching the delicate outline of a woman's smiling profile.


Fireworks burst to life, their flames unfurling from the outer edge of the ring.


They came in brilliant shades of white and blue,flaring like shimmering tassels across the dark canvas above. Wisps of smoke drifted over the woman's image, giving her the illusion of a gauzy veil -mysterious, breathtaking, and alive with light.


A rush of sound followed as streaks of color shot up from the ground, exploding in dazzling blooms that framed the veiled face in the sky.
From every corner of the city, more fireworks joined the spectacle.


Each sharp boom echoed across Crobert, rolling over rooftops and streets alike.


Against the night, the skyline was awash with color,and the drones kept climbing, painting intricate,shifting designs that felt both futuristic and otherworldly.


Never before had Crobert witnessed such a show.Not even the fireworks from Brandon and Millie's wedding could compare.


The entire horizon shimmered.


From sidewalks to balconies, people tilted their heads toward the sky, murmuring in awe, their phones raised to capture the magic before it faded.


Farther away, Charles steered his car down the road,catching glimpses of the spectacle in his windshield before glancing toward the rooftop garden.


A sudden vibration in his pocket pulled him from
view.



"Interested in discussing a collaboration?" the message read.



Jayceon's name flashed on the screen.


Charles hesitated, his fingers still.


Another message appeared. "My brother wanted me to reach out. You have nothing to worry about-our families have plenty in common, and we'd work well together. Among your brothers, you have our full support."


A faint, wry smile touched Charles' lips.


So this was Myron's plan to keep him quiet? To stop him from ever telling Millie how he felt?


It was really unnecessary, though. For Charles Millie's happiness mattered more than anything-and he'd do whatever it took< to protect it.



The idea of discussing a partnership didn't seemn half bad.
Turning down a solid business opportunity would be pure foolishness.


With that in mind, Charles typed a reply to Jayceon before steering his car into a U-turn.


Meanwhile, the car carrying Alexia and Giffard eased away from its spot and rolled onto the road.


With Giffard at the wheel, the glow of the traffic light ahead shifted to red, forcing the car to slow.


From the passenger seat, Alexia's gaze drifted between the fireworks bursting above and the man beside her.



"Giffard," Alexia said softly,a trace of worry in her tone.



"What is it?" he answered without glancing over.



A long breath escaped her before she finally voiced her thoughts. "It looks like Millie and Myron are serious now. You..."



"I'll be in Flaville next weekend for the seminar." His
voice cut in, ending her sentence before it coud finish.





Her lips parted again, but no convincing words came.


"Relax." Giffard kept his attention fixed on the glowing night sky ahead.


"This trip has been on my calendar for a while. It's not changing. And about Millie-I'll take care of it."


All Alexia could do was shake her head.


이 know exactly what you're trying to say." The light turned green, and the car moved forward. "But even if it's just because v/e grew up together and she's always treated me like family, I still have to do this."


Once he dealt with things, Millie's happiness-and whoever she chose to share it with-would be entirely her own decision.


"Alright." Alexia gave a small nod.


Still watching the glittering display above, she asked,"Will you still cook for her?"
Millie might have thought their household had hired a new chef,but the truth was, Giffard had been the one who cooked her those dishes all along.


"You're overthinking, silly girl." Giffard's chuckle was warm. "Even if things between her and me don't work out, it's not like we will stop being friends. I'm not that childish."


Hearing that, Alexia finally let out the breath she'd been holding, though a touch of embarrassment lingered on her face.


Without another word, Giffard reached over to ruffle her hair before returning his focus to the road.


Above them, the sky kept bursting into color. Inside a suite at the international hotel, Egbert cradled a glass of red wine, the amber light glinting off a small wooden fox sculpture resting on the table nearby.


Earlier, he had caught the live broadcast and learned that Millie had accepted Myron's proposal.


A faint, helpless smile touched his lips at the
memory.



"Just a little late in coming back, and I've already missed everything," he murmured to himself. "Millie...are you certain this is the right choice? Is he really the one for you? And me... who will be the one for me?"







Meanwhile, on the rooftop garden, the night unfolded in dazzling color. In Millie's eyes, the reflection of drones and fireworks shimmered, rising and falling over the cityscape.


Her gaze followed the veil-like bursts that drifted over the woman's profile in the sky, the glowing blooms in the distance, and the ring brought forth by the great whale display.


Then came a sight that made her breath hitch-her own name spelled out against the vast night sky.


"Is that... me?" Millie's voice was barely above a whisper.
Myron gave a slow nod, his hand reaching for hers.


"As I've always wanted," he said. "Millie, I want to take away everything that man ever did to hurt you.Every scar he left-I'll heal it."


His fingers closed firmly around hers, holding on with a strength that left no room for doubt.


"From this night forward, whenever you see fireworks or a ring, let it remind you of this moment. And when you think of the one you love, know that it's me."


For the first time, there was something fiercely possessive in his tone.



Millie tore her gaze away from the fireworks and focused on him instead.



In those slightly reddened eyes, her own reflection shimmered back at her from the depths of his pupils.


A small flutter stirred in her chest.


Memories returned of the day he had taken her to that chamber, showing her all the paintings as if
revealing a piece of his soul.


He had loved her for so many years, and his patience had matched that devotion.


Heat welled in her eyes, and she let a soft smile form.


"Alright," she said quietly.


Myron's own lips curved, though his eyes glistened.He drew her closer, unable to look at anything but her.


After swallowing the lump in his throat, he cupped her head and pressed his lips to hers.


This was not a gentle kiss.


It came with an urgency that stole her breath, his arms locking around her as though he meant to fuse her into himself.


Overhead, the fireworks roared and scattered in brilliant bursts, but Millie no longer knew where she V/as.



The only things she felt were the heat of his body
and the searing warmth of his breath.


Far below, in the street, Brandon sat behind the wheel of his car, looking up at the night sky-and at the couple locked in that kiss. Every fiber in him wanted to break them apart.


Vivian's voice echoed in his mind, holding him back.


The promise he had made kept him in place, hoping she would never speak of the past again.


His grip on the steering wheel tightened until his knuckles blanched, the ache in his chest nearly unbearable. Pulling out his phone, he opened Millie's chat.



"I'll hand over the Bennett family's assets without question. I'll uncover the truth about your father's death. I'll treat you right, Millie. Don't choose him,don't get engaged to him. Please...wait for me."
###Chapter 233 We Will Both Be Happy





Brandon pressed send.


Unlike before when his messages disappeared without a reply, something happened immediately.


It hadn't gone through.


He stared at it in disbelief.



Had Millie blocked him?


He could hardly believe it. Even after they separated,he had always been able to reach her.


He had assumed that as long as he controlled the Bennett family's assets, she would hesitate. She would have to contact him eventually.


But now...



When had she blocked him?



He had no idea.
He reached for the car door, ready to go upstairs and find her.



The moment Brandon opened it, he froze.


Not far away, Myron's men stood watching.When they caught his eye, they smiled and nodded.







In the rooftop garden, Myron finally/eased his hold on Millie.



He rested his forehead against hers, closing his eyes as if to steady himself. A brief swallow betrayed thoughts he kept to himself. He bit her lower lip lightly, and then smiled.


Millie blushed and gave him a sharp look.


"Ari is still here," she said.


"I didn't see anything," Ari replied. "I'm playing with Orange."



Millie grew more flustered and pushed at Myron.
He chuckled and then let her go.


She went straight to the swing where Ari sat.


Ari hugged Orange while feeding it freeze-dried treats.



Her short legs dangled above the ground. She had been there for a while. When she saw Millie, she called out, "Push the swing!"


Millie nodded and gave it a gentle push.


Orange snuggled closer to Ari. Sensing no danger,it peeked out again to steal another treat, making Ari giggle.


Millie couldn't help but smile.


"Greedy Orange," she teased.


Ari nodded, agreeing.


Millie glanced at her handbag. She thought of showing Ari the trinket hanging from it, though she wasn't sure Ari would understand its meaning.
Before she could decide, a large hand appeared with a small cat ornament.


"Here," Myron said, handing it to Ari.


The little girl's eyes lit up.


"Wow, it's Orange!" She compared the ornament with the real cat in her arms.



"I picked it up from the company earlier," Myron said."| thought you'd like it."


Millie continued to push the swing, finding herself more and more fond of Ari.



Myron stood beside them, watching. He felt a rare and quiet contentment.


He reached out to steady the swing and gave it a gentle push. "The paperwork has been approved," he told Ari. "The adoption procedures will be done in about a week. Ari, how about you and Millie move in with me then? We have koi in the pond, Kiki at home,drivers, a nice housekeeper, and a family doctor. It will be easier for us to take care of you."
Ari's face lit up, but she looked to Millie before answering.


Millie nodded.


Ari grinned, showing her small teeth.


"Okay. Can I bring Orange to play with Kiki?"


"Of course," Myron said, reaching out to stroke Orange.


Millie watched them and felt her heart warm.



It was simple happiness.


It felt like home.


Fireworks still burst overhead, filling the night for a long time.


The show would be remembered by many for a very long time, no doubt about it.


People began guessing its purpose.


Later, word spread that it had been arranged by the Elliott family-more specifically, Myron.
Once Myron's successful proposal made the news,the connection was obovious.


"Myron is trying to outdo Brandon. When Brandon married Millie, he set off fireworks. Now Myron wants an even bigger show."


"I love it. Let them keep competing. I want more fireworks and more free shows."



"Are you daydreaming?"


"I don't care about them. I want to know why Vivian hasn't responded yet."


"Yeah, it's basically confirmed she entered Brandon and Millie's old home without permission and live-streamed it. She used to be loud online. Now she's silent."



The debate online continued.



Some discussed Myron and Brandon competition while others called for Vivian to apoologize.


Meanwhile, the fireworks ended.
The drones flew off, and Myron drove Millie and Ari home.


When they stepped out of the car, Ari took Millie's hand and led her toward a corner.


Sensing the moment, Myron lingered by the car,pretending to tidy things inside.


Ari stopped by a small tree and looked up at Millie.


"Millie, is Myron your boyfriend now?" she asked.


Millie crouched so their eyes met."Yes."


"Will you get married?" Ari blinked.


"I don't know yet," Millie said with a smile, "but l've agreed to his proposal. He's my fiance now."


Ari tilted her head,puzzled.


"It means that if everything goes well, we'll get married," Millie explained.


Ari nodded, and then suddenly hugged her.


Millie held her, unsure at first why Ari was being so
affectionate.


Then Ari lifted her face. Millie smiled at her adorable little face.



They had both been abandoned once.


Ari had told her before that her parents left her, but she was lucky to meet Millie. She had said that when Millie left Brandon, she too would find someone better.



"Millie, we'll both be happy," Ari said with a wide smile.


Millie smiled and hugged her tightly. "Yes. We'll both be happy."







Millie feIt grateful.


Everything seemed to be falling into place. The new jewelry collection had been a success. She had let go of the past. She was engaged to Myron. Ari's adoption procedures were almost complete.
Life was moving forward.


Millie slept soundly that night.


The next morning, she had barely gotten out of bed when her phone rang.


"Millie, come to Watson Group," Derek said. "There are points in the agreement that need to be discussed and revised. Brandon and Vivian are already here."


Millie's heart tightened.


Derek had always treated her well because she was once Brandon's wife.



Now she had accepted Myron's proposal in public.Would that change everything?
###Chapter 234 Love Of Vivian Successfully Hitting Theaters




"Alright," Millie said before ending the call. She quickly freshened up, picked up the original agreement, and rushed out the door.



She took a taxi and on the way, she called Myron,asking if he could take Ari to kindergarten.


"Is everything okay?" Myron asked as he stood up to go get Ari.


"Derek needs me for something," Millie explained.

"I'm on my way to the Watson Group."


"I'll come pick you up later," he said.


Millie's gaze stayed on the road ahead. "Alright."







Meanwhile, at the Watson Group, Derek, Norma,
Brandon and Vivian were all present.


Each of their faces bore a different countenance.



The elderly pair looked exhausted, like they'd had no sleep.


Derek occasionally shot a glare at Brandon, each glance filled with disapproval.


Brandon, on the other hand, sat with an air of composure, his face giving away nothing.


Vivian kept her gaze lowered, lost in thought,loosely holding a different phone.


She had claimed her old one was broken, a subtle way of guarding against Brandon taking it from her again.


Suddenly, her phone buzzed.


She looked at the screen.



"Love of Vivian has completed all the procedures needed for its theaterrelease."
m0
Relieved,she leaned back slightly.


The process had begun back during the Heavenly Melody show was still ongoing and had dragged on for quite some time. In that span, she had exhausted various means and leveraged the Watson Group's connections to push things along more quickly.


Now that it was complete, a sense of relief washed over her.



Her yesterday's live stream at Serenity Villa had been exposed as a forced entry, but she hadn't addressed it, taking her time until she could find a way to turn everything around.


Even if she had to give up live streaming, she believed that as long as Love of Vivian sold well, she would still come out on top.


With that thought, her mood lightened. Earlier today,Derek and Norma had unexpectedly called for both her and Millie. They hadn't explained the reason yet,but she was sure that since Millie was no longer part of the Watson family, and Derek would never stand
by her side.


Time ticked by slowly. Eventually, Eugene knocked on the door.



"Miss Bennett is here," he announced at the door.


Derek's eyes swept over Brandon's unreadable face before he told Eugene, "Let her in."


The sharp click of heels drew closer as Millie stepped inside.


Right away, she sensed the tension in the room,most noticeably from Brandon, whose eyes held a mix of emotions she couldn't quite read.


Choosing not to dwell on it, she greeted Derek and Norma with a polite nod.


Derek and Norma looked at each other and sighed deeply.


"We've called you here today to discuss an issue,"Derek began once Eugene had shut the office door behind him.
Millie stayed silent, listening closely.


"We haven't been feeling well lately, and our energy isn't what it used to be. So we want to shorten the agreement period. Three months is too long, we'd like to make it two. What do you think?" His gaze shifted from Millie to Vivian.



Since one month had already passed, cutting it down to two would mean only a month was left.


Vivian felt as though fortune was smiling on her.


Love of Vivian was going to theaters, and soon it could be set for an official release. Vivian also knew Millie was counting on the Elliott Group's jewelry collection to win.



According to the original schedule the Elliott Group released, three months were required in total. Cutting it short now would mean skipping two rounds of new product launches, which would make it no match for Love of Vivian's momentum.



With that in mind, Vivian gave a small nod. "I'm fine
with that."



Millie's brow furrowed as she looked at Derek and Norma.



This outcome was actually better than some of the scenarios she had imagined on her way there.


At the very least, the contest between them wasn't over yet. It still gave her a path to win back the Bennett family's possessions through this agreement.


However, her approach would need a few careful adjustments.


Millie's eyes briefly met Vivian's.


Catching her gaze, Vivian smiled.


"Millie, I think it makes sense. They do need proper rest. What do you think?"


Vivian recalled the trouble she had faced from Charles' people while handling the theater procedures. It seemed Millie really was concerned
about Love of Vivian making it to the big screen.


The more she thought about it, the more certain she became of her advantage.


Meanwhile, Derek and Norma shared another look.Their real reason for wanting to shorten the period was to bring this standoff to an end as quickly as possible.


After hearing Millie accept Myron's engagement proposal the previous day, they felt they couldn't afford to wait any longer.


If they should wait two more months, Millie and Myron might even get married.


Cutting the period by a month was the outcome of careful discussion.



The formal agreement was already signed, and any change required everyone's consent. If they tried to shorten it too much, Millie might reject the proposal.


One month was the furthest they felt they could push without risking her refusal.
With just that month left, Millie would have far less time, leaving her no chance to plan the wedding with Myron.


With this thought, Derek gave a deliberate, faint cough, making himself appear frail.


"Millie, what do you think?" he asked.


Millie looked at the elderly couple for a moment before finally giving a nod.


"Alright, I agree," Millie said. "But on one condition."


Seeing events unfold exactly as she'd anticipated,Vivian felt a quiet satisfaction and began, "Millie,you..."


"The condition is that this agreement cannot be altered again after this," Millie cut in before Vivian could finish.



"Alright." Derek coughed slightly, and then called Eugene back into the room.


Eugene returned holding the supplementary
agreement.


"You should go over it," Derek said.


Millie read through it with care. The terms were simple. It was just a mutual consent to modify the timeline, with no hidden clauses.


Satisfied, she signed her name and then handed it to Vivian for her signature.


"Alright," Millie said, holding the supplementary agreement as her eyes moved to Derek and Norma."I'll be on my way now."


There was nothing more she needed to say to them.


She only hoped they would take care of themselves.


With that, she turned to leave, not once glancing at Brandon who was seated nearby.


From start to finish, Brandon stayed silent. He neither opposed the change nor let any emotion show on his face.



He kept that composure the entire time.
Only when Millie was walking away did he lift his head,his gaze following her retreating figure.


"Brandon," Vivian's voice called from beside him.


Brandon drew his eyes back and looked at her.


Vivian's lips curved into a smile. "There's now one less mnonth until | officially become part of the Watson family. Does that make you happy?"


Brandon gave no reply. Instead, he lifted his gaze to the sky beyond the tall floor-to-ceiling window,watching the clouds drift lazily by, deep in thought.


Vivian watched Brandon's profile, her smile deepening.




In just one month, she would be married to Brandon and bound to him as his wife. And when that day came, he would never be able to break free from her.
###Chapter 235 Not Bright But Truly Sincere





Vivian kept the contract in hand, her smile deepening as satisfaction lit her face.



It was, without question, an advantageous deal.


While she basked in her victory upstairs, Millie had already stepped out of the building and made her way to the ground floor.


Myron's car was parked outside the building at the curb. The moment he spotted her, a quick honk announced his presence before he swung the door open and stepped out.


Relief washed over his features the instant he confirmed she was unharmed.



"Everything okay?" he inquired gently, pulling the door wide for her.
"'m fine," Millie assured him, sliding into the seat. As soon as he settled behind the wheel, she passed him the supplementary agreement."They only moved the deadline up."


Myron skimmed the document, gave a curt nod, and turned the key in the ignition.


"So," he said, keeping his eyes on the road."What are you planning to do next?"


The new product line obviously needed more than the month she had.



Millie let out a soft laugh, leaning in to murmur something only he could hear.


Myron's brow arched in mild surprise. "So, this is what you've been working toward all along?"


Millie gave a firm nod. "That's right. The process was already in motion-we just need to speed things up given the tighter schedule. Take me to Evans Entertainment," she insisted, her gaze fixed on the road ahead.
Without hesitation, Myron swung the car into a turn,steering down a different route.


"Last night, I had Jayceon contact Charles to propose a collaboration. Would that bother you?" he queried, glancing her way.


"Not at all," she responded, catching on immediately to his intent. "Charles is remarkably shrewd-he won't pass up a good business deal."


A chuckle rumbled from Myron's chest as he nodded. "Exactly. Jayceon told me Charles swore he'd never turn down profit."


Millie laughed softly, shaking her head.


That was so very Charles-always handling things in his own distinctive way.


Myron treated her to breakfast first before steering the car toward Evans Entertainment.


While she sat down with Charles to go over the details of their business, Vivian was busy launching a live stream of her own.
It was her first public move after yesterday's abrupt cutoff of her previous broadcast-and the exposure of her sneaking into Serenity Villa without permission.


The moment she went live, the viewers poured in like a tidal wave.



Comments flooded the screen, sharp and unforgiving.





"Why in the world would you stream Millie's private matters for all to watch yesterday?"


"Vivian, you're utterly shameless! You'll do anything to claw your way to the top!"


"I was dead wrong about you1. I actually thought you had a shred of kindness in you-guess I was blind as hell!"


A moment later, Vivian reappeared on the camera frame,her complexion even paler than before.


A faint cough slipped past her lips as she dabbed at her mouth with a tissue, her bandaged hand
trembling slightly.


Lowering the tissue, she drew in a steadying breath.


"Sorry... I wasn't feeling well yesterday," she said, her voice tinged with weakness. "And had to see a doctor, so l couldn't respond right away."


She offered the camera a feeble, almost fragile smile,nodding repeatedly as her gaze tracked the flood of incoming comments.


"I've read what you've all said," she murmured,her reddened eyes glistening as if holding back tears. "I truly apologize-l didn't handle things properly."


Pausing for only a heartbeat, she straightened her shoulders. "First of all, I admit I entered Serenity Villa to livestream without permission."


With that, Vivian rose to her feet and bent forward in a deep, deliberate bow toward the lens.


The comments poured in even faster now that she had confessed, the barrage of words serving as irrefutable proof in the eyes of her audience.
Shameless-that was the verdict scrolling endlessly across the screen.



"But there's a reason you didn't expect," Vivian pointed out, her tone tight but controlled. "I know it's useless to say this now, but I still want to explain.I had originally announced another location, but on that day, the pipes there suddenly burst and the whole place was flooded. It was impossible to stream from the mess. I didn't want to postpone,so l went to a different location instead..."


As she spoke, she signaled her assistant, who hurried forward with a tablet and played footage from Darden's villa.



The video captured frantic voices after the burst, the camera panning over water flooding every corner.


"It truly was an emergency I handled poorly," Vivian admitted, lowering her head in another deep,deliberate bow.



"Brandon was away on a business trip that day, and I couldn't get through to him. I just... happened to
know the password to that villa, sol..."


Some viewers softened at her words, blaming her only for her clumsy handling and calling her careless rather than malicious.


Others, however, weren't swayed in the slightest.


"So you actually thought it was fine to hurt Millie like that? You knew livestreaming that would drag her name through the mud, but you still went ahead!"


Vivian's shoulders slumped, a trace of defeat clouding her expression.


"That wasn't what I meant to do," she murmured, her voice trembling. "I... I wasn't thinking straight in that moment. I can't even explain it properly. If l absolutely have to make amends,then..."


Vivianfaced the camera with a solemn expression."I'll be suspending my floral design work in luxury villas. My career will go on hold so lI can make amends to Millie and properly address this matter.I've been competing with her for the chance to marry
Brandon, but now I'm making a major sacrifice to prove my sincerity."


Her voice broke as another fit of coughing racked her, the sound rough and wet until it tipped into dry heaves.



A pair of hands rushed in from the side to steady her.An urgent voice, just off-screen, warned, "Miss Simpson, I've told you-your time is already running out. If you keep overworking, you might not even have four months left to live!"



Vivian simply waved them away, insisting they let her finish.



The comment feed exploded.


Some applauded her decision to halt her career,praising her humility. Others admired her willingness to own her mistakes. Many expressed pity, moved by the revelation that she was staring down death itself.


No matter their stance, one sentiment gained traction-her image had taken a turn for the better.

The phrase surged to the top of the trending list.


At the same time, headlines announced that Love of Vivian had officially secured a cinema release and was merely waiting for its premiere date.


Vivian later flooded her socials with updates, hyping up Love of Vivian.


Over at Evans Entertainment, Charles nearly blew up when he saw it.


"Isn't that supposed to be my tagline? How the hell did it become part of her persona?" he demanded,slamming his palm against the desk with a sharp crack.



The theft of his image filled him with burning fury.


Millie chuckled, eyes sparkling with mischief. "So you're finally admitting you're not exactly a genius?"


"You!" Charles shot her a glare, his irritation spiking.


His temper flared hot enough to make the veins in his
neck stand out.


Millie lifted a hand in mock surrender, the hint of a smile playing on her lips. She was only teasing. In truth, she knew he was sharp as a blade-just sly enough to make people mistake him for a fool.


That earned a smug nod from Charles. "You're right."


The compliment soothed his ego, and he eased back into his seat. "Still, she's unbelievable. I know Darden, and just yesterday I heard him going off-sarcastically hinting someone sabotaged his pipes.Vivian planned it from the start. She wanted that broadcast location, and now she's spinning excuses,pretending she's meeting you halfway. Meanwhile,you're the one who looks like the aggressor."


He shook his head in disgust. "I've never met anyone this damn shameless."



Millie's lips curled in a cold smile. It was exactly as he said.



They'd just watched the livestream together, and
Vivian's performance was transparent-her entire broadcast boiled down to a carefully packaged confession and an apology, the kind meant to win sympathy, not to take real responsibility.


"So, what's our next move?" Charles pressed, stil seething from his earlier outburst.


"I need a concert," Millie declared with unwavering resolve, drumming her fingers on the table as a glint of strategy lit her eyes.


Charles gave a firm nod, signaling he was on the same page. The groundwork had already been laid earlier. They'd talked before about moving in tandem with the Elliott Group-aligning it with Millie's concert, song sales, and other ventures, pushing forward on several fronts at once.



"We need to push through a schedule change immediately," Millie instructed, sliding the supplementary agreement fromn her folder.



"And then there's Eva," she went on, her voice turning icy.
Her gaze shifted to the tablet resting nearby, where Vivian's latest promotional post for Love of Vivian glared back at her.


Vivian clearly had no intention of backing down on the film's release.


If that was her choice, she had no right to complain about what came next.


Millie's lips curved faintly, her tone laced with resolve. "It's time to settle every score-one at a time."
###Chapter 236 Confuse The Opponents




Charles clasped his hands together, a glint of anticipation in his eyes.


At last, the chance to bring Vivian down was within reach.



Her recent antics had left him irritated.


As for Oakley, all they needed was that last bit of proof.


Very soon, everything would line up perfectly.


Both of them kept going over the finer points as the hours crept by.


By afternoon, Vivian moved on to the next stage of her promotions.


Across towering billboards, new clips from Love of
Vivian flashed brightly, each one tagged with the announcement that the premiere was only a week away.


Ordinarily, locking in a movie's schedule meant lengthy negotiations, but Vivian had leaned directly on Brandon's network.



Prime advertising slots were usually claimed months in advance and someone might have booked them already, yet somehow, every major billboard now carried Love of Vivian's banners.



The sudden takeover sent the Internet into a frenzy.






Watson.Group headquarters, top floor, CEO's office.


Brandon stood by the massive floor-to-ceiling window, his eyes on the endless traffic far below.


The click of high heels drew closer, and Vivian stopped beside him.


"Thanks, Brandon." She smiled warmly.
Though the Watson Group had stepped back from Love of Vivian, she was now relying on Brandon's personal influence, something that was proving incredibly effective.


She even intended, once Love of Vivian premiered, to push for all Watson Group employees to buy a ticket,presenting it as a company benefit.


Brandon didn't glance her way. For the past few days, he had been this way, no longer quick-tempered, but calm and silent.


He said nothing to her, watching the clouds drift past, his thoughts clearly elsewhere.


Vivian studied the sharp lines of his face, a trace of irritation tugging at her expression before she smoothed it away.


Why bother with his coldness? A month from now,he would still end up marrying her.


The thought drew another smile from her.


Everything was right where she wanted it.
That evening, Vivian went live on her streaming channel.


With the heavy wave of promotion behind her, the moment her stream began, viewers flooded in by the thousands.



She leaned closer to the camera, smiling.


"Hello, everyone," she said warmly. "I've seen your messages. Yes, Love of Vivian hits theaters in just one week. I've planned something simple for tonight's stream. We'll keep it relaxed, just talking about things connected to Love of Vivian."


Vivian then began telling the story behind the song Glimmer of Love, a tale she had touched on before during Heavenly Melody.


A number of her fans had been with her since her illness, and hearing this again stirred up old memories.



"This song reflects what I went through back then-
the pain, the despair of hearing I had little time left,the fight to keep going, and the choice to use what time I had to help others facing the same fate..."


Vivian spoke quietly, and then began to hum Glimmer of Love into the microphone.


The stream itself was short, and once it ended, she immediately uploaded a new video.


"With only four months left, I'm stepping into the spotlight for my very first film production."


The video leaned heavily on her looming death, tying it to the original reason she wrote Glimmer of Love. It touched on her love, her grief, the hopelessness she once felt, and the empathy she gained in those moments, along with her determination to give strength to others in similar situations.


It connected Love of Vivian to Glimmer of Love so tightly.


Within hours, the video shot to the top of the trending list.
#VivianSimpsonLoveofVivian



The hashtag dominated the number one spot, with comments flooding in beneath it.


Vivian watched it all unfold, knowing it was only part of theplan. She sent a quick message to Johnny.


He understood immediately, instructing his team to move fast.



Not long after, another post surfaced online,one that laid out the things Vivian had done since learning her time was short.



Her live streams chronicled life with a terminal illness and were meant to give strength to fellow patients.


Her participation in Heavenly Melody proved that even with death on the horizon, life could still have a meaning.


Her appearances at the charity gala raised awareness for sick children, showing her generosity and compassion.
The video went further, listing other moments from her journey, each paired with clips and emphasized by the gentle notes of Glimmer of Love. It left countless viewers in tears.



"She's incredible. In her place, I would've thrown in the towel... maybe even given up on life."


"I saw her collapse more than once because of her condition."


"Still, that doesn't make up for how she treated Millie. That live stream at Serenity Villa was downright vile!"


"Hey, Vivian already apologized and even canceled the luxury villa floral design project. What else do you want? Want her dead?"



"Exactly! That was an accident. A pipe burst at the original location. Sure, she didn't handle it well, but she's apologized sincerely! She knows she messed up and has taken responsibility!"


The arguments online raged on, but most of the
noise was carefully steered by Johnny's team.


With Vivian having apologized and dropped the project, any critic was quickly silenced with the talk of Vivian's apology.



She had already said she was sorry; what more could anyone demand? Did they want her gone entirely?


That refrain echoed across the Internet.



The debates fizzled out as most people lost interest,leaving paid trolls to flood nearly every post.


Charles scrolled through the chaos, shaking his head in disbelief.


"Honestly, Vivian's a genius at spinning publicity," he remarked, throwing a glance at Millie, who was in the middle of discussing countermeasures with Seville.


Seville looked up. "How about giving me some credit,boss? I've been the one keeping her off balance."


And it was true. Seville had been crafting the perfect illusion for Vivian-the constant opposition that never
managed to beat her.


Even the so-called disruption to Love of Vivian's release was part of the ruse.


It was all worked out after Millie sat down with them.


"If we just sit on our hands, she'll start wondering what we're up to. So we make a little noise, enough to look weak, while letting her believe she's in control. People who think they hold all the cards tend to miss the traps right in front of them."


That was Millie's strategy.


As timing was everything, they needed to control it.


This was, in truth, the last chance Millie was willing to give Vivian.


While Charles and Seville exchanged jabs, Millie's phone buzzed.


She checked the screen, it was a call to Eva's number.





Stepping away from the table, Millie answered the
call, her voice low and rough. "Who's this?"



"You know exactly who's calling." It was Vivian's voice. "I want to talk. Tell me where you are."



Millie checked the time. It was 7:30 in the evening.



"Evans Entertainment," she said.
###Chapter 237 The Premiere Of Love Of Vivian








Millie met Vivian in the lounge of Evans Entertainment at half past eight in the evening.


A car was parked outside. Millie noticed Brandon behind the wheel.



He didn't step out. Instead, Vivian got out and made her way into the Evans Entertainment building alone.


Millie glanced at her reflection in the glass.


Her face looked nothing like itself-one half pulled in the opposite direction, her features transformed by special effects makeup.


Dressed in a bizarre costume, her figure hidden, she was completely unrecognizable.


She waited for the elevator doors to open, eyes on the spot where Vivian would appear.
When Vivian stepped out and saw her, she paused.


"Eva?" Vivian asked, frowning.


"Yeah." Millie's voice was rough. "What do you want?I'm busy," she said, gesturing towards her makeup.


Vivian recalled seeing others in similar makeup and costume on her way up.



It didn't surprise her-Eva was an artist under Evans Entertainment. Perhaps there was a last-minute music video shoot and she had to fillin.



"Let's talk somewhere else," Vivian suggested,glancing around.


Vivian had learnt her lessons about hidden recorders.She preferred to pick the spot herself.



Millie caught her meaning and followed her to a quiet corner.



Vivian checked the surroundings, and then fixed her eyes on Millie's altered face. A smug smile curved her lips.
"Love of Vivian is about to premiere. I'm here to give you one last chance. Keep quiet, drag Evans Entertainment down, and I'll make it worth your while.Watson Group will cover your penalty and push you into the spotlight. With your talent and their backing you'll be famous in no time," she said.


Millie stared at her, her expression unreadable.


"This is the third time you've come to me," she rasped.


"And the third time I'm offering you a chance," Vivian said with certainty.


"The final one?" Millie asked, tilting her head.


Vivian's smile deepened."The final one."


They held each other's gaze until Millie suddenly laughed.


Did Vivian really think she was doing her a favor?


To Millie, it was the other way around.


No matter how pretty the packaging, a lie stayed a
lie.



"What's so funny?" Vivian snapped.


Millie's laughter rang through the air.


"My answer's the same as before. I do not accept,"she said.


Vivian's smile vanished in an instant. "You think teaming up with Millie will help you? I can crush your plans before they even start."


She stepped closer, her glare sharp.


"You've seen Crobert's buzz today. That's my doing.Evans Entertainment? Screw them! I have Brandon.When I want something, Brandon agrees. Work with me, and you'll have Watson Group behind you." Her voice dropped to a hiss. "Defy me, and it won't end well for you."


Vivian kept her words vague, wary of recordings, but the threat was clear.


Vivian had the kind of influence that could sway
public opinion overnight-power that could make or break a career.



Millie only smiled, the sound of her light, mocking laugh making Vivian's anger spike.


"You ungrateful witch!"


Vivian lunged, hand raised, but Millie caught her wrist mid-swing.


"This makeup wasn't cheap. Don't ruin it," Millie said lightly.


She pushed Vivian aside.


"You!" Vivian seethed but then through gritted teeth."Just wait, Eva. I'll be here when you come crawling back."



She had planned to humiliate this detestable woman,crush her underfoot.



Millie said nothing, watching her with cold detachment.




She wondered how long it would take for Vivian to
trip over her own schemes.


Vivian stormed off.


Millie wandered to the floor-to-ceiling window and looked down. Brandon was leaning against the car,cigarette in hand.


He glanced up, catching her gaze.


Millie didn't look away.


Her makeup was so convincing it could make a person dizzy if they stared too long.


They stared into each other's souls. Neither spoke.


Then Vivian appeared outside, pouting furiously.


"Brandon! I'm so mad!"



Brandon shot her a calm look, his expression unreadable, as though nothing she did could ruffle him.



Vivian huffed and climbed into the passenger seat.


Brandon flicked his cigarette into the trash bin,
opened the driver's door, and looked up again.


Millie was gone.


He shrugged and got into the car.







Days passed.


Vivian continued pushing Love of Vivian. Ads flooded every corner.


On the third day, she began dropping subtle jabs at Millie online, claiming the project was entirely her own and unrelated to Watson Group. Johnny's people fanned the flames, steering the conversation in her favor.



On the fourth day, presales opened.


The hype had built for a full week.


The marketing was everywhere-people had seen the news at least once, often more.


With emotional, motivational promotions, presale
numbers were solid.


And Millie?



She was busy bringing Ari home.


After much work, Ari's adoption papers came through, and Millie could finally bring her back.


They had talked about moving in with Myron, but the noise around Love of Vivian kept Millie from making the change. They then decided to wait until things quieted down.


For now, Millie and Ari were still staying in the apartment Millie had rented.


On the seventh evening, as midnight struck, the premiere of Love of Vivian began.
###Chapter 238 Infringement Issue (Part One)





Most theater screenings remained locked for tomorrow's daytime slots, with only Crobert daring to offer a midnight showing.


Though marketed as a "midnight screening," the actual curtain would rise at 12:05 AM.



To amplify the buzz surrounding Love of Vivian,Vivian declared she would broadcast live at precisely 8 PM that evening before the premiere.


A grand promotional spectacle would unfold both in cyberspace and the physical world, with the offline venue positioned strategically beside Crobert's flagship cinema.


The moment Vivian's announcement hit the airwaves,Evans Entertainment struck back with a scorching statement.
The declaration demanded Vivian immediately halt her infringement violations; should she proceed with her 8 PM promotional blitz, Evans Entertainment would slam the door on any future negotiations.


Evans Entertainment commanded a vast roster of talent beneath their corporate umbrella, which meant their official account attracted legions of devoted followers.



The inflammatory statement ignited a wildfire of heated discussions across platforms.


"What twisted turn of events led to this? How exactly did Vivian cross the infringement line?"


"Absolutely baffling! Love of Vivian stands poised for its grand premiere. Why manufacture such chaos at this critical moment?"



Johnny's strategic team swooped into action,expertly manipulating the tide of public sentiment.


"Millie aligned herself with Charles' entertainment empire. Don't Millie and Vivian still wage their bitter
rivalry? Millie refuses to watch Vivian triumph, so she's orchestrating deliberate sabotage against Love of Vivian's box office potential!"



The digital crowd swarmed with wild theories and heated speculation.



Johnny watched the digital battlefield unfold and signaled his team into action.


Within moments, another viral comment materialized from the digital ether.



" witnessed Vivian's livestream from Serenity Villa and initially thought her behavior crossed ethical lines. However, Millie now appears far more ruthless;Vivian, at least, offered genuine apologies and terminated her luxury villa project. Millie and Charles are now launching vicious smear campaigns against Vivian, deploying merciless business warfare. The whole situation reeks of corruption!"



This pointed comparison twisted the narrative spotlight toward cutthroat corporate tactics,effectively obscuring the original infringement
accusations.



The online battleground erupted with unprecedented intensity.


Millie and her allies had gathered within Evans Entertainment's corporate headquarters.



Evening shadows stretched across the city as sunset painted the sky in bloodied crimson hues, and Millie's eyes found the clock-6:30 PM sharp.


"The opposition has seized control of the narrative flow," Seville announced while orchestrating his response squad.



Millie maintained her composure at the polished conference table, her sharp gaze analyzing the streaming data that flickered across multiple screens.



"Steer public perception carefully-say things like this event contains too many dramatic reversals, so we must wait for Evans Entertainment to unveil concrete evidence at 8 PM," Millie commanded with
quiet authority.


"Understood completely!"



Seville immediately sprang into coordinated action.



Millie absorbed the symphony of rapid keystrokes surrounding her, and then raised her gaze toward the darkening sky beyond the office windows.



Meanwhile, Vivian leisurely browsed through an elegant bridal catalog while maintaining her conversation with Johnny.



"They've already deployed their opening gambit,"Johnny reported with clinical precision.



Vivian's smile carried dismissive indifference as she turned another glossy page.



"They amount to nothing more than a circus troupe of performing clowns. I predicted they'd create mayhem today.Whatever bribes Charles offered Eva to secure her loyalty matters little; ultimnate victory will belong to me alone."

Vivian's eyes ignited with sudden inspiration.


Elsewhere, high within the towering Watson Group headquarters, Brandon stood in solitary contemplation before the CEO office's expansive floor-to-ceiling windows, his expression maintaining perfect stillness without the slightest emotional tremor.







Time crawled forward through the heated online warfare, finally reaching the crucial 7 PM milestone.


The digital discourse had metamorphosed into elaborate conspiracy theories surrounding Millie's true motivations.



Countless spectators positioned themselves as eager observers, hungrily anticipating the promised drama scheduled for eight o'clock.



As speculation reached fever pitch, Millie's personal social media account published a mysteriously cryptic update.
The post appeared bizarrely out of character,resembling something she had accidentally published without intention-",."


A simple comma, followed by a solitary period.


This enigmatic combination immediately ignited a firestorm of speculation across social media platforms.



What hidden meaning lurked behind these punctuation marks?



What earth-shattering significance did this carry at such a pivotal moment?



The online frenzy exploded with unprecedented velocity.


#Millie,.rocketed to trending status within minutes.


In record time, every individual who needed to witness this development had absorbed the news.



Countless users remained baffled by the mysterious symbols, while Vivian dismissed the post with
contemptuous laughter, declaring, "Absolutely perfect, this amplifies Love of Vivian's publicity reach. She's unwittingly promoting my success."


At Evans Entertainment headquarters, Millie observed the avalanche of comments cascading across her screen, her expression maintaining ethereal tranquility.


The comma represented Vivian's final opportunity to minimize her inevitable losses. The period symbolized that the conclusion approached with relentless certainty.



If retaliation was destined to unfold, the larger the audience, the more devastating the impact would prove.



Long ago, Millie had competed in Heavenly Melody using the pseudonym Serena, carefully protecting her true identity due to the necessity of maintaining complete anonymity during her complicated divorce proceedings. She had desperately wanted to prevent anyone from discovering that Eva was merely another facet of her creative identity.
Subsequently, as she watched Vivian embark on her perilous gamble of producing independent miniseries, Millie waited with predatory patience for the release, burning with anticipation to strike decisively.


At long last, judgment day had materialized before her eyes.





She could no longer stand idle while Vivian brazenly claimed ownership of her original composition and reaped enormous profits from the deception.







Time marched forward with inexorable purpose.


The clock hadn't even struck 8 PM, yet the cinema grounds already teemed with enthusiastic crowds.
###Chapter 239 Infringement Issue (Part Two)





Fortunately, dedicated security personnel managed the standard entrance pathways; otherwise,complete gridlock would have paralyzed all movement.



Vivian had positioned herself strategically early and currently waited within the plush confines of her luxury transportation van.


She basked in the glow of steadily climbing pre-sale figures, waves of deep satisfaction washing over her calculating mind.



"Brandon, look at these remarkable numbers! The statistics exceed all expectations," Vivian announced with triumphant enthusiasm, extending the tablet toward Brandon's direction.



Seated beside her imposing presence, Brandon
maintained his characteristic composure, refusing even a cursory glance at the device, instead remaining locked in brooding contemplation.


Vivian compressed her lips into a thin line, retrieved the tablet with sharp movements, and placed it deliberately on the surface before them.


Throughout recent days, Brandon had exhibited this same distant behavior, and she found herself unable to decipher the thoughts churning behind his impassive facade.


Nevertheless, it held little importance; Vivian radiated confidence, knowing that within three weeks, he would be legally bound to marry her.


Brandon harbored strong opposition to Vivian's decision to launch Love of Vivian into the marketplace, but her iron determination left him powerless to prevent her chosen course, forcing him to reluctantly permit her advancement.


Armed with the damning evidence they possessed,Charles could easily expose Vivian's deception.
Once the unvarnished truth emerged from the shadows, Eva's reputation would achieve complete vindication, and Brandon believed he could methodically handle the resulting aftermath then.



His singular desire focused on enduring these remaining four months and fulfilling their binding agreement, and then allowing everything to restore itself to its original state.


"If circumstances had unfolded differently...


Well,such speculation serves no purpose," Brandon reflected within the confines of his troubled thoughts.


Unable to tolerate the suffocating atmosphere any longer, Brandon manufactured a plausible excuse,grasped his mobile device, and stepped outside to make.a call.



He navigated toward a secluded corner to indulge in his smoking habit.



Recently, his cigarette consumption had increased
dramatically beyond his normal patterns.



The ascending smoke veiled his weathered features as he tilted his head upward toward the obsidian night sky, watching a distant aircraft traverse overhead, leaving behind a gossamer trail of clouds in its wake.



He remained oblivious to the fact that during this fleeting moment, another vehicle glided past his position and settled into a parking space on the opposite side.



The car transporting Millie and Charles,accompanied by their strategic team, had rolled to a complete halt.



"Our operatives have positioned themselves perfectly," Charles announced with barely contained excitement coursing through his voice.



Millie acknowledged with a firm nod, meticulously reviewing every detail of their comprehensive plan.


"Charles, did you successfully retrieve the archived
recording from the studio session?" Millie inquired with calculated precision.



Charles confirmed with enthusiasm, "Luckily you recorded the demo in our own studio. I've already located the records from that specific session and conducted thorough voiceprint analysis."



The more Charles contemplated their strategic advantage, the more exhilaration surged through his entire being.



They had definitively confirmed that Love of Vivian incorporated substantial portions of that original demo recording. Even if Vivian had legitimately purchased usage rights for Glimmer of Love,exploiting that demo crossed into absurd territory because Vivian herself had never performed those vocals.



Their audacious plan even involved weaponizing that demo recording to systematically dismantle Millie's Yesterday.



The promotional venue pulsated with enthusiastic
crowds gathering from every direction.


Millie cracked open the car window slightly,intercepting fragments of animated conversations drifting through the evening air.


"Absolutely, I've come specifically to experience Love of Vivian. The song Glimmer of Love resonates so deeply with my soul-its profound message truly touched my heart," declared one passionate fan.


"I share those exact sentiments, though I find myself gravitating toward the demo version rather than the polished official release," another voice responded thoughtfully.


"Precisely my feelings! I adore the raw recording studio demo version above all others. They featured it prominently throughout their promotional campaigns. My anticipation has reached incredible heights!" someone else added with infectious enthusiasm.



"But what about Evans Entertainment's damaging statement..." Another voice faded into uncertainty.
"Vivian will undoubtedly provide satisfactory explanation. Anyone capable of creating a song like Glimmer of Love possesses genuine artistic integrity.My faith in her remains unshakeable," came the loyal response.








Beneath such intense public examination, Vivian positioned herself within the livestream studio wearing an ethereal white dress.



The strategic illumination enhanced her deliberately applied makeup, creating a pallid and fragile appearance that amplified her carefully cultivated image of vulnerability.



"Good evening to all my devoted followers." Vivian offered a graceful nod toward the camera lens with practiced elegance.



"Welcome to tonight's special live broadcast..." she began, weaving together charming persona anecdotes that painted her in a favorable light.
The off-line viewers responded with overwhelming enthusiasm and engagement.


Subsequently, she delivered another stirring rendition of Glimmer of Love before her captivated audience.



However, the online spectators refused satisfaction and persistently demanded answers regarding Evans Entertainment's explosive public statement.


"Oh my, why does everyone keep pressing me about this particular matter?" Vivian concluded her musical performance,paused to sip delicately from her water glass, and projected an expression of weary exasperation. "Truth possesses its own inherent strength, and frankly, there's absolutely nothing more to elaborate upon."



Not far from her location, Charles released a bitter laugh charged with righteous anger upon hearing her brazen dismissal.


Millie, meanwhile, maintained her composed demeanor and waited with predatory patience.
"If you absolutely insist upon receiving a direct answer..." Vivian appeared reluctantly compelled to respond due to the relentless barrage of demanding comments flooding her screen. "No infringement violation exists whatsoever. I remain completely baffled by whatever Evans Entertainment believes they're referencing. Glimmer of Love represents my original creative work, and I have previously shared the intimate creative journey behind its conception.Love of Vivian stands as an extension built entirely upon my musical foundation."



Upon absorbing Vivian's defiant words, Millie's eyes transformed into razor-sharp blades of focused intensity.



Every previous statement Vivian had ever made paled into insignificance compared to this moment of blatant public denial.



What they desperately needed was for Vivian to declare "No infringement violation exists" before thousands of live witnesses.
At this critical juncture, Millie turned her penetrating gaze toward Seville with unmistakable intent.




"The moment for action has finally arrived," she commanded with quiet authority.
###Chapter 240 Reveal Identity





The moment Vivian's words hit the public, a wave of backlash against Millie flooded in.



"Everyone knows Glimmer of Love was Vivian's original creation. If there'd been an issue before, why didn't anyone speak up? Now they're just accusing her to ruin Love of Vivian's rise on the charts!"



"Millie's only acting out of jealousy. She's been writing and singing for years, but she's never managed to outshine Vivian. This is just her way of trying to drag Vivian down!"



"How disgraceful!"



"Millie is horrible!"







But before the insults could snowball further, Evans Entertainment fired back immediately.
Their official account posted a statement along with a copy of a legal notice, originally sent right after Vivian's first public performance of Glimmer of Love,in which she had claimed it as her own work.



The notice made it plain that the song had been written by Eva, only to be forcibly purchased by Vivian and Brandon.



Millie reposted the statement without hesitation.



The effect was instant. A storm broke out online.



"So you're telling me Vivian didn't write Glimmer of Love at all, and the real songwriter is someone named Eva?"



"The legal notice has dates and timestamps, and it even shows a record of it being emailed directly to Vivian."



"Didn't Glimmer of Love get re-recorded later with an Eva in the credits? Wait-is that the same Eva? Could Vivian really have..."
Questions for Vivian started flying almost instantly.



And Vivian had been expecting this moment.


With a faint smile, she placed a rose into a vase and asked softly, "Do you believe them?"


Under the spotlight, she looked flawless.



The sorrow in her eyes mixed with quiet strength,drawing sympathy from those watching.


A staff member nearby muttered, "We never should've gone to Evans Entertainment to re-record Glimmer of Love back then. We thought that since Eva helped a little, we'd added her name. Now they're twisting it to attack you!"


Only when the staffer member finished did Vivian speak."Enough."



Her manner radiated innocence and kindness.



But the damage has been done, their words had already gone out live-stream.


The scene buzzed with chatter, and the noise quickly
spilled online.


"Vivian tried to be kind and ended up being used by Evans Entertainment and Millie!"



"Eva-whoever you are, say something! What's the truth?"



"Evans Entertainment should start a live-stream-if they've got proof, show it. Otherwise, stop throwing around baseless claims!"



"And Millie, stay out of it. This is between Eva and Vivian! Quit trying to grab attention!"



Demands for answers flooded the Internet.



At the venue, someone even set up a projector,pulling up Evans Entertainment's official account page and displaying its freshly updated feed for everyone to see.



All around her, reactions unfolded, and Vivian struggled to keep the satisfied smile from breaking across her face.


Another flower was clipped and set neatly into the vase.



What chance did Eva, a mere small-time singer, have of ever beating her?



And Charles? He was nothing more than Millie's lapdog. Taking him down would be effortless.


Vivian's focus returned to her flowers, arranging them with deliberate care.



"Let's move on to the next step," Millie said softly as she watched Vivian from a distance, All eyes shifted to the massive screen as Evans Entertainment's social media feed began updating in real time.


The new post read. "Here is the contract both parties signed initially, with confidential sections removed."


Several photos appeared underneath.



Only select portions were visible. The rest was hidden due to confidentiality reasons.


Vivian gave a light laugh as she read it.
Turning to face the live-stream camera, she said,"This is the evidence they're so proud of? It's ridiculous. With something like this, I could frame half the industry if I wanted."


But the moment her statement ended, fresh evidence was already appearing.


Millie's eyes stayed on Vivian's self-satisfied expression as she gave a slow tap of her finger.


And then-



A new post went up from Eva's account.


The update turned out to be an image. It was a photograph of a copyright registration certificate.


Although the song had been sold, the document was a special registration for authorship rights, with all transfer details clearly marked.


Millie's eyes stayed fixed on the flood of incoming comments,her gaze unwavering.


Showing the contract and the legal notice was
merely formalities, while revealing the actual agreement and their repeated warnings proved that Vivian's actions were deliberate.



Now came the real blow.



Seville moved without hesitation, and Evans Entertainment's official account immediately reposted the evidence.



"The copyright registration for Glimmer of Love (formerly titled Glimmer of Light) can be verified on the official website."



The document made it clear that Eva was listed as the sole lyricist and composer, with Vivian's name nowhere in sight.



That single piece of evidence flipped the entire situation on its head.



Industry professionals rushed to the official website,confirming that the Evans Entertainment posted record was accurate.



On the big screen, the staff member projecting
Evans Entertainment's page followed the verification process step by step, proving its legitimacy to everyone present.


"Well, well! This is the official copyright certificate.Let's hear what Vivian has to say now," Charles said with a cold,mocking laugh.


After countless instances of Vivian teaming up with Oakley and Brandon to crush them, he had finally had enough.


Millie, however, stayed quiet, her attention locked on Vivian from across the room.



Both in the off-line venue and across the Internet,the scene had descended into chaos.



Thousands were now demanding Vivian explain the copyright registration issue.


Vivian said nothing at first. Only after she placed the last flower into the vase did she rise to her feet.



Millie watched quietly, recognizing the start of Vivian's carefully staged act.
Vivian's eyes were already rimmed with red.


" had no idea about any of this," Vivian said, her voice rang out through the microphone, carrying to both the live audience and viewers online.



A dry, bitter laugh slipped through before she added,"All I can say is the song is mine. But I barely understand how the music business works."



Her gaze locked onto the camera.


"Eva, you must be watching right now," Vivian continued, recalling the cold reception she'd received when meeting Eva a few days earlier, fueling her determination to make Eva come crawling back!


An even more hurt expression now etched on her face.



"We've known each other for ages. Back then, I was clueless, and you helped me. I was grateful, Eva.Even though the song was originally mine, I still credited you. And now, this is how you repay me?"


Tears began spilling freely down from Vivian's
cheeks.



"You talk about registrations and legalities, things l never learned. My health's been fragile, soI let you handle those details,and you..."


Another shaky, bitter laugh escaped as Vivian cried,her tears falling in an unbroken stream.



"I've always been thankful to you. I never once brought these things up. Even when you worked with Millie to write songs for Elliott Group's new products,I kept quiet. I only wished you well, but now you...


Vivian's voice trembled, her emotions spilling over,and a few people both in the room and watching online began dabbing at their eyes.



"Glimmer of Love was written before the first livestream of Heavenly Melody. Back then, I was at death's door... why would I ever do something so cruel? You know I poured my love and my despair into that song. We spent so much time together.Don't you remember? We wiped each other's tears.You know all of this, and yet you..."
The tears stopped, and Vivian fixed her gaze on the camera. "If there's even a shred of conscience left in you,come forward and explain the truth. This is your last chance. I'll forgive you, but only if you tell the truth."



Tears streamed down Vivian's face as she stared into the camera, all while secretly laughing to herself.


"Eva, did you catch that? So what if you have copyright registration?" Vivian thought with smug satisfaction.


Even if the lawsuit ended in Eva's favor, this public narrative would stain her reputation.


Eva's career would be ruined completely.


And even if Charles poured resources into supporting Eva, it wouldn't change a thing. Because public opinion was already stacked against her.


Inside their car, Charles was seething, fighting the urge to smash something.


Millie kept her eyes fixed on Vivian. Her lips curved
into a smile.


Vivian's twisting of the truth and flawless performance didn't surprise her.


Moments later, the giant screen on the venue lit up as the Evans Entertainment had started a live-stream.



The video was from a phone, the background filled with noise.





"I'm Eva." A woman's voice rang out.


Vivian's head snapped toward the screen, her eyes red. She knew Eva was about to appear on camera.


As far as Vivian was concerned, if Eva wanted to protect her future career, she'd have no choice but to stand at Vivian's side.
